0,PodCastle,A perennial favorite,5,"I adore this podcast. It takes me to far distant places, and brings me home with new ideas. I adore it."
1,PodCastle,One of the best,5,For pure storytelling entertainment and wonderful thought provoking writing PodCastle (and it’s sister shows Pseudopod and EscapePod) is the simply awsome.
2,PodCastle,MBee yorker,4,New yorker
3,PodCastle,Very could but,5,Could use more gay overtones and liberal propaganda
4,PodCastle,Exactly what the world needs,5,"Strong, good women. No dominating gender norms. Kindness winning. Transformation, redemption, resurrection, revelation... and all with gentle humor and clever silliness. I love this podcast. Thanks!"
5,PodCastle,Not what it used to be,1,"PodCastle used to be a very enjoyable podcast, with most stories worth listening to, or at least fun to listen to. You would have an occasional dud, but overall it was worth your time.
But about a year ago, the new editors took it in a very different direction. Nowadays almost all of the published stories are written by women, with many stories having only the barest trappings of fantasy while sending a “message”, often involving oppression or violence against marginalized groups or women. In effect, Podcastle has morphed into a feminist/LBTGQ podcast with a social justice theme for most stories.
The big problem with this, unfortunately, is that the quality of the stories has suffered tremendously. When you deliberately exclude half of the population from publishing stories, quality will inevitably suffer. Many of the stories seem like rejects from a college creative writing class. With others, I feel like I am being beaten over the head with a very obvious social message. I also get the feeling that many of the published authors may be friends, or insiders, with the editors. I now dread the words “This is a Podcastle original”, because four out of five times I will find myself giving up after the first five or ten minutes.
What is particularly ironic is that Podcastle still promotes its “Artemis Rising” month of women authors, when in fact male authors are now quite rare in this podcast. They really need an “Apollo Rising“ month instead.
So despite what you may think by listening to this podcast, men did not quit writing fantasy a year or two ago. Quite the contrary, there is still plenty of good fantasy being written by members of both sexes. You simply won’t find it in Podcastle."
6,PodCastle,Awesome stories,5,I’ve enjoyed every story I’ve listened to on this podcast. Great selection. Some of them are going to stick with me for a long time.
7,PodCastle,Good fantasy!!,5,I enjoy their stories tremendously! Keep up the good work!
8,PodCastle,CallinTad,5,"As they come to the end of their first decade of producing weekly stories, PodCastle continues to deliver a variety of compelling stories. Like their sister podcasts, they feature a mix of classic authors and new voices, and they throw in bonus gems with their ""PodCastle Miniatures"" from time to time. A true community-made, listener-supported labor of love!"
9,PodCastle,An Inspiration,5,"Podcastle is truly my favorite fiction podcast. Under all of the editors who've managed it, Podcastle has brought beautiful, unique, touching, brilliant, and progressive stories from dozens of sub-genres of fantasy, and they've had fun while doing it.
Its introduced me to awesome authors whose short fiction was featured on the cast. Thanks to the vision of its editorial staff, these authors bring perspectives lacking in a field long dominated by white cis-gendered dudes. Their writing has made my dreams richer, and my reality more nuanced. I have laughed, gasped alound, and wept to more episodes than I can count.
Podcastle is for every nerd, every freak, every dreamer who is curious about where fantasy can take us, and who is brave enough to have expectations turned upside-down. Thanks for the years of great listening, Podcastle."
10,PodCastle,good but kinda bias,4,I listen every week and love the venue and the people. However if you are looking for classical type fantasy they kinda steer away from that. The stories seem to lean to the feminine.
11,PodCastle,Pod Castle,5,One of the best podcast
12,PodCastle,"Good, but boring.",3,"I know what Podcastle is trying to achieve, and I think they succeed, because of how many great reviews there are. I just don't think it's for me. I find many of the stories boring and uninteresting. I will still listen to pseudopod though, that one is awesome! So I want to say keep it up, because you are obviously doing something right - it's just not my cup of tea."
13,PodCastle,The Fantasy storytelling you have been looking for.,5,"Finding good fantasy story podcast can be a little tricky. But fortunately for enthusiasts of the genre PodCastle is an excellent repository of such fiction. From Magical Kingdoms in unknown lands, to modern settings with unknown secrets just over the horizon, Podcastle provides fantasy storys from a variety of authors read by experience and professional narrators. With literally hundreds of full length and miniature podcasts available to stream or download, fantasy seekers have found what they're looking for at PodCastle.
My personal recommendations? Episode 305, Heartless, about a young woman who stands firm against a corrupt society, Episode 297, The Tower of The Elephant, a Conan the Barbarian classic from Robert Howard. Episode 286, The Calendar of Saints, about a professional duelist who's confronted with a difficult decision that will require more than skill to solve. Episode 282, The Sunshine Baron, about a man who betrayed his people, and will live to regret it. And Miniature Episode 76, Quiet Death Machines, about a young man who dream of growing up to be a supervillain."
14,PodCastle,Great stories!,5,"I love the variety of stories. It's not all knights and princesses; there's some of that, but there's plenty of stories that mix our world and other worlds together."
15,PodCastle,Long time listener,5,I've been listening since the podcast first splintered off from Escapepod. That's how great it is. Really enjoy all of the different selections.
16,PodCastle,"After 380 episodes, still great",5,"Don't you hate it when you discover the perfect podcast, and 5, 15 or 24 episodes later, gaps between installments increase, heralding impending doom. Or they get repetitive.
Not a problem with the ever enduring pod castle.
I just love short fiction, the kind that fits into one or two commutes, or a sunny hour in the park. I also love non-stereotypical fantasy.
Podcastle so far has brought 385 of these. You can listen to one a day, and still have no repeats for a year. Each story is fresh, and quite a few are original. Go get an episode and check it out."
17,PodCastle,Ostenstibly Feminist,3,"Some of the stories really have substance, but more often than not, the tales grow more and more liberally feminist; I couldn't care less about the nazi-feminist agenda. The writers they get on here write a story with a vampire motif, name the heroine, Joan of Arc, and call it ""fantasy"". No thanks! Will happily perk my ears up for Pseudopod or the Drabblecast."
18,PodCastle,Great if it wasn't for that woman,2,Love the content but when the loud crazy woman is screaming AAANNNDDD WE'RE BACK!!!! into my ears it ruins the entire episode just knowing she'll be back at the end. When there are other hosts it great. Please get rid of the bullhorn crazy loud woman. Once she's gone I'll change my rating to 5 stars.
19,PodCastle,Great podcast!,5,"I just recently started listening to the podcastle, and I have to say you're all doing a spectacular job with the production of these shows !"
20,PodCastle,Great story cast!,4,Keep it up!
21,PodCastle,Great show,5,"I love listening to this podcast at work, it keeps my mind active and engaged through the extra long shifts. Keep up the great work"
22,PodCastle,Each Story is a Spell,5,"Each story on this show --from those of high fantasy, to those of magic realism, to fantastical experiments beyond classification-- weaves its own special spell. Who knew there was such variety in the fantasy genre?"
23,PodCastle,Excellent Stories and Storytelling,5,This is my favorite podcast of fantasy stories.
24,PodCastle,Fantastic!,5,"Just sublime: I've been listening quite a while, and there are so many gems! I loved ""Telling Stories"" by Sandra M Odell, and I must have listened to ""La Heron"" three or four times at least- AMAZING adventure! Romance! Fantasy!"
25,PodCastle,One of the best Fantasy podcasts,5,"If you're a fantasy fan, then you need to add this one to your listening queue! The Escape Artists family have a long tradition of producing quality fiction and PodCastle is no exception."
26,PodCastle,Too far left,1,"Zero stars. The anti-American, anti-family, anti-anything-remotely-resembling-normal agendas of the stories have finally overwhelmed my hope for an entertaining story. I'm nauseated, & unsubscribed."
27,PodCastle,Hit and miss with talent,1,"PodCastle is one of those publications that is VERY hit and miss with real talent. They often choose to publish stories that one has to questions why they were chosen. Many of the stories leave the listener wondering what they just listened to, and not in a good way. I seldomly listen to this podcast anyomore because they don't bring forward enough good stories, but like to stick to the level of mediocre and boring. On top of the hit and miss, they also seem to have their own politcal agenda that they like to push, or rather shove, onto their listeners. I have a two friends who actually compltely stopped listening to them solely for this reason. It is a little disappointing. Until they can address and adjust both of those issues, I will leave this review as it is and will turn as many people away as possible. Hope things change."
28,PodCastle,Consistently Good,5,Always well done
29,PodCastle,Always entertaining,5,This is a must listen if you like fantasy fiction short stories. This podcast is pure gold!
