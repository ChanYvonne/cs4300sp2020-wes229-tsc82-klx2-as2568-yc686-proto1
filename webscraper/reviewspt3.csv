0,Think Again ‚Äì a Big Think Podcast,Scintillating Conversations!,5,"Stumbling onto these podcasts has been a breath of fresh air to me! The conversations are insightful, informative and all over the sphere of what it means to be human. They have taken me ‚Äòhome‚Äô to where I used to be studying Anthropology for my undergrad, before things in life distracted me from the things I enjoy to ponder. Thank you, thank you, thank you Jason!"
1,Think Again ‚Äì a Big Think Podcast,Excellent podcast!,5,"I've been listening to this show from the start. Jason just keeps getting deeper and deeper with these podcasts. The incredible conversation with Jennifer Doudna is worth listening to for everyone. I've been sharing this particular episode with friends and family.
2020 review update:
This podcast keeps getting deeper! The new format provides much more relevant prompts for conversation. Thank you!"
2,Think Again ‚Äì a Big Think Podcast,Great Podcast,5,"Think Again delivers smart, engaging, often funny interviews with people I‚Äôd mostly never heard of before, but am now glad I have. I‚Äôve found some of my favorite books, movies, and podcasts by listening to Jason Gots‚Äôs interviews and then following up with the interviewees‚Äô original works. If you are looking for something that will both spark your intellectual curiosity and engage you emotionally, look no further. It‚Äôs clear that Jason reads, watches, and listens to his subjects‚Äô material closely in order to generate exceedingly smart, dynamic conversations. Awesome.
My personal favorites (in no particular order, and keep in mind I‚Äôve missed many of Think Again‚Äôs first year of interviews):
Karen Armstrong (theologian)
Reginal Dwayne Betts (poet)
Etgar Keret (author)
Marlon James (author)
Christopher Wylie (Cambridge Analytica whistleblower)
Jill Lepore (Historian)
Jeffery Israel (political philosopher)
Eve Ensler (author of The Apology)
Wesley Yang (author of The Souls of Yellow Folk)
Jonathan Safran Foer (on factory farming)"

8,Think Again ‚Äì a Big Think Podcast,Gets my brain moving,5,"My favorite of the cerebral podcasts, although I really like ‚ÄúPhilosophize This!‚Äù too. Jason keeps it humble and pulls it apart with great questions posed to excellent guests."
9,Think Again ‚Äì a Big Think Podcast,The new logo...,1,"Is sooooo ugly, it makes me so sad and uncomfortable :("
10,Presentable,It‚Äôs growing!,5,It feels like Jeff is getting better with the questions each episode. I greatly appreciate him bring designers from a variety of fields. I alway look forward to new episode.
11,Presentable,Always listen,5,I always listen to this podcast. I am a creative director and have for a long time followed Jeff and his work since the past 15 years. The guest and his content here is very good and often challenges my thinking and perspective in ways that few other content channels do.
12,Presentable,"Wonderful, almost easy listening design podcast",5,I love listening to Presentable. It makes me help relax while learning about lots of different design topics and get to know great people. Can't recommend it highly enough!
13,Presentable,"inspiring, whether you are a designer or not",5,"While I'm a writer, not a designer, Jeff's podcast shows me the flipside of branding: look, as opposed to voice. I loved the episode about designing a space for creatives and what's most conducive to different types of work. All the episodes I've listened to have featured awesome, interesting interviewees from a wide range of disciplines. Tune in!"
14,Presentable,Real conversations about design + more,5,"Presentable is one of my favorite podcasts because it is about so much more than design. Not being a designer myself, I find Jeff's conversations cover everything from politics to art to research. The insight from Jeff himself, as well as his guests, has impacted my work thinking processes and the way I think about products I interact with. Every episode is a great listen, diverse, and thought provoking. Must listen -- for designers and non designers!"
15,Presentable,Insightful and Inspiring,5,A colleague turned me on to this podcast and I'm so glad they did. Each episode provides a wonderful glimpse into the world of UX from the perspectives and experiences of other UX Designers facing similar challenges in our field. It's great to hear others share their stories and possible solutions and know I'm not alone‚Äîor crazy!‚Äîin my thinking. Thanks Jeff and keep up the good work!

25,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Friend,5,"I Love this podcast! It has been great in the past, but right now, during this Covid thing, Michael has been inspirational and amazing!"
26,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Dr. Dain Heer‚Äôs Interview,1,"Such an irresponsible episode. Had to turn it off. Yes, I'm all about not buying into the media‚Äôs hype during these turbulent times but to completely downplay what's going on and boast about giving hugs at the Dentist office because you're not afraid of getting ‚Äùsome virus‚Äù has to be one of the most ignorant statements I've heard throughout all of this."
27,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,COVID interview,2,"I listened to Dr. Dain Heer‚Äôs interview. Pure negligence to say it‚Äôs ok to hug during the COVID pandemic, and that isolation is worse than the virus. Made me sick to listen to. Social isolation IS real and necessary. Listening to the news is important now. We need information. Hundreds of people are dying every day in the U.S. and everywhere from SUFFOCATION. What‚Äôs true is that this virus needs to be stopped. Get your head out of the clouds, this is serious. I was shocked that Michael would even be a part of such an interview. It‚Äôs time for facts, not feelings. We‚Äôre in survival mode. Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I DO see the love and light despite it all.
I do appreciate that Michael has toned down the manic ‚Äúwoo-hoos‚Äù. I do love the show over all."
28,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,One of best if Not the BEST,5,Just listened to another interview and Michael knocked it out of the park. Michael has the best podcast I‚Äôve ever had pleasure to listen. I‚Äôm all about being natural and real to self spirit and soul. His guests are the best. And Michael is the best interviewer! Good Work Michael!!
29,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,I‚Äôm hooked,5,"Michael and Jessica, you both bring on the best people to interview. I‚Äôm so grateful I came across your podcast. I‚Äôm hooked!"
30,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Inspire nation,3,I do enjoy this show ..But lately it seems to have a lot of reruns and when CJ Lui is on as a guest I skip it ... Whatever they talk about has nothing to do with the title and it‚Äôs just boring ... The first years were awesome!!
31,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Best spirituality and self help show,5,I‚Äôve yet to listen to an episode that made me feel any less than better. I always feel great after hearing Michael interview his amazing guests!
32,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,So many ‚ÄúWooo Hooo‚Äôs‚Äù,2,I wanted to enjoy this however it can be very distracting with the many ‚Äúwoo hoo‚Äôs‚Äù throughout the episode.
33,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Great interviews,5,"I always learn a lot on this show. Michael is a talented interviewer and gets things from those he interviews that I haven‚Äôt heard elsewhere. While there are certain things I can‚Äôt quite go along with as a Christian (spirit guides, the Universe over the one true God), there‚Äôs still much to be gained from the wide variety of guests. It‚Äôs definitely one of my top podcasts I listen to regularly."
34,Inspire Nation | Daily Inspiration - Motivation - Meditation | Law of Attraction | Health | Career | Spirituality | Self-Help,Hard to focus,1,The whooohooo is sooo annoying. If not for this I might enjoy the content.

45,Black Girl In Om,Yay!,5,"So Excited for your return!

46,Black Girl In Om,‚ú®,5,So so good.
47,Black Girl In Om,WHEWWW CHILEEEE,5,"For starters let me just say that the way that the most recent episode (destigmatizing your desire) just aligned my root and sacral chakras is MAGICAL and OH SO ON TIME to say the least. now that i have finished college i feel that i am in a new season of my life and entering a new chapter in my spiritual journey. one of the things i've been praying and asking God for guidance in is feeling strong/powerful in my body. since putting that out into the universe it seems that i have been getting revelation after revelation and it all boils down to me feeling comfortable and confident in the body i was created in. as someone who was exposed to porn very young, sexuality is something that has always been part of my life in private. i feared being ""sexy and proud"" outloud because i was operating from a place of shame and judgment due to the topic of sex being a taboo in my childhood. my older brother's advice when he found out i lost my viginity at 16 was, ""just dont be a hoe"" so i have been subscribed to the mindset of being a ""good girl"" and keeping my sexual being hidden...which has been a drag to say the least. overtime i experienced various forms of sexual trauma that made it difficult for me to be intimate with someone i can say that i truly love, trust, and want to do life with overall. i am now in a place where i'm ready to reclaim my sensuality as the ratchet, righteous, renassiance woman that i am and this podcast completely affirmed the journey i'm embarking on along with the numeric messages i've been getting from my guardian angels. there is so much more i could share but i'll conclude with thankfulness‚Äìso incredibly grateful for the work you women do. can't wait to continue aligning my charkas and rejuvenating my edges with BGIO. love and light always xx ebony"
48,Black Girl In Om,Throat chakra Liberation,5,I‚Äôve been listening for a few months. I definitely had to check out this episode after reading the intro. Let me just say my mind is blown by Ev‚ÄôYan‚Äôs throat chakra theory. It makes so much sense. Thank you all for creating a space to discuss such issues that often go unaddressed in our communities.
49,Black Girl In Om,Yes my sistaaasssss,5,This podcast has motivated me to walk more in alignment with wanting to start my own holistic business. They talk with so many black women about their holistic crafts. Ugh just love them. Speaking it into existence that I‚Äôll be talking on here with them one day üò≠
50,Black Girl In Om,Thank you!,5,Thank you for #42!! I now know what to do to heal and strengthen my sexual relationship with my husband and myself.
51,Black Girl In Om,Thank you for guiding my growth!,5,"LOVEEEEE!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
This podcast changed my life. Truly. I have been listening y‚Äôall for about 2 year now and the growth has been huge! From working on my physical strength and wealth to coming up to a 1 year anniversary with my therapist. Y‚Äôall truly inspired me to work through my traumas and healing from loss. Thank you!!"
52,Black Girl In Om,Love this podcast,5,"Gives me the support system that I never had and still don‚Äôt have. I imagine they are my sister‚Äôs giving me the advice I need by talking about their experiences, their guests, and answering the fans questions.

56,Black Girl In Om,Work in Progress,3,"Good concept, needs more direction, sincerity and depth. Hosts also need to work on their interviewing skills and maybe screen clients to make sure their discussion has purpose, direction and focus. Lot of rambling on both ends."
57,Black Girl In Om,Calm Vibes ~,5,"I love the conversations, the intro ‚ÄúOm‚Äù , and just the chemistry of these ladies! Keep shinning and blessing everyone connected üß° @empwrexperience"

60,Black Girl In Om,Kjonesdo,5,That episode with Rev. Angel Williams is a masterpiece! By far my favorite episode! Hope there‚Äôs a part 2 coming.
61,Black Girl In Om,Representation Matters,5,"So freaking excited for a podcast that totally relates to ME as a BLACK WOMAN! Yes! This is everything! Well spoken, educated, woke, witty, funny, and relatable women who continue to inspire and SPEAK! The spiritual black woman is so very powerful. I just love how they introduce us to other BOSS black babes, who are impacting our community for the better! We matter and our representation totally matters! Thank you ladies! :)"
62,Black Girl In Om,Grateful,5,"Thank you for sharing tips, past experiences & your inner most thoughts. As a 20something black woman, I can‚Äôt think of a better word to describe how your podcast/brand makes me feel. The word is grateful! Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠"
63,Black Girl In Om,You‚Äôre Impactful,5,You‚Äôre dialogue encourages people to develop insight on their past and come to self actualization. I have recommended this to my 12th grade girls because they lack women who can express life from this perspective. So thank you. Keep speaking to black womens mental emotional and spiritual health that helps heal young girls from traumatic experiences in their lives so far. üíï

75,My Seven Chakras,Jen lee,5,Great host & content!
76,My Seven Chakras,A step on the spiritual ladder,5,I have been seeking spiritual growth and development. I am intrigued with the notion of mind power and it‚Äôs relationship with ‚Äúreality‚Äù. I was looking for a podcast for a long drive and was led to this one. As I listened to my first episodes I became so excited and optimistic for all of the potential that is offered. I‚Äôm only at the beginning of this journey but I have a feeling that this podcast is an important step on my ladder of spiritual ascendancy.
77,My Seven Chakras,Always inspiring!,5,"Thank you AJ I just recently discovered your podcasts and can only say keep going! The topics, guests and information are so interesting. Also, your kind words bring joy to my heart. With lots of gratitude-Kate (New Jersey)"

I was the ring on for the FC in Vegas I was leaving the casino valet driver runs me over with my own car. 15 years earlier I was another horrible car accident. But let me say and biggest challenges in life most likely will be your biggest gifts!! So after 36 major operations every year 31 years and then also studying this has been the most magical experience of my life and my healing I rewired my neurological brain on the cells in my body. I‚Äôm going to look you about did quickly. I did not want to miss anything and he said because you‚Äôre binocular is between scientific and real people which is really something special. Normally the scientist in the doctors think one way and the teachers speak another way. This is I would think and as being very Thibodeau would imagine that you have had your own experience that was pretty challenging of a journey. Or maybe it was your last life. I want to thank you tremendously for being exquisite and what you do. I will go do more research on you because that‚Äôs the type of person I am I have to know everything I‚Äôm still studying after 27 years and I‚Äôm also studying with Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi as my coaches. Do you have something very special that other people don‚Äôt possess and it‚Äôs coming through from your authenticity. I‚Äôm finishing studying in advance course with Susan Mor... I know everything that she is saying but I had to start there because she doesn‚Äôt really know who I am I didn‚Äôt know I was I‚Äôm going to take the next level and it‚Äôs always good to hear from somebody else and know that you are hundred percent of course thank you I don‚Äôt know what I was on Howard Stern to.

I‚Äôm very proud of you keep it up the world needs it and obviously it‚Äôs your passion peace, love, happiness, joy, compassion and always sent out to you. Yes and they were in your magic. You‚Äôre wonderful warmly, Stacy Rosman PS I do not take any kind of medicine not even Advil and my pain level 0-out of a seven. Often people come to me and legally I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs appropriate for myself to handle it I don‚Äôt know what your medical background is but I would be interested in because I would be happy to turn them over to you. I know I could do it but I‚Äôm not going to do something out of the realm of the legal system

It‚Äôs very real, knowledgeable, and positive nature will leave you feeling, refreshed, happy, and motivated!"
87,My Seven Chakras,Mindset to Lifestyle,5,"I religiously listen to this podcast while I paint, especially when I am feeling anxious. It helps ground me to the present moment and I really start to flow with my art work. It has made shifts to my mindset which transfer to my lifestyle because it helps me get to know myself, my beliefs, what I love, what I fear, what is and isn‚Äôt important to me. It puts me in a habitual state of gratitude which is extremely transformative and fulfilling in all areas of life. Proud to be apart of the action tribe! Thank you AJ."

89,My Seven Chakras,AJ (My Morning Cup of Joe) And so much more!,5,"ü¶ãI found AJ‚Äôs podcast last year in December. I immediately fell in love with his show.

I have since listened to well over a dozen different podcasts by AJ and my mind is swirling and expanding. His choice of guests are quite remarkable, but even more so, AJ truly expresses and comes from a place of interest and caring. He is truly engaged and often asks questions, that I believe so many of us would, not just accepting but truly interacting and raising the bar on learning.

I stumbled across episode 99 entitled ‚Äú7 tips for the over 40 Metabolism‚Äù and have been hooked ever since. The episode was full of valuable information and answered so many questions I had about why I was struggling with getting results in my attempts to lose weight. I subscribed right away and went back to episode 1 and began listening to all past episodes. The episodes are timeless, informative, helpful and peppered with ‚Äúgolden nuggets‚Äù as cohosts, Dr. Ray and Blythe, like to call their key take aways from each episode.

124,Cut The Fat Weight Loss Podcast | Weight Loss Motivation | Diet Advice | Lose Weight | Fitness,Impacted more than my exercise and diet,5,"These podcasts have changed the way I look at food and fitness. I started out with only 5-10 pounds to lose. As I listened to the podcasts starting with the first one, I realized it was not just about counting calories to lose the extra weight I put on during the last year while dating my foodie boyfriend. It became about a lifestyle change I wanted to make that involved taking on healthy eating and fitness behavior for the rest of my life. I learned the most effective and efficient way to achieve my goal and the scientific rationale behind my choice of daily decisions about food, exercise, and activity. These podcasts also have wisdom that you can apply to the rest of your life for example: each day you have an opportunity to move toward or away from your goal. This can apply to any goals in your life. The two hosts of the show are brilliant, compassionate and funny. They renewed my love for understanding how the body works. I now read information related to diet and exercise for pleasure just like I read information on mindfulness, meditation etc... I‚Äôve even started cooking because the recipes they share are simple and meet my dietary goals. The podcasts have lead me down the right path and kept me from being scattered about how to achieve my goal which have changed from the start of my journey by becoming broader with a life long focus. Thank you for being more than a cheering leading team who teaches one to count calories. I love all the scientific education!!!"
125,House Call With Dr. Hyman,Politics and food,5,"I like Dr Hyman because he realizes that even food has been politicized. He is alert and bold enough to address it and try to correct it. Thank you Dr Hyman! Because of that, I‚Äôm a devoted fan. If we don‚Äôt speak up we become complicit. Thank you for speaking up and acting out."
126,House Call With Dr. Hyman,Liberal,1,"I thought I liked Dr Hyman, but like all liberals we have to bring politics into the health topic arena. As quickly as I subscribed, I‚Äôm out."

130,House Call With Dr. Hyman,Is meat as bad as we think,2,"The message regarding meat is very good. However, in your examples of why you have to be careful with studies you reference the woman‚Äôs health initiative Study on estrogen and hormones. You say that this study proved the other study wrong but didn‚Äôt also say what was flawed with the NHS study. Would love you to listen to The Drive #42Avrum Bluming podcast. I know I really value your opinion and this is a very important issue for woman to get right. The right kind of estrogen is critical for woman‚Äôs health."

Now not only boring but untrustworthy and lacking any ideas of his own
A shame"
134,House Call With Dr. Hyman,Dr. Mark Hyman Has the Answers!,5,"Four months ago, I was overweight, overwhelmed, and ‚Äúover it‚Äù. I was suffering from intense brain fog, moderate depression, probable autoimmune issues, a quick temper and excessive fatigue/forgetfulness/confusion.
One weekend, I decided to drag myself out of the house and I wound up in Barnes and Nobles. Browsing through the Health and Wellness section, my hand landed on Dr. Hyman‚Äôs book, Food. What the Heck Should I Eat?
Desperate, I decided to take the plunge head first and adopt all of the principles that he outlined in the book. The first benefits happened pretty quickly after changing my diet. I gained more energy and I lost 13 pounds almost immediately.
Encouraged, I began listening to every podcast that Dr. Hyman broadcasted. (It‚Äôs easy. I just listen to them when I‚Äôm traveling to and from work). I listened to the entire Broken Brain series as well.
To keep the momentum going, I found a Functional Medicine doctor in my area that helped me in my journey by suggesting vitamins and supplements that benefit me (Vitamin D3, fish oil, B vitamins, etc) based on my blood tests. He also suggested that I work out. (Drat! Not what I was hoping to hear. Lol). So I jump on my stair stepper for 30 minutes each night. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgetting after it‚Äù by any means. I‚Äôm just MOVING.
And lo and behold, after all of that, I am remembering things that I thought were long forgotten (like the names of my grade school teachers!)
I believe with all my heart that Dr. Hyman and his staff REALLY want to help us! Not only is he insanely logical and smart, but he is also caring and compassionate.
He changed my life and he can change yours too!

135,House Call With Dr. Hyman,"Very helpful, a new way to think about health and weight loss",5,"This is a science based, applied method to food and diet. Since I began following Dr. Hyman, I have reversed my anxiety, gotten off anxiety medications, now have loads of energy and additionally I lost those ""last ten pounds"".

This book will encourage others to stand up as well."

172,The Sheepdog Project,The best!,5,One of my favorite things about this podcast is when Mike smacks his lips while drinking his beverages. It really lets the audience know that he is staying hydrated. Keep up the good work mike!
173,The Sheepdog Project,Edit out,5,"The mouth noises are over exagerated when recorded. If I am sitting in the same room with you, I cant hear your mouth and throat noises, but when your recording and then its on ou rspeakers, its kinda gross to hear all the mouth noises. Its equivelant to a person placing thier mouth in close proximity to your ear and doing it. I love the content, but cant listen to all that without gagging a bit. Maybe its just me, but most podcast have it edited out, or mics that wont allow it to be picked up."
174,The Sheepdog Project,Boring,1,Stop smacking on what ever u are drinking. Obnoxious...

What I love about your style, Matthew, is your ability to convey any message with such conviction and courage. I love the gentle, yet authoritative way that you give the listener the tools, and I find this to be one of your many gifts and talents. It's no wonder you are one of the top self-help podcasters on iTunes. Yes, You are! And I am sure you have given up many-a-story to remind yourself of that. I am glad to also serve as one of your reminders.
Cheers to you, my dear friend, for being so undeniably powerful. I am truly inspired.

179,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,A staple in bettering yourself!!,5,"I‚Äôm not sure how I stumbled across this podcast but I‚Äôm SO glad I did. I listen to a few other motivational podcasts daily but this one is by far my favorite and I always tend to listen to first. Some times I look at the titles for the having it A.L.L podcasts and think oh this won‚Äôt pertain to me.. but it ALWAYS does!! There is always something to learn and take away from each podcast.
I have learned the root causes of so much of my anxiety/depression and why I was feeling certain ways- and just a better outlook on my life. It‚Äôs not 100% all the time, but I‚Äôm making progress! Even close friends have commented on how my thinking has changed for the good!! It‚Äôs truly been a journey to get to this point but it‚Äôs an incredible feeling and something I never truly thought I could say with confidence. I know without this podcast I would not be where I am mentally right now. Keep it up, Matthew!!! You‚Äôre doing amazing things!!"
180,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Inspirational podcast!,5,"I started listening to the Having it A.L.L podcast a few months ago during my commute. Having had recently moved away from NYC, I was having so many crazy emotions about change and this podcast really helped me gain some perspective and resonated with me on a bunch of different levels. My only suggestion would be to have more podcasts ;).
Thank you Matthew for sharing your light and magic with the world! Appreciate you!"

186,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Amazing value here!,5,"Just listened to my first entire Having It All podcast, and I am inspired! I‚Äôm also impressed and I‚Äôm grateful. The episode was the one dealing with a confidence and self worth breakdown. I found Matt to speak directly and honestly. There was zero hype and yet it was practically speaking really helpful. The dude is inCISive. And smart, too, but not all ego-driven and irritating, as some hosts can be.
I‚Äôll be heading back for more. Thanks very much, Matt. You are the MAN."
187,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Thankful Matthew Found his Calling!,5,"I found this podcast a few months ago, and while I subscribe to a few others, Matthew‚Äôs Having it A.L.L. is my go-to for inspiration and encouragement, with real-life, east to reflect on and implement strategies to guide me as I choose to live what he calls, an ‚ÄúAbundant, Loving, Life!‚Äù He has a gift- so thankful he has chosen to share his voice through a real, honest, transparent, vulnerable approach that translates to powerful, creative, insightful messages that will resonate with anyone seeking to grow, evolve, and have it A.L.L.!

I first found Matthew‚Äôs podcast in April by chance and I am so grateful for that. I am a 18 and a freshman at Vanderbilt University and this podcast has made my transition into adulthood so meaningful and intentional. If you want real change in your life listen to what Matthew has to say and internalize it. Matthew‚Äôs wisdom has provided me with a mindset shift from life happening to me to me creating the A.L.L. I want. No matter who you are, your age, or gender, Matthew has a gift of being to connect with everyone wherever they are at."

I have been listening to your podcasts for about a 2 weeks now, and just let me tell you how amazing they are!!!!

My name is Kayla Thomas I am currently a sophomore in college. I'm truly inspired but what you put out. You're podcast have helped me in a tremendous way. A little over a year ago I lost my mom to breast cancer and following that my best friend since like fourth grade and I went our separate ways then my boyfriend of two years had broken up with me. I was a mess not handling any of it well placed the blame all on myself and thought I was the problem and maybe I was but your podcast have helped my accept life as it is and to let the last be the past I can't change what happened but I accepted it and i'm learning to move on.

197,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Changed my life,5,"I was going down the rabbit hole of depression, I wanted something to inspire me and get me back mentally stable and positive.

You uplift people‚Äôs point of view from within, spiritually and mentally. Thank you."
198,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Loving accountability,5,"I learned of Matt‚Äôs podcast when he was a guest on TOB with Paul. The two seemed to jive, so I decided to check out Having it ALL. I enjoy listening to this podcast because Matt‚Äôs pretty real and authentic to the point that it kind of feels like you‚Äôre just hanging out with a friend talking through some stuff. I‚Äôve reached out to him personally, appreciated his response, and will continue to listen as I cruise on this journey. Thankfully I‚Äôve learned what that journey is all about and am appreciative :)"
199,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Awesome,5,This has to be one of the best podcast I‚Äôve listened to very down to earth honest and he doesn‚Äôt hold anything back from the beginning to the end great show
200,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,Started my journey of self healing,5,"I started listening to this podcast because I found myself in a bit of a rut about 4 or 5 months ago. The title intrigued me, but the episode ‚Äúsexual healing‚Äù did too. My fianc√© and I struggle with sexual intimacy because of my past and this episode definitely helped us open up to see how things COULD be if we are just patient and loving with ourselves and each other. Thank you to you and Sarah. This show has become a part of my regular morning routine now. It‚Äôs so uplifting that I can‚Äôt help but start my day off right."
201,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,How is this free?,5,The fact that this podcast is completely free to listen too boggles me! There‚Äôs so more correlation to my personal problems and your advice and I just want to thank you. Definitely my favorite podcast for 2019. I appreciate it and please keep doing what you‚Äôre doing.
202,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,New Listener,5,"I‚Äôm new to this world but they say better late than never! Your podcast was one of the first I came across and I am very impressed by the content of your podcasts!

204,Having It ALL: Conversations about living an Abundant Loving Life,"I‚Äôm new, but...",4,"I‚Äôm totally new to the world of podcasts but I just listened to the ‚ÄúYou are what you believe‚Äù episode and I‚Äôm obsessed! It‚Äôs simple to understand and encouraging, not overwhelming! I‚Äôm also in much need of self-motivation and self-belief so this spoke volumes to me! Y‚Äôall need to give a listen! Keep it up!!!"
205,Personality Hacker Podcast,Fantastic work,5,"I've been listening for a couple years now, and to my great shame I have consistently forgotten to write a review.
I was in a pretty bad time in my life, and long story short, because I am a caricature of myself, I listened to the INFJ episode and realized all the usual stuff about myself with all the usual intense emotion.
Ever since then, I've listened to each episode as it came out. The podcast appeals both to my intense need to categorize people and to my love of listening to great self-improvement advice and then not taking it. Antonia's intensely developed Ti makes my ten-year-old Ti feel like it's sitting at the big kids' table.
Keep on doing what you're doing."
206,Personality Hacker Podcast,In love with Joel & Antonia!,5,"I have listened to every episode of this podcast. Personality Hacker shimmers with generous insight, off-beat humor, and intelligence. This is the only Myers Briggs Podcast you need to listen to. The chemistry and rapport between Joel and Antonia is inspiring. Always original and never dull, every episode is a gem. I have gone back to some of the episodes for repeat listens! Hacker has adapted and interpreted Myers Briggs into a versatile and illuminating model. This podcast has been one of the greatest sources of support and guidance in my personal development journey, helping me to better understand and challenge myself as well as those I love!"
207,Personality Hacker Podcast,Life Changing Information,5,The level of analysis that you two provide about personalities is truly life changing. I have learned so much about who I am and learning more everyday. Thank you!
208,Personality Hacker Podcast,ENTP approved,5,"This may be a long review, I'm on a 5 hour flight with time to spare. I found out I was ENTP when I was undeclared at college. As an ENTP I always felt like I was an outsider in my own friend group and family. Especially as a woman, I felt like my differences were more apparent. Not to say that I didn‚Äôt have close friends or family, but there was a noticeable difference in the way I thought and acted compared to others. This podcast has been so helpful for me in understanding what my gifts are, why they are needed and how to refine my gifts to make them better. Listening to Antonia‚Äôs podcast on advice for ENTPs has been life changing, honestly I think I‚Äôve listened to that episode at Least 15 times. I also experienced body dysmorphia and one day I thought through the anxiety in a very logical way and realized how unnecessary those anxious thoughts were, just like Antonia! There was another podcast (I forget which one), but Antonia was telling an anecdote about how she was jiving with a group and told a joke or story that she thought would be appreciated and instead it fell totally flat and she was like ‚Äúwait, what just happened??‚Äù And just wow-I‚Äôve been there so many times being like ‚Äúwait, did I take it too far??? We were all jiving a second ago!! It‚Äôs a joke!!‚Äù I could go on and on about the parallels in Antonia‚Äôs anecdotes and my own experiences. Most importantly, my biggest take away is Antonia‚Äôs relationship with Joel. I had a very long term relationship with a guy who looking back was an ENFP. things didn‚Äôt work out because our lives were kinda moving in different directions and we don‚Äôt talk any more. listening to the dynamic between Antonia and Joel has helped me better understand that relationship and why we were completely in sync at times and why we fought at other times. ENFPs like Joel and my ex are just magical people. So yeah, this podcast is kinda made for me. As an ENTP I feel inclined to finish this review with some clever wrap up, but I got nothin‚Äô. So instead - if Antonia or Joel made it to the end of this thanks for reading!"
209,Personality Hacker Podcast,"Accessible, logical, magical, but not too woo-woo. Good stuff.",5,This podcast is an excellent resource for selfcare and exploration. Very insightful.
210,Personality Hacker Podcast,AMAZING!!!,5,Absolutely amazing! Well spoken and explained! So insightful I would highly recommend!
211,Personality Hacker Podcast,Helped me change my life,5,"I started listening to PH in earnest a year and a half ago‚Äî when I desperately needed it. I‚Äôm an INFJ social worker/therapist who was leaving graduate school and entering the toughest early years in my field. I‚Äôve long known the basics of Myers Briggs, but PH helped me apply the deeper insights of that model and many others to my life.
I‚Äôm so grateful to have gained access to this community and this podcast when I did. Antonia in particular helps clarify concepts and uses her Ti in beautifully precise ways that make sense to my Ti 10-yr-old. Hearing her share her life, thoughts, and growth path has impacted me more than I can say in one review (and yet I have completely felt the guilt of not writing a review yet‚Äî it worked). Thank you Antonia, thank you Joel. Your willingness to share your relationship and humanness with me and many others has (no hyperbole here) changed my life at a pivotal season.
Ps‚Äî we weirdo women SERIOUSLY want Antonia to expand in leadership roles as she has mentioned in the past... You know, just to push back some of the guilt. :P pretty please?"
212,Personality Hacker Podcast,You 2 R my Favorite Podcasters üß†üíïüññüèæüëçüèæüí°,5,"I‚Äôve listened to everyone of your podcast so far.
Your ability to gracefully articulate such diverse aspects of self profoundly inspire me with each time hear you each speak!
A very humbled INFP üë£üèÉüèæ‚òÄÔ∏èüçë"
213,Personality Hacker Podcast,üëçüëç,4,"Joel and Antonia provide a non-judgmental space to explore cognitive functions and differences in behavior. Some episodes are only tangentially related to MBTI types, but the relevant episodes are insightful."
214,Personality Hacker Podcast,Revolutionary mavericks on fire,5,Since discovering PH in 2015 I have consumed nearly every episode. I bought and got a lot out of the infx program and own that resource to apply more completely at my own leisurely convenience. PH keeps me looking at things from a new perspective and challenging me to rise to my potential. Thanks so much Toni and Joel!
215,Personality Hacker Podcast,Fantastic,5,"Incredible show, great explanation of ENFJ...it all makes sense now!"
216,Personality Hacker Podcast,Literally Changed My Entire Life Trajectory,5,"I will never be able to properly convey what this podcast has done for me. I had never even heard of Myers-Briggs until a coworker told me to go take the test. Once I did, I stumbled upon this podcast by chance and it shifted absolutely everything about my life. I was not in a good place and honestly, never really had been. And it was just getting worse and worse and I now shudder to think about where I would be today - almost exactly a year later - had I not come across Joel and Antonia and PH. I‚Äôm not exaggerating in any way, shape, or form when I say that you guys probably saved my life. By helping me understand WHY we all do the things we do and WHY I‚Äôve always felt like I just don‚Äôt belong here and how to better understand not only myself, but also the people I love, you have given me so much. I will never be able to return what you have done for me and my gratitude is inexplicable. I have since started from the very beginning and listened to every single podcast you‚Äôve made. You are changing the world. You are impacting people‚Äôs lives in ways you‚Äôll never know. Thank you from the very depths of my heart."
217,Personality Hacker Podcast,Called me out,5,"It is slightly ridiculous that I have been listening to you guys for so long, purchased packages, and even attended the most recent live event without leaving a comment. Thanks for putting out content and allowing me to begin the day with a friendly voice ;)"
218,Personality Hacker Podcast,Doing your part to save the world is IMPORTANT,1,"I stopped listening to this podcast after ep# 250 when Joel dismissed the awareness that his friend was trying to bring around the racist slogan . Social media can be a time drain but it can ALSO help mobilize people for good and has shed light on everyday racism that POC in the US deal with. A lot of this episode just showed Joel‚Äôs disconnect and his privilege. But then again as they‚Äôve said, maybe I‚Äôm just in my Millennial feelings."
219,Personality Hacker Podcast,Been following for years,5,"I have been following PH‚Äôs content for the past 6 years or so. Their car-model approach has helped me immensely to understand the Meyers-Briggs personality system, and their podcast is a wonderful resource to let my Ne and Fi (Extroverted Intuition and Introverted Feeling - I am an ENFP) run wild. They have given me great insight on myself and my friends and family, and helped me have a model for me to understand myself and those around me. They have a cadence which is enthralling to listen to - I truly feel like I know Joel and Antonia as friends! I wish I did. üòÜ Thanks PH team for bringing wonderful personality development content to the world!"
220,Personality Hacker Podcast,Wow,5,"I wasn‚Äôt expecting my type to fit almost spot on!! It has given me validation that I don‚Äôt get externally (INFP), I thought that I just felt emotions differently than ‚Äònormal‚Äô ppl feel them... it‚Äôs comforting to know that others feel like I do! Thank you, thank you! This is so awesome... thank you for teaching me"
221,Personality Hacker Podcast,Favorite Podcast,5,"The podcast that got me addicted to podcasts. As an INFJ, I‚Äôve never heard someone describe the process of Introverted Intuition so well. It‚Äôs like you guys sucked the thoughts out of my head and painted a picture with it. It‚Äôs a great reference point to help me explain myself. I love how you both value every cognitive function and explain the positives of every type of feeler/thinker. The one thing I wish you would mention about Extraverted Feelers is how they can be empaths and actually feel the emotions of others. I would love a podcast about that and how it can be managed. Keep up the great work!! üòä"
222,Personality Hacker Podcast,Essential for life,5,"The podcast is the gift that keeps on giving. The way Antonia and Joel explain and give reason is so explicit and thorough this podcast has allowed me to put words and perspective to an onslaught of blame and scapegoating. I can‚Äôt wait to purchase the kit.

223,Personality Hacker Podcast,Eye opening!!!,5,Keep up the good work. INFJ
224,Personality Hacker Podcast,Great find!,5,I‚Äôm so glad I found this podcast! Now I know a lot about why I am the way I am.
225,Personality Hacker Podcast,Thank You,5,"Personality Hacker People,
Thank you so much for your recent November 3rd 2019 (podcast #303) on INFX‚Äôs. I am an INFJ male and have always felt so different than everyone else. It turns out that I‚Äôm similar to other INFX‚Äôs. Especially other INFJ‚Äôs...
I‚Äôve gone through a big transformation in the past year. Giving myself permission to slow down and take care of my inferior Se (messages, mindfulness, noticing the beauty of nature, etc.) has truly unlocked my potential in no uncertain terms.
Interestingly, allowing myself to validate my anger has helped me as well... There are some people who just don‚Äôt get to be in my life and that‚Äôs ok... Especially people that feel that I need to change to be more like them...
I am who I want to be. And who I am is the rarest male MBTI type. Of course I‚Äôm different... In order for me to be who I am I have to be different... statistically speaking, male INFJ‚Äôs are the most different male type... Trying to make me like everyone else is a bad plan. I‚Äôm not like everyone else.
I‚Äôm allowing myself to do these things for the first time while developing the most important relationships that I have with my family and true friends. I‚Äôm trying not to ‚ÄúINFJ door slam‚Äù everyone... But what actually happened was that I basically cut everyone out and then let the right people back in...
I‚Äôm still letting people back in... slowly and intentionally using my Ni to guide me... Some people aren‚Äôt allowed back in... This is sort of what self care has looked like in the past year... Now I‚Äôm better at preventing slams from happening in the future.
I had to cut everyone to get to this place though. It involved quitting my corporate job, becoming self employed, a couple of moves, and a whole lot of much needed alone time to sort things out... (Not to mention fighting off the people that kept trying to fight to get back in.)
I seem to be sustainably happier than I‚Äôve ever been... I‚Äôm so glad that I‚Äôve gone through this important yet gut wrenching experience. I‚Äôm still going through it but the storm seems to have passed.
The anger is fading too... which is important for the world because I was REALLY angry! Angry, vengeful male INFJ‚Äôs are dangerous. Big time dangerous. We owe it to the world to take care of ourselves... Wow this review has taken an interesting turn... I‚Äôm trying to be more like Ghandi, Jesus Christ, and Christian Bale‚Äôs Batman and less like Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, and Batman‚Äôs nemesis the joker (all supposedly INFJ). Assertive male INFJ‚Äôs live at the extremes to say the least... I‚Äôve had to embrace this just to live my life each day. Embracing the truth and dealing with it rather than running from it has been key.
I‚Äôve debated whether or not to leave the last paragraph in this review but I think it needs to stay. I hope this review is helpful to you guys. Your work has been helpful to me even though I‚Äôm a new listener.
Thank you... Thank you so, so much.
With love,
Your assertive INFJ male friend on the mend."
226,Personality Hacker Podcast,The podcast I didn‚Äôt know I needed!,5,They cover so many topics that I was unconsciously dealing with but didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about. Listening to them put words to personal struggles and share resources and intelligent conversation around growth in all areas is helpful and I‚Äôm so grateful I found them! Thanks Joel and Antonia!
227,Personality Hacker Podcast,Wow!,5,"This podcast helped me understand my INFJ response to time. It is hard for me to understand how one can pull off an entire Thanksgiving meal, yet a particular guest is an hour late (with the mashed potatoes...) every year. It feels inconsiderate and dismissive. A wise friend asked me if several of the procrastinators in my family were optimists; they are! They tend to overestimate their abilities or underestimate the probability of a snag in the plan. I would be the pessimist who assumes numerous versions of said snag.
I also relate to Charis's aha moment regarding her quiet reflection vs. the extrovert's exuberant enjoyment of a beautiful scene. So helpful.
I chuckled at the knocking down a wall before the holidays. I have lived this for 29 years. I have actually been able to use the mess to my advantage. It can cover a multitude of sins or dust bunnies and get me out of an unwanted imposition. Take heart singles it is survivable. Hang on and enjoy the ride!"
228,Personality Hacker Podcast,Peerless Podcasters!,5,"Joel and Antonia are the most incredible human beings I have yet to meet. Week in and week out, they provide us with a monumental amount of value, knowledge, expertise, experiences, ideas, thoughts, and nuances that forever remains ad rem and challenges us (for the greater good) in reflecting and digging deep into ourselves whilst communicating it with the rest of the world (not only within our community). It is an absolute delight to listen to them and learn, think, do and grow as a result of it. I love you both! Never stop podcasting! And I will LISTEN to you on the next Personality Hacker podcast!"
229,Personality Hacker Podcast,Conversation worth something,5,Antonia is amazing for always putting herself out there and going deep and personal to help others and Joel brings great concepts and is a great ‚Äòtranslator‚Äô for Antonia. Meaning he always knows how to re-phrase to bring it home for everyone. Their story is inspirational and their work is life saving. Get on that freedom train to be you! #PHtrain #INFJ
230,Personality Hacker Podcast,So helpful!,5,"This podcast has been so insightful and helpful to me- giving me insight into why I do things the way I do, and even more helpful information on how to grow as a person!"
231,Personality Hacker Podcast,Great Podcast about knowing yourself better,5,I listened to the ENFJ podcast and it was spot on. I‚Äôm looking to grow and move myself and my business to the next level and see the recommendations very helpful. Things that I do and have done for years were explained in detail. Powerful information.
232,Personality Hacker Podcast,Cognitive functions and time,5,"I am a long time listener, off and on. I just started up again a few weeks ago and have really enjoyed the latests podcasts. Please do more like the one on cognitive functions and time. For the really abstract topics, maybe think about bringing in an introverted intuitive to really show off everything intuitive conversations have to offer the world. Thanks for all of your work and for sharing your thoughts and insights with us."
233,Personality Hacker Podcast,INFP ‚Äúthe sensitive one‚Äù,5,"After a few major life changes I started looking into personality characteristics. I‚Äôve taken the Myers Briggs 4 different times in my life & always get the same result INFP. I‚Äôve come to peace with the fact that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúfeeler‚Äù. Your podcast has given further insight into why I do the things I do. Ive been living in my ‚Äúsafe‚Äù 10yr old zone for years. I‚Äôve gotten better at channeling my 3yr old, and being more of my authentic, adventure seeking natural self. I can‚Äôt thank you enough üòä. Keep doing what you do!

INFP has a built in creative drive to make things work given the freedom to do so. Thoughts on scheduling:
Kids: 1) Make your bed, brush your teeth & get dressed
2) Practice, practice makes better
3) Consistency creates security in kids & adults
4) Allowing kids to figure it out while guiding them creates a sense of independence
5) Setting an alarm
6) Make your lunch/snacks the night before
7) Honesty about schedule you desire
8) Prepare clothes & materials the night before
9) Find the shortest route
10) Leave early if possible
11) Recognize the decrease in stress with having some things scheduled
12) Seek employers who genuinely care about your desired schedule & will work with you
13) Laying a somewhat scheduled foundation for kids (especially creative types) will help them when they get older.
14) Schedules provide a sense of security, safety & predictability
15) Know yourself, if you have an adventurous/creative side have days/times where you can do those things as well otherwise you‚Äôll go Bonkers
16) Give yourself a treat for doing what may not come natural
17) recognize your sense of accomplishment
18) Job shop until you find what works for you-remember you‚Äôre the one they want. If they don‚Äôt see it that way someone else will
19) If your life situation changes be open & honest with employers about what you need.
20) Last never least just keep on rolling, eventually something‚Äôs gotta give üòõ

234,Personality Hacker Podcast,Drop the mic,5,"I Googled upon this site when reassessing MB. I typed decades ago, and wondered if I was mistaken. I read a blog by Antonia, then linked to PH Podcast. Antonia and Joel's podcasts have both breadth and depth - the latter usually lacking in most online material. I appreciate how thorough, insightful and practical the discussions are, and enjoy how well they compliment each other's style. Very glad I found the podcasts!"
235,Dishing Up Nutrition,Love it,5,I really like this podcast and I find it so helpful. Some supplements and vitamins I‚Äôm interested in and I wonder if there are show notes because I forget so quick.
236,Dishing Up Nutrition,Mental health and diet,5,"Found their podcast searching for tips for supporting mental health with diet. Easy to understand, uncomplicated advice."
237,Dishing Up Nutrition,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"The host of the Dishing Up Nutrition podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
238,Dishing Up Nutrition,My absolute favorite podcast!,5,"I love listening to y‚Äôall every morning! Is there any way you can talk more about easy meal ideas for busy moms? I work 8-5pm, pick up the kids, rush home to put dinner on the table and this isn‚Äôt including nights we need to be at the baseball field until 9pm. Would love to hear more easy meal tips from y‚Äôall!"
239,Dishing Up Nutrition,Got my period back thanks to you!,5,I can‚Äôt recommend this podcast enough! I was diagnosed with hypothalamic amenorrhea largely I think due to eating too little fats doing WW after my last baby. I got down to a great size but my period disappeared. In one of your podcasts you mentioned eating 5-6 tablespoons a day. Im convinced making sure I do this consistently brought it back Saturday night. I can‚Äôt thank you enough for your wise counsel!
240,Dishing Up Nutrition,Episode 84,4,"Great information on nutrition and estrogen. It should be noted that a recent study shows that endometriosis is not always an estrogen responsive disease. Lesions can have receptors responsive to estrogen, progesterone, both, or neither. So focusing diet completely based off estrogen is not comprehensive. In fact sometimes phytoestrogens can help with symptoms of endometriosis. Also this podcast talks about being overweight or obese a lot. Endometriosis actually tends to show up more in fit or underweight patients! No cutting out carbs can actually be harmful for some. Healthy carbs are often a must in endometriosis patients! I really suggest listen to EndoArmy‚Äôs endometriosis and nutrition podcast too if you have endometriosis as well in addition to this great information!"
241,Dishing Up Nutrition,Information with results,5,Wonder information explained in an easy to understand manor you can bring to your life. Knowledge is power that brings good results.
242,Dishing Up Nutrition,Good podcast but some of the info is questionable,3,"I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and I stumbled upon your episode ‚Äúmanaging diabetes‚Äù... you make a few statements that were a little off. First, diabetes is not solely caused by ‚Äúwhat you put in your mouth‚Äù. Type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes vary drastically in their pathophysiology from type 2 diabetes. A second point I wanted to mention regarding this episode - you mentioned that the ‚Äústandard diabetic diet does work‚Äù, and that people are being advised to eat 60g of carbs per meal and focus on a low fat diet (who is giving this advice?!). After doing so much research and receiving LOTS of diabetic education, NONE of my healthcare providers or nutritionists have recommended anything of the sort. They recommend a steady, controlled source of unprocessed carbohydrates from clean sources. 30g per meal and 15-20g carbs per snack, higher fat and higher protein foods as well. My post-prandial sugars have been tightly controlled in the 75-95 range using this advice. Reading the ADA or Mayo Clinic recommendations for diabetic education for example, directly contradicts this notion you guys mentioned of ‚Äúlow fat diets being recommended to diabetics‚Äù. I‚Äôm just curious if you could clarify some of this information as it seems to be a bit misleading. I am also a critical care nurse and I have NEVER educated my diabetic patients to follow low fat diets. Also- perhaps a little more background info on what causes diabetes with a more well-rounded source of info would be great, not just stating ‚Äúit‚Äôs what you put in your mouth‚Äù. I eat a balanced, healthy diet and am not overweight and have very few risk factors for gestational diabetes other than being mixed race (African American) and being over the age of 25 (I‚Äôm 26). Please focus on distributing accurate and true information for your listeners who are in search of education and information to improve their lifestyles, and not just ‚Äúit‚Äôs what you put in your mouth, and people don‚Äôt want to hear that‚Äù... I am an ICU nurse and I am all for tough love when my patients aren‚Äôt managing their disease processes in a healthy way, but a little sensitivity and real information goes a long way."
243,Dishing Up Nutrition,My favorite health podcast,5,"Reliable, well cited information presented in an easily digestible way. Love how detailed discussions are and the science involved with each topic."
244,Dishing Up Nutrition,Please stop saying ‚Äúmmmh mmmh‚Äù after everything is quite annoying!,2,Stop it
245,Dishing Up Nutrition,no thanks!,1,"these ""experts"" are so clearly selling their products (and claiming proof for endless unproved claims), that NOTHING they say can be believed. SO much of nutrition is still unknown, that REAL scientists would examine/report more than one side of many controversial questions. That plus the CONSTANT SHILLING of their products makes this a shameless infomercial. LISTENER BEWARE!!!"
246,Dishing Up Nutrition,Indescribably helpful,5,Listening to this podcast helped start my wellness journey. I love that they want to help naturally with food and not automatically calling for prescriptions to mask a problem. The nutritionists and dietitians explain why they recommend what they do. It's information that we can take and decide for ourselves if it fits our beliefs. I highly recommend this podcast to everyone.
247,Dishing Up Nutrition,Rarely one listen,5,I‚Äôve been listening to the Dishing Up Nutrition podcast for over 5 years and I can count on one hand the number of times I‚Äôve listened to an episode only once. The information presented is clear and easy to understand. I love the explanations of our biochemistry and the principles of eating clean for vibrant health. I have my favorite episodes saved so that if I have a slip up I can recalibrate and remember core principles. I would love to see a few mini- episodes; when I send an episode to friends to sample they look at the 45 minutes and freak out-having no idea how the time will fly by! Some 8 or 10 minute core-truth mini-podcasts would go a long way (why does excess sugar cause BELLY fat? How does gluten cause inflammation? Why eat fat? Do I really need that much sleep?) Thank you for producing such a wonderful show. üåªES
248,Dishing Up Nutrition,Excellent podcast!,5,"I‚Äôm from Indianapolis so I choose to listen to the show via the podcast. I love the show! I have been listening for about 3-4 Years and it has definitely changed the way I look at food. It has changed my lifestyle in a great way. I have a 7 month old and I love being able to integrate healthy solid foods into her diet. I have learned so much and continue to learn each week! I love the chocolate dynamic greens- I add it to my protein shake every morning. Thank you, Nutritional Weight and Wellness!
Paige, 31, Indianapolis"
249,Dishing Up Nutrition,Great nutrition podcast,5,Love the podcast. The advice is spot on! I listen for continued encouragement to eat for a better and healthier life!
250,Dishing Up Nutrition,New Learnings each week !!,5,Outstanding podcast. With all the noise around good nutrition today here are two smart dietitians you can trust. Every week I learn something new that I can apply to improve my meal planning and my family‚Äôs nutrition.
251,Dishing Up Nutrition,Best Public Service!,5,"My absolute favorite podcast on nutrition, long time listener. Eating the NWW way has nearly reversed the peripheral neuropathy I had of both feet. On program for 14 weeks, I‚Äôve not only recovered sensation in my feet, but lost 14 lbs, improved my triglycerides by 10 points and I‚Äôm not ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù but I‚Äôm working on it. As a retired RN, I am strong believer in their message, can‚Äôt thank them enough. A truly wonderful public service, not to be missed."
252,Dishing Up Nutrition,Unexpected result,5,"I started listening to this podcast on a whim, started to actually eat the way they tell you and in 6 months lost 26 pounds. Needless to say, I‚Äôm hooked and have changed my life. Love it!"
253,Dishing Up Nutrition,Tremendously Helpful,5,"I am so happy I found this podcast! It has enabled me to improve my energy levels, digestion, and allergies. And both times my husband and I started trying for children, we conceived within 2 months. It is absolutely amazing the the health issues our family has been able to resolve (and probably avoid) with good nutrition! Give it a listen- once you get over the cheesy music and commercials, the information is truly empowering!"
254,Dishing Up Nutrition,Life changing!,5,This is by far my absolute favorite podcast! Finally I can binge on something good for me...This podcast. Each episode is packed with so much information that I will listen to the same episode over and over just so I don‚Äôt miss anything. Even if the topic is about something I may not be facing I still get an education. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say this show is life changing. The education I receive by listening to this podcast is so valuable to me and my family it ranks up there pretty closely to my religious faithüôÇ
255,Dishing Up Nutrition,Nutritional Weight and Wellness,5,"Ive been listening to NWW‚Äôs informative podcasts for over 10 years! Listen to learn how to eat real foods in balance. Look and feel your very best by eating real food. Working with their nutritionists, I‚Äôve lost 55lbs since March of 2018 by eating real foods. Give it a try! You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
256,Dishing Up Nutrition,So True and so Energizing,5,"Wow, well this will stop you in your tracks! When you grab for the cookie you are adding a wrinkle to your face. :) I greatly appreciate the honest facts this show dishes up. In the moment we might think a certain choice will make us 'beautiful' however we need to be very conscious about how it will impact our inner and outer health in the long run. This show touched on a hot topic: Helping Your Skin Age Gracefully and I appreciated how informative they were on this topic. Thank you!"
257,Dishing Up Nutrition,Too much advertising!,2,"When I first started listening to this podcast, I appreciated the information and advice about eating whole foods , adding in healthy fats etc. Unfortunately as I listen to more and more podcasts the nutritionists say the same few things over and over again, and the majority of their content is advertising and self promotion for ‚Äúnutritional weight and wellness‚Äù. They constantly push the idea of their classes and making appointments with their nutritionists; in point of fact they almost go so far as to say you are not going to succeed unless you have that kind of support. More original content would be appreciated, as would more rigorous fact checking when pushing certain supplements, etc. Dr. Mark Hyman‚Äôs podcast ‚ÄúFarmacy‚Äù is far more informative and educational."
258,Dishing Up Nutrition,Redundant,2,"I am a Nutritional Weight and Wellness customer and listener. I purchase supplements and have received counseling sessions from a nutritionist. I listen to the podcast quite frequently, but wish the nutritionists would go into more of the technical information (e.g. what is mitochondrion, how does it heal, etc.). I understand the desire to keep the information high level for new listeners, but it‚Äôs a bit redundant and less engaging for longtime listeners. I would like to understand the science a bit more. Please go into the technical info a bit more. A good example would include the episode with your guest Dr. Bob Rakowski."
259,Dishing Up Nutrition,Recommend to my patients all the time!,5,"Excellent, research based nutritional advice and practical ideas. Each episode is focused on one topic of health but they all follow the same basic eating plan. These dieticians and nutritionists are helping people all over the world eat real foods, healthy fats and skipping the processed junk and sugar. I have been listening for the past 9 years and have easily maintained a healthy weight through 4 pregnancies following this advice. Unlike years prior where I was always ‚Äúdieting‚Äù, now I eat lots of fats, meats, vegetables and some fruit. I‚Äôm an Emergency Room RN and frequently recommend this podcast to my patients who are looking for nutritional advice on various topics. Thank you and keep up the good work!"
260,Dishing Up Nutrition,Great show. One minor flaw.,4,"Great informative show; however, it would be nice if there was more of a focus on just the nutritional information and less on callers who seem to detract from the program."
261,Dishing Up Nutrition,Wonderful and insightful,5,"I love this podcast. It is wonderful. I can tell that the hosts are so passionate about nutrition, real food eating and helping people change the behaviors that lead them to obesity. I especially like the fact that they don't blame the victim. After listening to this podcast for a week, I‚Äôm convinced that obesity is a chronic medical issue stemming from many factors such as genetics, biochemistry, behaviors and too many processed foods. Just that little tidbit of information alone has given me permission to give myself a break and stop hating myself for being overweight. Thank you."
262,Dishing Up Nutrition,Mistakes,1,they make a lot of claims that i can‚Äôt find any research to support. make sure you check their facts before you change your diet.
263,Dishing Up Nutrition,My absolute favorite podcast.,5,"I heard about this podcast from a coworker about 4 months ago & have gradually been listening more and more, now almost daily! I just can‚Äôt get enough.
So much good information on a very wide variety of topics. Who knew how much nutrition affected? Hair loss, wrinkles, etc. And who knew how much could be FIXED with good nutrition! This is a weekly podcast, so by now, I‚Äôm down to the older episodes from the early 2010s and the message has been the same the whole time. Consistent. All still relevant. Some topics repeated, but with years in between and new studies included or just simply new perspectives which keep it interesting. The hard thing about nutrition (and nutrition podcasts) is all the misinformation we‚Äôve been fed throughout the years. And people nowadays want to have the quick fix to solve all your health and weight problems. That‚Äôs why I love Dishing Up Nutrition. I love the speakers and feel like I can really trust them. They cite their research, they interview other experts in the field, they pick through all the Mumbo-jumbo fake news about nutrition and give you the supported & proven evidence. They are a BUSINESS, yet giving all this information out for free. You can tell that they are truly in this profession to help people and are believers in the Nutritional Weight and Wellness way of eating because they have seen the results on the day to day with their clients. Thank you ladies for doing this; please continue as long as possible. Will always recommend."
264,Dishing Up Nutrition,One of my favorite podcasts,4,Very good information!!
265,ADHD Experts Podcast,Helpful,5,"I prefer adult information, but it‚Äôs all good. I really appreciate your hard work to bring us this podcast."
266,ADHD Experts Podcast,I really needed this,4,"I don‚Äôt know how I got signed up for e- mails from you as not being computer literate I could have clicked on something that sent somehow me this place.
I am 67 years old and didn‚Äôt know I had ADD until I was 50! The only reason then was,I was teaching
7th-12th grade English classes at a Christian school, and one of my 7th grade students mother( who also taught at this school), gave me a paperback book about what her son suffered with and the reason he may be falling asleep due to his ADD medicine. I admit I was a very strict teacher as I knew some of my students had were slow learners and needed to be able to concentrate in order to understand anything I was teaching them. I kept the classroom quiet( unlike other teachers there) and classes were very structured.
So when I came to the last page of the ADD book it asked the question: do you know anyone else who has most of the below symptoms.
To my SHOCK I checked every single box! I always knew there was something different going on in my mind (like riding a carousel around and around unable to ever get off).
So I self diagnosed myself in 1998 with this syndrome I had NEVER heard of. And living in a little coal mining town their doctors had never even heard of Adult ADD. I worked in child protective services after teaching in WV so other than reading that book I had quite a few children clients who saw a psychiatrist or psychologist for ADHD. Life happenings caused me to have to change jobs, and move to two different states ( one after the other). Still in my present state I live in, wasn‚Äôt until 20010 that I was able to connect with a doctor who worked with ADD adults. I just had too much on my plate between the realization of my ADD and the actual ability to see that specific doctor. So from 1998-20010 I survived in my chaotic world somehow. I have been taking Focalin XR 30 mg. But will be changing to Mydayis as soon as I can get an appointment( during the coronavirus situation now).
I enjoyed your podcast it said April 8 but the email said it would be a live podcast on April 9, at 1:00 EDT.
Finally your app, podcasts are giving me a sense of community and understanding I never had before."
267,ADHD Experts Podcast,Insanely relatable,4,"As I‚Äôm sure is a common experience among many women, I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed until well into adulthood and just can‚Äôt believe how much all of this went unnoticed. At the same time, I can‚Äôt believe how well studied it is! It is comforting to know so much research has been conducted in the area of ADHD and that so many stunning scientists are working so hard to understand inattention and hyperactivity to help those of us who experience it. I do find it funny that so many reviews focus on the sound quality aspect of this podcast, as I‚Äôm sure a podcast with a comparable issue for a neurotypical population wouldn‚Äôt have half the complaints. To that end, I think it would be fascinating to do an episode on the relationship between distractibility and sensory sensitivity, as there seems to be a nontrivial relationship between ADHD and other sensitivty-based obstacles like misophonia. Can‚Äôt wait to keep listening and learning about myself, my family, and my students!"
268,ADHD Experts Podcast,Full of Knowledge!,5,This podcast is amazing! I have learned so much about research and strategies to help my son now that we‚Äôre on our own ADHD journey. And it‚Äôs so accessible! Thank you for taking the time to provide this awesome free resource for parents and teachers to gain knowledge from experts!
269,ADHD Experts Podcast,ADDitude Mag = Life Saver,5,This has been a game changer for me. As an adult it is nice to know I‚Äôm not just a flake. Help tools - sharing struggles - celebrating successes. I suggest this to my ADD/ADHD and Non-ADD/ADHD friends
270,ADHD Experts Podcast,"Great content, hard to hear",3,"Very knowledgeable guest! Great content, I was taking notes. Unfortunately the audio is not smooth, it‚Äôs choppy and skips words. I see the disclaimer now, but yeah, it‚Äôs two very professional people talking so it seems they deserve a better recording."
271,ADHD Experts Podcast,Seriously fix the audio already.,2,If every single crime pod can manage to figure out wonderful sound that doesn‚Äôt make me want to pull my ears off.... Why is it that after 6 years you can‚Äôt? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
272,ADHD Experts Podcast,Background noises,3,"Love the content, very thorough. Can‚Äôt hardly make it through an episode secondary to the background noise. It sounds like the host marking papers with a highlighter or sharpie? Feels like nails on a chalkboard. Please address!!"
273,ADHD Experts Podcast,Great resource for teachers!,5,"This podcast is a great listen for teachers who are looking to learn more about students with ADHD. I found it helpful to hear the experts discuss practical strategies for the classroom. There are many tips, as well as stories from experience, to help provide a more safe and productive learning environment for all students."
274,ADHD Experts Podcast,Helpful,4,Great information for teachers and parents. Many easy to implement helpful strategies for children withADHD as well as their typical peers.
275,ADHD Experts Podcast,Such a great resource,5,"Lecture style information is straight from their webinar series. A little sacrifice in audio quality, but not a problem in the context of the webinar style recording. Great for those who can‚Äôt invest in regular webinar attendance. Scholarly and useful information for a wide range of listeners."
276,ADHD Experts Podcast,Very helpful!!,5,Really appreciate all the incredible information and support from specialists. It is wonderful to hear that you are not alone out there and many others are dealing with similar issues. Feeling very grateful! Thank you!!
277,ADHD Experts Podcast,Bad Audio - Webinar Replay,5,"Ignore the audio (they‚Äôre replays of webinars), the content is key."
278,ADHD Experts Podcast,Useful,5,Useful advice from unique perspectives. Any educator can benefit from listening
279,ADHD Experts Podcast,Not super impressed,2,"Listened to the episode on alternative therapies and unless you‚Äôve been living under a rock, there‚Äôs nothing new here expect the brief mention of beta waves and a few programs that (of course) insurance won‚Äôt cover that almost no one can afford."
280,ADHD Experts Podcast,"Audio quality- please, please, please!",5,"There is likely great information in these podcasts but I‚Äôll never know. The audio quality is so poor I can‚Äôt listen. To everyone who has a podcast, consider the medium with which you are spreading your message. Invest in a good microphone. It makes your podcast sound professional and legitimate."
281,ADHD Experts Podcast,Excellent Information!!,4,"ANY question I have on ANY ADHD topic, I can find info here. I would‚Äôve done 5 stars but audio can be quite tinny and not great. That being said I‚Äôm still tuning in the community needs this info..... invaluable!"
282,ADHD Experts Podcast,Disappointing,1,"I wanted to continue listening but the audio made it so difficult. Also, as a special education teacher I had a hard time listening to this. Ya teachers care so deeply for our students always want is best. We are not lazy nor are we against parents. We are ALL on the same team and want what is best for the student."
283,ADHD Experts Podcast,Great info,5,Really useful information in digestible format. But really difficult to hear audio.
284,ADHD Experts Podcast,Really distracting audio quality.,4,Great content but as others have said the audio is pretty terrible. I‚Äôm finding it hard to listen to. Please invest in a decent microphone or find someone to help you get the technical side of recording a podcast figured out.
285,ADHD Experts Podcast,Thank you for existing! I‚Äôm putting everything I learn in practice üëç‚≠êÔ∏è,5,Love ALL your information NOW in podcast format! 100% recommended to parents.
286,ADHD Experts Podcast,How ADHD Shapes Your Perceptions,5,"Really good info from Dr. Dodson and especially on Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. Also learned that CBT addresses behavior but does not address the root cause of the feelings.
Others have mentioned the sound quality. I feel that the female interviewer‚Äôs voice is scratchy. Dr. Dodson sounded fine to me.
Highly recommend this Podcast."
287,ADHD Experts Podcast,Helpful series for parents & professionals,5,Episode 233 should be mandatory listening for every K12 Intervention Specialist in the states. Tons of great information.
288,ADHD Experts Podcast,Catching up,5,"This Podcast is really informative. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD( the inattentive variety.). I‚Äôm a woman in my late 30‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm learning a ton. Keep up the good work."
289,ADHD Experts Podcast,"Great info, insufferable sound quality",3,"The title says it all. Maybe it's just my ADD, but the sound quality makes it almost impossible to get through an episode. I really hope this gets fixed because I want very badly to listen.
What I mean by poor quality - the host sounds like she has a sore throat, and the call-in guests often sound distant, with a metallic echo - like when an MP3 has been saved at the lowest quality setting, and then saved again like that 3 or 4 more times.
I am not a sound-guy, but I listen to MANY podcasts, and all of them have somehow found a solution to these things. Again, I hope this gets resolved, because the information is really good."
290,ADHD Experts Podcast,She obviously doesn‚Äôt have ADHD,2,She acts like people with ADHD aren‚Äôt capable people. Really don‚Äôt right a todo list because we will feel bad if we can‚Äôt do everything on it.... are you serious right now? What about all the things we forget because we didn‚Äôt write it down???? Ridiculous! Also really I have ADHD so please don‚Äôt insult our way of thinking kind to say we can only do one silverware drawer at a time. So insulting!
291,ADHD Experts Podcast,Good!,4,"This is good information and interesting for a variety of audiences, not only ADHD ones. The thing that drives me crazy about this podcast is the moderator of the podcast always sounds like she‚Äôs calling in from the moon. It‚Äôs so frustrating! Come on.....it‚Äôs 2019....get the audio quality figured out!!"
292,ADHD Experts Podcast,Helpful,5,Always great information
293,ADHD Experts Podcast,Time for another podcast:),5,"Love this podcast, please keep it going. Audio quality could be better. The content is gold. Thank you!"
294,ADHD Experts Podcast,Why is the audio sped up???,3,"Very informative, wide range of subjects. But why does it sound like someone has their hands on the speed control, speeding it up, slowing it down. Totally aggravating"
295,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,You Have a Loyal Listener in Me,5,"Over It and On With It has been a part of my week for years now and an integral piece to my wellness and personal development. Christine has an uncanny ability to connect to the heart of any matter and relate her experiences and those of her clients in ways we can all learn from.

Along with being very practical & aplicable to my own life. Take to time to listen, feel what resonates with you, it can be surprising. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
298,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,My favorite self-help podcast!,5,"I usually don‚Äôt like the term self-help because I think it has a negative connotation, but this podcast is beautifully done and really helps people work through areas that are preventing them from being the best version of themselves. I love both the client calls and the coach‚Äôs corners. Christine is truly gifted and has a way of understanding people‚Äôs feelings and how they may react. I have learned and grown so much from all her experience and wisdom!"
299,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Inspiring and helpful!,5,"I absolutely love this podcast. The live coaching calls are wonderful to witness.

302,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Lost in Thought UNTIL NOW,5,I have been drifting along lost in thoughts swarming around my head and heart.

Thank You Christine for following your passion and listening to that still small voice inside and sharing it with the rest of us. I am constantly inspired to be a better person and to grow when listening to you and your guests. I LOVE THIS PODCAST. #PrepareToBeInspired
303,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Refreshed,5,I‚Äôve listened to about 5 episodes so far. I like how she listens to her guests and then ends with final thought to summarize and gives strategies to help. It‚Äôs nice to know there are others out there that share the same struggles as I. I‚Äôll definitely make it a daily practice to listen to more shows.
304,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Life Changing,5,I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about Christine and this podcast. She‚Äôs so real and I feel like I resonate with everything she talks about. Listening to this podcast has brought me so much awareness emotionally and spiritually.

305,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Angelic ~,5,"Thank you Christine for your beautiful light that you grace our world with. Your angelic voice soothes the soul and refreshes the spirit. I gave up my car for a year and have been walking 7 miles a day to get to and from work. With all the extra walking in a usual day, I probably put in 10 miles altogether in any given day. I‚Äôm 58 years young and I am blessed to share my journey with my amazing 15 year old daughter. We live in Mission Viejo, CA. Having so much time coming and going, I started listening to podcasts which is how I came across yours. So much food for thought, mental exercising, and thoughtful intentions. I‚Äôm stronger, wiser, and more self compassionate. I have always been a force to be reckoned with, I‚Äôm just now believing that this special force is my super power. Now is my hope to meet my twin flame. I‚Äôm trusting that he is looking for me as I am him. You spoke of a new FB group you wanted to create, I believe it to be different than what is already in place. I would love to know more about this. Thank you again for your kindness and special wisdom, your light does not go unnoticed.......warm regards, Lanie"

313,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Call... Change... Create,5,"Dear Listener,
Reading this review could mean many different things:
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre on the fence about listening to Christine‚Äôs podcast
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôve come to a point in life where something needs to shift but some nagging resistence is stopping you from hitting play
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre reading reviews because you do your homework before investing time in listening to people‚Äôs problems
‚Ä¢ And, my personal favorite... Insert reason my POV doesn‚Äôt see
Let me be frank, We are all the caller being coached by Christine. My problems are not alone; everybody experiences suffering in some degree. ‚ÄúOver It and On With It‚Äù hits the bullseye with every caller and interview. This podcast teaches reflection, retrospection, and relation to the common humanity; let the shifts begin!!
So, reader, if you are on the fence, hear me now! Hitting play is the second step you take towards healing. The first was your curious desire to read about this podcast. Take the next step. That‚Äôs all we really need to focus on to ignite the healing waiting for us!
Love and light to All,
Katherine"

Witnessing how Christine really sees people, warms my heart, and inspires me to be fully present in my life. I not only find value in listening to the ideas, feedback, and tools Christine provides, listening to Christine‚Äôs podcast inspires me to fervently listen to the song of my own soul.
With immense gratitude,
Kara Stein-Conaway"
315,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Excellent podcast,5,I was coached on episode 218 of the podcast. The amount of compassion I felt from Christine was incredible. I highly recommended this podcast for anyone looking to grow into the best version of themselves.
316,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,This Podcast Is a Godsend!,5,I found this podcast about 4-5 months ago and it has made such a difference in my life. Christine‚Äôs genuine love and compassion is so refreshing and soothing. I can relate with many of the callers and I‚Äôm learning so much about why I do the things I do. My goal is to get into her mastery program and attend her retreat next year because I know they will both be life changing!
317,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Ebv,5,Oh my I hope this is the last of the piece of the issues I have thank you so much for this info it‚Äôs been difficult to find information on this online... love it!!!! Question how easily is this transferred over to family members and should everyone in the family have themselves checked? When it reactivates after going dormant is it contagious again? Thanks soo soo much!!
318,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,My tool box is growing,5,"I‚Äôve been on a journey lately to live in the present and worry less about the future. After stumbling across this podcast, I feel through these sessions that my toolbox is growing and my perspective is shifting! Highly recommend this podcast! It‚Äôs been a life charger for me!"
319,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,The best of the best,5,"I recommend this podcast to everyone who is doing the work and trying to make changes in their lives.

Christine is warm, skillful, and smart."
320,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,So powerful!!,5,"Christine's podcast is so powerful. There's something about being a fly on the wall for an in-depth, personal coaching session that just pulls at the heartstrings. Not only is Christine compassionate when working with the callers, but she provides effective and actionable tips for them. Her podcast is unique because of all of that, and I'm definitely sticking around!"
321,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Love Christines coaching style,5,"This podcast is so helpful! As a coach I use it as a resource to help me guide my clients back to their own inner light. Thank you Christine, you are so relatable and so loving and so helpful to everyone! I hope to learn from you in person someday!"
322,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Great podcast,4,Wonderful messages through some real life podcasts. My only criticism is that I don‚Äôt appreciate the in depth talk of health illnesses as I am a healthcare professional & some of the info related to health is incorrect. The messaging behind what Hassler is trying to communicate is fine but to talk about health issues & what happens to the body etc. is often inaccurate & takes away from the overall messaging. Take that aspect with a grain of salt and please consult a healthcare professional for actual biochemical health related issues.
323,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,Ep. 207 Break free of your fear of being seen with Teema.,5,"This was a very powerful episode for me..Thank you for sharing your Gifts with the world .. I also want to thank Teema for sharing her story..üòò
Donnaerobics"
324,Over it and On with it with Christine Hassler,I love this podcast!,5,I have been listening for about 6 months now and Christine never fails to blow my mind with how she goes right to the core issue behind each question. Her insights into what is behind some of the questions are amazing and I have had so many lightbulb moments for my own life that have helped me as I move forward in my journey. I can't get enough of this podcast!
325,ReWild Yourself,Incredible Podcast!!,5,This podcast makes me feel inspired -and- down to earth. I highly recommend listening to Daniel‚Äôs ‚ÄúWildFed‚Äù podcast as well!
326,ReWild Yourself,Claim your Sovereignty,5,"This podcast is absolutely filled with inspiring and empowering information to come into touch with your most optimized human nature. Daniel is a motivating individual that really practices what he preaches. The dialogue is a great balance between philosophical and practical. For those who want to expand their consciousness, reconnect to the wild self within and become a sovereign human being this podcast is just for you"
327,ReWild Yourself,WILD ideas!,5,This show presents some wild ideas. They resonate with me. I give it 5 stars!
328,ReWild Yourself,Thanks,5,Thank you for all of this
329,ReWild Yourself,Get to the point and stop the mindless chatter,1,Mostly a lot of meaningless chatter.
330,ReWild Yourself,Life changing (2019 update),5,"Daniel is phenomenal, his work is life changing. Rewild!
***re-listening in 2019; powerful ***"
331,ReWild Yourself,Relistening,5,I know I‚Äôve listened to almost all if these 2-3 years ago. I am learning so much more this second go around! Quality and enjoyment x 2
332,ReWild Yourself,Daniel Vitalis is an international treasure!,5,"How did Vitalis have a podcast for 2 years and I‚Äôm just finding out about it? I‚Äôve heard him speak dozens of times on other people‚Äôs podcasts on YouTube mostly. He‚Äôs bringing the common practices of people all over the world like drinking water from Springs, squatting when you go, eating wild foods, hunting and gathering and inspiring domesticated Americans to do the same, to their benefit. Most of all you will be educated on your magnificent body and how to maximize the use out of it. Our
Lifestyle is a breeding ground for diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. He‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in this modern world of pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, un-natural complete sun avoidance practices, drinking water from
Faucets which contain birth control and just plain ladened with toxins. This is better than any Netflix! Every human must hear this:) open your mind! Improve your health!"
333,ReWild Yourself,Armchair anthropology with no scientific basis,2,"I‚Äôve only listened to the first episode of this podcast, and it‚Äôs mostly paleo pseudoscience with some sexism, racism, and dangerous information thrown in.
In this episode, two men criticize women who give birth in hospitals because it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. I‚Äôm a former wildlife biologist and minored in biological anthropology, and from experience I know maternal and fetal death during the birthing process- even (especially) in the wild- occurs regularly. It‚Äôs a common, but inaccurate, assumption that natural selection results in a perfect organism that is successful in all biological processes. Pressuring women to give birth without medical supervision by claiming it is better for the child reeks of misogyny and can have devastating consequences. It is especially concerning when this comes from men, who have no business asserting authority over women‚Äôs bodies.
Later, they discuss how Africans are physically superior due to being ‚Äúundomesticated‚Äù. One even comments how he wishes he had a broad nose like an African because he‚Äôd be able to breath better. I‚Äôm not of African descent, but the discussion made me very uncomfortable. This is the same old ‚Äúwhite people are domesticated, brown people are primitive‚Äù racist trope, except now it‚Äôs OK to say because they claim white people should strive to be more like indigenous peoples.
Women again enter the discussion when the topic of breast cancer is brought up. They claim breast cancer can be prevented with diet. While there is clearly a link between diet and cancer, it‚Äôs ridiculous to blame women for cancer because they ate the wrong diet (and what is this magic diet? They never say). I have seen this type of thinking lead to eating disorders, especially among females, who obsess over the perfect diet that will prevent all disease, eat an extremely restricted diet, and end up in worse health due to the mental and physical toll. One of the guys even says breast cancer is like a book, and all you have to do is not read it. This is inaccurate and very offensive to those who have had breast cancer.
Towards the end, one guy makes a comment that people should not follow pediatricians‚Äô advice, and those who do so are ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù. For those of you with children- please listen to your doctor and not people online with no medical credentials. Don‚Äôt gamble with your kids‚Äô lives. I can not believe how they can casually give out this irresponsible advice.
There are many scientific and anthropological inaccuracies throughout the podcast which I won‚Äôt get into. My advice- get your biological and anthropological information from actual scientists, not from white guys who romanticize a particular period of time in human history."
334,ReWild Yourself,Not indicative of the rewilding movement,2,"Vitalis conducts Important Conversations with fascinating individuals doing great work; BUT, I find that his personality and perspective leave much to be desired. Many of his implied or stated beliefs, particularly his technophilia and his animosity towards leftist rewilders, lead me to question his motives. And let‚Äôs not mention his fondness for the infamous ethno-nationalist / eco-fascist Jack Donovan, who he will vehemently deny supporting despite recommending his books. Daniel‚Äôs guests, in general, have lots of valuable information to share. Just maybe take most of what he says with a grain of salt."
335,ReWild Yourself,Frustrating to listen to.,3,"Unfortunately I can't sing this podcast the praises that all of the other vitalis fans do. Time after time I begin an episode because I want to listen to the thoughts of an exciting guest and am constantly left frustrated by Daniel's lack of interviewing etiquette. This should be called the Daniel show with a side helping of guest input. Daniel is consistently interjecting to talk about himself. Not to mention the self promotion of his ""Surthrival"" line which is his product line featuring the same farmed products (colostrum/bone broth) which he so openly puts down in commentary. It's a bit confusing to hear an apparent ""die hard rewilder"" profiting from farmed products which he doesn't even produce himself. All in all, a great theory for a podcast with excellent guests and an egotistical host who needs some lessons on how to conduct an interview."
336,ReWild Yourself,Life changing,5,"I have been listenimng to these podcasts for over a year now ...I have learned so much of things that make perfct sense ...this is seriously deeply healthy information . Growing up in the country side of switzerland , I was lucky to eat from the garden . We preserved lots for the winter too . I never used to think how lucky I was . And I always loved to forage when possible ...but Daniel Vitals took this to the next level and really brings home how seperated our whole culture is from nature in so many ways ....these podcasts are so refreshing and libarating ...i want to shout out a huge YES and THANK YOU !"
337,ReWild Yourself,Changed my life for the better,5,"Daniel, thank you for doing what you do. I have been listening to your podcast for about a year and it has been nothing short of revolutionary. Guests like Katy Bowman, Nadine, Doniga, and Kimmy (in particular) have inspired me beyond belief."
338,ReWild Yourself,My favorite podcast,5,This podcast is spectacular. A comprehensive re-examining of our lifestyle with a clear and positive guideline for change.
339,ReWild Yourself,"Avoid this podcast, so disappointing",1,"Great information, very interesting! I was really loving it. However, after listening for a while, it is apparent that misogyny and white fragility are very present. Was hoping for so much more in terms of relating present issues with rewilding, deeply disappointing."
340,ReWild Yourself,Egotistical Beginner Masquerading as Expert,1,"Something always felt off when listening to this podcast. I was passionate about the topic, however, so I continued to listen. As time went on, I realized Vitalis is an egotistical sexist masquerading as an expert at all things he speaks of, most of which he is just learning about himself. His own pride and desire to be seen a certain way is evident to anyone who truly listens, and makes his podcast and any of his writings less credible and authentic. On top of this, his worldview comes from that of an isolated white man who believes he is a victim of racism since he holds many inherent privileges in his gender and race that others don't, even taking into account his difficult upbringing. Summary: his wildly sexist views and chest-beating ego overshadow any good that can come from his advice on connecting with nature and getting back to basics. There are many others you can go to instead as a source."
341,ReWild Yourself,Rewild yourself- listen up!,5,Explore these podcasts filled with loads of fascinating and intellectually poignant interviews! If you‚Äôre looking for interesting conversations filled with a dynamic array of guests then you‚Äôve found the right place. Thanks Daniel!!
342,ReWild Yourself,A real thoughtful podcast. I can't get enough,5,"Ancestral eating has become increasing popular, but so many other aspects of ancestral living getting very little discussion. This show has really challenged some of my perspective on a variety of facets of modern life. I have been called to question elements that I never realized were just more examples of being a domesticated human. Keep up the podcast! I really find it thought provoking."
343,ReWild Yourself,conducive to healthy growth,5,"Don't have itunes, borrowed friend's phone to leave this review because this podcast has changed my life in the most beautiful way. Thank you Daniel and team"
344,ReWild Yourself,Thank you Daniel - AMAZING SERIES,5,"I just found your podcasts about 6 months ago and have been feverishly listening to them. I have learned so many valuable things that I can use in many parts of my life! I'm sad to see this series end but look forward to hearing what you do next!
How long will these podcasts be available? I hope you will let us know if they will be going away!"
345,ReWild Yourself,Outstanding!,5,"I look forward to my drive home every day and to work so I can get a chance to listen to this station. I constantly am eager to learn new ways to better my life and my family‚Äôs life of living and this podcast constantly amazes me with things I never knew! I‚Äôve grown up in the woods and how important it is to live a healthy, clean life and listening to people that have the same passions I do is truly inspiring!"
346,ReWild Yourself,Expanding the experience of life,5,Great information to change your life for the better. I am now inspired to eat bugs and be naked outside. Thanks Daniel
347,ReWild Yourself,Part of the bright new story of humanity.,5,"Daniel Vitalis and a list of incredible guests bring the concept of ‚Äúrewilding‚Äù to life in a very thought provoking and enjoyable way. Ostensibly the wild food angle is the doorway in, but discussions about sexuality, philosophy, economics, and self-care fill out the picture of this primal vital way of being. I love that I can take concepts away from here to apply and practice in my own life. Though I doubt I‚Äôll ever go as deeply as this guy. Congrats on your recent marriage btw DV, you are an inspiration to my husband and me."
348,ReWild Yourself,Best podcast you could ever listen to!,5,"For sure one of the best podcast available! The information, guest, and Daniel himself can really change your life and lives of everyone you know for the better!"
349,ReWild Yourself,So very grateful,5,"Daniel is so amazingly knowledgable, honest, caring, curious, and genuine. I just discovered these podcasts and have been loving it. So so grateful that this is out there."
350,ReWild Yourself,Life Changing,5,"And I do not use the phrase lightly. Whether you agree with Daniel's views or not, the exposure to quality guests, thought provoking content, and an overall challenge to interact with one's environment in a way that promotes greater health is well worth the time and attention. I have been listening for a couple of years and I think I've heard all of the episodes, but was slow to get on my computer and review the show (sorry, Daniel). Despite that being a wrap on this incredible archive of discussion and transformation (for Daniel and I'm sure his listeners), it's well worth it to dig in and listen to all of the past episodes. If anyone is new to this show and looking for starting points, I would highly recommend anything with Arthur Haines‚Äîit's pure gold.
Thanks for your work and very much looking forward to the new, Wild-fed, project."
351,ReWild Yourself,Dive in NOW! Amazing information abounds.,5,"I discovered this show a few months ago, and every episode is reshaping the way I think about my body and the earth. Daniel has a nice voice and a very listenable style (for me), and his selection of guests is top-notch. This show is the care manual that I've always wished my body came with, and as a 29-year-old, I feel like I'm learning some of these things just in time. I am less afraid of aging now that I know most ailments come from stupid things we don't critically evaluate, like our shoes, glasses, posture, sleeping surfaces, sunscreen... jump in anywhere that sounds interesting and start making changes at your own pace to dramatically improve your wellbeing and connection with your body. Thanks Daniel, for this awesome show and for sharing your lifestyle with us."
352,ReWild Yourself,"Great podcast, thank you Daniel!",4,"At first I have to admit, I was turned off by Daniel's confidence (or overconfindnece), but the show grew on me. I will say that I would like to hear more vulnerability from Daniel, I want to know what he struggles with? What are his growing edges, fears, delimas. I have been struggling to live a life true to my passions and dreams for over a decade now. I am sold on the ideas presented here. What I long for is to hear real, true to life stories, I want to hear the gold and the shadows the solutions and the struggles. Thank you all for producing this awesome podcast!"
353,ReWild Yourself,Fantastic,5,"I just finished listening to every single episode of this podcast. To say that this podcast ""changed my life"" is clich√©, so let me be more specific. This podcast changed the way I brush my teeth, the way I shower, how I sleep, how I adjust the seat in my car, how I exercise, and how I do yard work. I would say that it changed the way I eat, but I was already on the wild food path. What I will say is that it has enhanced my knowldge of why wild foods are so important. This podcast, in my opinion, contains vital information on what it means to be a human animal, and how to be the best human that you can be."
354,ReWild Yourself,Blind spots are fascinating.,1,"This is a tough one. I have gained a lot from listening to some of these podcasts due to the guests but the interviewer is a fascinating yet very uncomfortable example of certain types of humans who truly believe they are awakened and yet have blind spots the size of the Grand Canyon. Much like Sam Harris kind of a classic clueless white dude with a big audience. One of the most telling examples is that Daniel uses an e collar(what folks who use e collars like to say) an e collar is a shock collar. He says he likes to think of it as texting his dog. Interesting when I get a text I don‚Äôt get an end truck shock. A very clear cognitive distortion of folks not able to see clearly. Also look into the allegations of sexual assault in his back ground. Eyes wide open, take what is useful leave the rest but let‚Äôs not gurusize people."
355,The Lavendaire Lifestyle,Lavendaire Content,5,All of the content Ailenee Xu puts out is great quality content that focuses on how to make your life better and get the most out of it. I love her YouTube channel and now her podcast!

The creative artists she has on as guests are all very inspiring. My favorite was Tj Lee and Karen Rosalie.

Each episode is filled with nuggets of wisdom and I‚Äôve found some of the best tools and resources on how to get motivated and create a meaningful life in my day-to-day. I am a multi-passionate creative type, just graduated with a Masters degree and was feeling unsure on how to make my next move - this podcast really helped me get out of my own way, embrace a ‚Äústart before you‚Äôre ready‚Äù attitude, and see a brightness within myself that I didn‚Äôt know was there.

401,Beauty Inside Out with Kimberly Snyder,Fabulous darling,5,"I first brought Kimberlys book in 2011 when I had my fourth child.

Love love love that you now have a podcast! So interesting-it‚Äôs definitely helping me get through these times, working from home and trying the contain my teenagers.

405,Beauty Inside Out with Kimberly Snyder,OK,3,"First of all, I love Kim‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Beauty Detox Solution‚Äù and it has really been life changing for me (sounds cliche but it‚Äôs true). However, I‚Äôm a little disappointed in this podcast. The content is for the most part decent, but I just cannot get past how commercialized this podcast is :( it‚Äôs hard for me to get behind a ‚Äúwellness‚Äù podcast that‚Äôs sponsored by gas station coffee, lol. Also I know I‚Äôm nitpicking, but the intro music is quite aggressive. Kim, I love your spirit and what you‚Äôre trying to achieve; I just think this podcast falls short of that."

I love all her tips, beauty (inner and outer), and her take on spirituality and holistic health. I have all her books! She reminds me of my best friend, and I feel like she is a kindred spirit! Love love love you Kim! Keep doing what you do. You make a difference!

414,Beauty Inside Out with Kimberly Snyder,Love!!,5,Love this podcast and all the information! So inspiring.
415,Sexy Marriage Radio,"Great information, not just for married people.",5,"My girlfriend and I have been listening to this podcast for a couple years now, and have even become paying patrons. It‚Äôs filled with great information on relationships and mental health, not just for married couples, but for anyone in a serious relationship. And although the hosts are Christian, most of the listeners are Christian, and there are hints of Christian themes, Dr. Corey Allen and his wife Pam are great at keeping the conversations informative and scientific rather than religious. I am no longer religious, but was raised Christian, so the Christian themes don‚Äôt bother me too much. But for anyone who might be bothered by Christian themes, I‚Äôd encourage you to look past those bits, because there‚Äôs still a lot of good information."
416,Sexy Marriage Radio,"light, pithy conversation, with intelligence",5,"These two are brilliant, lighthearted, and wonderful. I truly appreciate their work. Please continue to record because this is SORELY needed. Love this show!!!!
I used to think the fact that your wife is not a female clinician that it would detract from the analysis, yet that isnt really the case. As a Psychologist, sometimes I do want the nerdy psycho babble, but I can't turn the show off nonetheless! Great Job."
417,Sexy Marriage Radio,Awesome couple,5,Corey and Pam are such a genuine couple with great advice and in-site into everything marriage. We thoroughly enjoyed having them on our podcast.
418,Sexy Marriage Radio,Binge listener,5,I‚Äôm addicted to this show! Such great topics provided in a non-sleazy way. I wish I had this when I first got married!! I highly recommend.
419,Sexy Marriage Radio,Loved!,5,Inspiring! Inspiring! Inspiring!
420,Sexy Marriage Radio,Best Podcast,5,Thank you for being willing to talk about every aspect of sex. This pod past has given me and my wife the ability to talk about topics involving sexual that we would have never brought up before. This podcast answers so many questions for me as a Christian that is frankly aren‚Äôt talked about anywhere else. Thank you!!!
421,Sexy Marriage Radio,Not just for committed Christian couples,5,"99% of your advice is completely applicable to secular marriages. You aren't dogmatic when you give advice, but always state where you are coming from and provide room for different points of view. Keep up the excellent work."
422,Sexy Marriage Radio,Excellent material,5,Love this podcast and all of the content. So helpful for any married couples wanting to thrive in their sex life and even marriage.

425,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Found a new me!,5,"Im 22 yrs old and this podcast has helped me navigate my open relationship!!! Being non-monogamous has always been a keen interest of mine and this podcast helped me come out to my partner, and after a while, we decided to be non-mong. It has been so liberating!!! i havent stopped listening to don and dan since aug of last year. Thank u!!!<3"
426,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Great!,5,A terrific kink podcast!
427,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Rambling and Rambling...,1,"Where to begin...first maybe with bad sound. How about getting two decent microphones? Your listeners will thank you! Hmm, can these two ever manage to tell a story without getting themselves completely distracted? It‚Äôs mind numbing to try to follow along at times as they don‚Äôt know if they want to be sexy, be comedians, or just laugh at their own jokes nervously."
428,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Sound quality,1,Sound quality is horrible. It sounds like they‚Äôre recording in a big metal box. You would think after 450+ podcast they would have invested in some good recording equipment
429,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Sound quality,1,"Interesting material, but super horrible sound quality. Their cast is so tiny, invest in quality recording equipment"
430,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Somewhat disappointed,3,"I really like the premise of this podcast. The topics are fantastic and I really admire the hosts‚Äô enthusiasm about the BSDM lifestyle! However, my issue with the podcast is that I feel like I‚Äôm just eavesdropping on a conversation, not being informed of whatever the chosen topic is. It seems to take a long time to get into the subject and the female host‚Äôs giggling (while adorable) is distracting. Perhaps get to the topic sooner in each episode and stay focused."
431,Erotic Awakening Podcast,AWESOME!,5,"Dan and Dawn put together a great podcast. I love their interviews, tips and adventures. They don't just talk about the lifestyle, they live it."
432,Erotic Awakening Podcast,A real couple with real views,5,Very interesting and very real point of views. Never boring and love that they have opened themselves to teach all about sex and everything under that umbrella.
433,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Educational and fun,5,I always learn something new from two very down to earth genuine people. One of the few Male led M/s podcasts I‚Äôve found. Leaves me smiling every time
434,Erotic Awakening Podcast,Great listening for experienced or beginner!,5,Making my days fly. So glad someone posted on FetLife about them!

455,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,Hope for future,5,"Podcast on Chronic Pain, gave me simple tools to start mending what pain has now produced in a destructive menace in my brain. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù started 35 years ago with accident, breaking my pelvis in 3 places, which has never healed correctly nor has my body reflected the health I walked in, being a dance major. My pain levels are so intense and random in my body, that make no sense. I can‚Äôt imagine how this is deteriorating my brain due to my lack of memory, thought, and anxiety.
I started your 6 week Brain Health Revolution and sharing with those interested. I‚Äôve done the gamut of Drs, pain clinic, medicines, counselors, PT with side effects or no lasting help. I love that you‚Äôve made it simple, even though it‚Äôs so complex. With where my brain is, thinking just give me a severe headache ü§ì...geez! So thank you for your sincere compassion and intense desire to heal broken brains."
456,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,They remove fear about brain health,5,"Thinking about the health of our brains declining on any scale can and is rather scary, but the upbeat and lively presentation of brain health from the Amens is calming and informative. You'll definitely feel like binge-listening to this podcast, binge-reading their books and binge-watching their videos. Thank you both for all the work you do for us and God bless!"
457,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,How are you reading my mind?,5,"Oh my goodness Amens this podcast has been such a blessing in me & my families life. When I realized my daughter had ADD I went searching for holistic answers & found this podcast. The brain warriors way plus your book Healing ADD were answers to my prayers. It seems since the first day I found your podcast, that whatever is going on in our lives, somehow your next podcast gives me the insight I need. It‚Äôs like you can read my mindüëçüèº"
458,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,Changed my Life,5,"I stumbled on this podcast in October. I stepped on the scale and felt defeated. After listening to you guys explain how to view food, I started shopping at our local farmers market only. I consistently walk 2 miles a day and even got your cookbook to make it through the holidays. I loved the episode where you role played how to say no when people offer you food. I am watching the pounds come off. At times a bit slow, but I‚Äôm committed to this life change. I cannot say that those fast food chains do not beckon me at times but I pack some grapes, almonds or something healthy to satisfy me in the car. Thank you so much. I now am sad when I see moms at church popping doughnuts and pop tarts in their kiddos for a fast breakfast and realize that was me. I just didn‚Äôt know...."
459,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,A Bible for My Health,5,The podcast is to my health what the Bible is to my soul. It keeps me on track and motivates me to stay healthy when I go astray. I‚Äôve been following Dr. Amen‚Äôs work for the past 15 years and haven‚Äôt missed a Brain Warrior‚Äôs way podcast since it started. Please don‚Äôt ever stop. Hopefully one day I will be able to get a brain spec and take another step towards a healthier brain/life. Thank you!
460,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,I wish Tana would STOP INTERRUPTING!!,2,"Oh my GOSH! I am so interested in Dr. Amen‚Äôs advice, but I can‚Äôt stand to listen to this because his wife is CONSTANTLY interrupting him to talk about herself or step all over what he‚Äôs saying. Literally the most obnoxious thing I‚Äôve heard on a podcast. I also would like to hear more research and advice and less of a sales pitch. I‚Äôve only listened to 2018 episodes so hopefully 2019 is better or I‚Äôm out."
461,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,Dr. Amen & Tana,5,I love these guys! Great information that is honest and truthful. I am inspired every time I listen to do more & be more. Press onward Brain Warriors! Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è

Love Tana and how honest and real she is! She plays around and says people might unsubscribe from the podcast, never that! She‚Äôs real, how could we not appreciate her and her stories! She‚Äôs a strong woman! Thank you!!!"
463,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,Podcast themes provide positive life enrichment!,5,"Your podcast is my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù for mental and physical wellness. The cycling themes of healing past life events, current research data, and tips to manifest change create a 3-prong foundation for sustainable lifestyle. I have been reading your books for years and have now incorporated the ‚Äúthink dirty‚Äù app and share episodes with friends and my adult children.
Thanks for sharing your challenges-your work is great blessing to humanity."
464,The Brain Warrior's Way Podcast,Why?,3,Why was it that Dr Amen cut short Dr. Gordon discussing the trauma suffered by the Palestinian children who lost their parents during the bombing of Gaza. Dr. Amen said they would take a break to come back to discuss this more but the podcast interview was stopped afterwards. I‚Äôd like an answer to this.
465,Brute Strength Podcast,Good Topics and Guests but too many commercials,3,Many of the podcasts are about an hour long and 15 minutes of that hour are commercials or intro
466,Brute Strength Podcast,"Great content, too long on intro commercials",5,"Good podcast and great content on every episode, but shorten the intro commercials. I get it, you‚Äôre on WAG staff and they‚Äôre a sponsor, but make it a shorter commercial or in the details notes list what time the podcast actually starts so regular listeners can jump ahead. Or maybe break that commercial up into 15 second segments throughout the whole podcast. Love the podcast and i learn a lot, but the length of the intro is tough."
467,Brute Strength Podcast,Offensive podcast,1,"Listening to Jim Wendler episode, at 8:10 he makes misogynistic remarks about some women being ‚Äúcows‚Äù that particularly offend given that I am listening to the podcast while as a midlife woman working out. I used to love this podcast and am very disappointed. Please address this issue, remove that podcast, and/or bleep out the ‚Äúbrute‚Äù comments around minute 8:10."
468,Brute Strength Podcast,Always learning,5,"I‚Äôve been listening for years and I love this. Although Michael and I have never met, I feel like we mesh on so many levels and I truly enjoy his inquisitive approach to the podcast and his life as he shares it. I think he is a very genuine person that openly shares his own triumphs and tribulations through personal development and learning from the guests. The guests are always great to learn from but the individual episodes with just Michael are just as great. Love this brotha!ü§òüèª"
469,Brute Strength Podcast,Always applicable content!,5,Everything connects so well & Michaels authenticity on each episode helps pull you in!
470,Brute Strength Podcast,Absolutely Wonderful,5,My favorite podcast! Michael is an amazing host with such insightful questions. I learn something new every podcast even if I was not initially inclined to listen to that topic. Fantastic
471,Brute Strength Podcast,Favorite podcast!,5,Michael is the best host! So hilarious and down to earth. They always have really interesting guests too!
472,Brute Strength Podcast,"Great variety, great content, fun host",5,"Brute is one of only two podcasts I listen to EVERY week, regardless of who is on. Mike does an amazing job of asking insightful questions, letting the guest completely get their thought out without interruption, and then adding his own thoughts from experience. I always feel the guests they have on are knowledgable and providing unique insight. Huge fan of this podcast."
473,Brute Strength Podcast,Love,5,"I‚Äôm not even sure how I came across Brute Strength originally, but I am so glad that I did. As a new-ish Crossfitter, I originally started listening because I was hoping to learn more about the sport. I get so much more out of this Podcast than that. If you are a human, and you are looking to find those things in life to help you to be a better, healthier, more insightful person...this is a Podcast for you."
474,Brute Strength Podcast,Variety,5,"I really enjoy the variety of information that is on Brute Strength. You continue to have great guests on and excellent information. I even have the kids listen to parts of them when I pick them up from school, And then you usually drop an F bomb - although infrequent , it usually happens when kids are in the car......Hahahahaha"
475,Brute Strength Podcast,Great Program and Podcast,5,"The people at Brute Strength pays attention to detail. This is what sets them apart from the rest of the programs out there. Their growth mindset mentality allows athletes of all experience levels to have to opportunity to achieve goals/dreams they never thought was possible, and to always be reaching.

486,Brute Strength Podcast,#BruteAF,5,Being a person that has never been keen on ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù or radio talk in general; I would be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt subscribe and listen solely for the contest they have going on right now. That being said it wasn‚Äôt until about 20 min into the latest show where I realized on how much I have actually been missing out on. The wealth of knowledge these guys put out themselves and their guests FREE OF CHARGE is invaluable. Can honestly say the real win here is not in the contest...but actually the podcast itself. Just another reason that I‚Äôm proud of being apart of the brute family and will continue doing so for a long time to go!

After listening for a few months, I have learned things that have helped me to be more confident and trust that what I‚Äôve been looking for has been within me this whole time. I recently bought the book Magnetic. Even though, it‚Äôs still being shipped I was able to start the sample on Amazon. I look forward to reading the book in its entirety to learn more. Most of my past relationships with women have included multiple abuse situations that has left me jaded, but listening to the podcast I have been able to overcome that thought and go after what I know I deserve; beautiful quality women that are interested in me and having a good time. Thank you Tripp for the advice you give! Keep ‚Äòem coming!"

529,Underground Wellness Radio,UW - Take Control of U'r Life,4,"Been a regular listener since mid 2011.
This show is one of the best podcasts for a reason- Sean-
Keeps it real.
Interviews the best.
Has a crazy # shows and is tireless dedicated making quality content.
Sean keeps getting better at his craft. It will be fun to see where he goes next.
Your last w/ Josh Trent was inspirational! Had a falling out w/ your good friend and
bury the hatchet few years later pretty much live! But w/o the drama (no Jerry Springer here- but Intelligent!) yet very relatable for anyone who's been on life's roller coster. Thanks Sean -
Incredible show-
If this is a taste of where your going - Awsomeüëç
(Only four stars because I believe his best is yet to come) - like growing not just healthy but wealthy and wise. üö≤‚ôªÔ∏è‚ö°Ô∏èüòé‚ùóÔ∏è"
530,Underground Wellness Radio,6 years following,5,"Its been an amazing journey to listen to the evolution of this podcast and Sean's business and personal growth. I think after listening to every episode dating back to 2009 that I can say I earned an extra Masters Degree in health, wellbeing, and life in general."
531,Underground Wellness Radio,"Fun, informative and thought provoking",5,"Sean has great energy, but what I really love is that he will have pretty much EVERYONE and EVERY VIEW POINT on here at some point, even those that he doesn't agree with and who definitely don't agree with each other week to week.
It's a big ol' buffet of health info, science and opinions that you can listen to and see what resonates with you and incorporate it and just let the stuff go by that doesn't make sense to you.
Many ways to eat and live, all of them on this show at some point."
532,Underground Wellness Radio,Long time listener,5,I've been with you from the beginning of your start. You have been doing a great job and keep evolving for the better. Keep it up and thank you for brining in different sides of the story to keep us informed and thinking.
533,Underground Wellness Radio,"If you want to fall down the holistic rabbit hole, start here!",5,"Underground Wellness was my gateway into the world of holistic health. I fell in love with it pretty much immediately, and have been a listener for about four years now. I appreciate the balance of the real-life stories of his guests, solid science rather than simply fluff, and tips for practical application.
Sean is a fantastic interviewer; it‚Äôs been great to see him develop that skill over the years. And he does a great job of selecting guests from a wide variety of backgrounds and focuses.
Overall, five start podcast. If you have any interest in health, spend some time with this one. It‚Äôs eye-opening, informative, and entertaining as hell."
534,Underground Wellness Radio,I want his legacy to flourish,5,"Sean is a real man. He is passionate, radically curious, and committed to the leading the movement. i appreciate he is waking us up around the cutting edge and JERF (just eat real food) ideas of health and nutrition. He helps expose the Grand Scamming that we have been getting from the food industry for way too long. He does this primarily by educating himself and then others. The real part comes when he shows how he is growing as a practitioner and podcaster. Luckily I came to love him after the sound issue was resolved. I love his voracious appetite for learning all the stuff he wants us to learn. Thanx for being a GEEK FOR GOOD information and not pretending you know everything. The fact that Sean continues to help spread the good news in and engaging way make me want to promote him."
535,iProcrastinate Podcast,"Inactive, but still worth the listen",5,"I am writing this review during the COVID-19 pandemic. I‚Äôm a criminal defense attorney and usually spend most of my days in courtrooms, but because of the current situation, I am currently trying to work from home like everyone else. For the past several years, I have found myself listening to this podcast when working from home. When working on more mind consuming projects, I tend to listen to instrumental jazz because hearing words or even lyrics being sung, breaks up my flow. But when I am going through email, filing or doing other less menial tasks, I am usually listening to this podcast. Even though it has been over two years since a new episode, the information is still useful. Just yesterday, I was listening to an episode on anemic intentions, which I have been thinking about since. The information is very thought provoking and helpful. I understand that Dr. Pychyl has stated that the reason he hasn‚Äôt put out any new episodes is because he has covered most everything in the field, but it would be nice to get an update sometime on your current work. How about it Dr. Pychyl? For old times‚Äô sake?"
536,iProcrastinate Podcast,Very practical and warm heartedly personal,5,"I am a clinical psychologist in private practice and have referred people to this podcast regularly. There is great research, tips/hacks, and cute stories about the professor‚Äôs kids and snowy Canada life."
537,iProcrastinate Podcast,Extremely helpful reviews of research,5,"I have listened to several of these podcasts and I find them well researched, and helpful.
The professor provides the background and previous research that led to the current topic of each podcast.
He gives credit to the other authors and researchers and provides titles so that the listener can look up other information if he likes.
Some reviewers don't like this academic approach but I love it because each theory is discussed and references are provided. Often times people will say things and you wonder how they came up with that but this professor explains exactly how the theories came into being.
I have found a golden nugget (or two or three) of help in each podcast.
That said, it's time for me to ""get started"" on my next task."
538,iProcrastinate Podcast,A Daily Listen,5,"I put this on while I make breakfast in the morning. Whatever the topic of the episode, it just helps me prepare my mind for the day to think about and objectively analyze procrastination. The content is very good."
539,iProcrastinate Podcast,I started at the beginning and am listening to them all,5,The professor is a very interesting and caring person. The podcast is very interesting and self aware. If you have a problem with procrastination this is a must listen.
540,iProcrastinate Podcast,Just tedious...,1,"Well I overall like the concept in the idea presented here this podcast is terrible because it takes forever to get to the point about 20 minutes to cover what could be said in 30 seconds. I listen to it at double-speed and it was still tedious slow and very boring. I got the impression that A small point being made was being stretched into a long podcast. This was highly recommended by a friend and so I had High hope's, and ended up being just very disappointed."
541,iProcrastinate Podcast,Very Informative - repost replays?,4,"Sometimes over my head, but very thought provoking with helpful strategies interspersed. Have you considered reposting early podcasts that define procrasitnation and are more elemental? I found the full list on your website after happening to hear them referenced. That location may not be easily located for less tech literate. Thanks for continued posting."
542,iProcrastinate Podcast,Please keep these podcasts up! Appreciate it.,5,Love them.
543,iProcrastinate Podcast,Little here for non-academics; try these instead,2,"Not a lot of practical advise here with the exception of the 5/10/13 ""Graduate Student Beats Her Proc. Challenge‚Äù and the 9/19/12 interview with Kelly McGonigal.(Clearly I‚Äôve listened to a lot of them! Took me a while to find others that DO help.) Luckily stumbled onto Paul Gilmartin‚Äôs Mental Illness Happy Hour and from there ADHD Experts Podcast. Procrastinators: if you‚Äôve never been screened for ADD/ADHD, do it. It has changed my outlook greatly on the root causes of my crippling procrastination, and there are some truly helpful podcasts out there, plus real support ‚Äî once you know what to look for."
544,iProcrastinate Podcast,great easy to listen to & very helpful,5,great easy to listen to & very helpful
545,iProcrastinate Podcast,One of these days......,5,I've been meaning to listen to this. I'll write a review when I get around to it.
546,iProcrastinate Podcast,Very informative!,5,"I have only gotten through about 15 podcasts, but I really like how these podcasts are presented and how useful they are at understanding why we (especially me!) procrastinate. Even better, Dr. Pychyl mentions ways to combat procrastination! Thanks for helping me out, I look forward to listening to the other 75 podcasts!"
547,iProcrastinate Podcast,Fantastic Resource for Procrastinators!,5,The author provides comprehensive coverage of all facets of procrastination. Listening to this podcast has improved my life by giving me more insight into why I put off things I don't want to do. Highly recommended!!!
548,iProcrastinate Podcast,Bland,1,A lot of redundant information. The host and guest speakers are not very engaging for the listeners.
549,iProcrastinate Podcast,I'm still procrastinating,1,"I saw this podcast, but I haven't subscribed yet. There seems to be so many episodes that I don't know where to start."
550,iProcrastinate Podcast,i procrastinate,5,"I love this podcast. I started listening in 2006, and then lost track of it after he didn't update for awhile, I've only started listening to it again. I'm still a huge procrastinator, but there is always something to learn."
551,iProcrastinate Podcast,Great insight into Procrastination,5,Excellent Podcast! I recently discovered it and now I am in the process of listening to all the archived podcasts. All the psychology and research are very interesting. I find myself realizeing so much of what I do with procrastination and finding little tips on how I should help to manage it. Its not a cure for procrastiantion as Dr. Pchyl will say but listening does help me to be more aware which is the first step to making changes.
552,iProcrastinate Podcast,one of the best podcasts around,5,I am a huge fan of these podcasts. They are the best around. Professor Pychyl gives no-nonsense and no-hype information. Well worth the listen.
553,iProcrastinate Podcast,"Fascinating, helpful, informative and eye-opening",5,"Toes the line between self-help and academic with interviews of professors and researchers in psychology of motivation, personal anecdotes and Dr. Pychyl's own insights into the thorny problem of procrastination - the act of giving in to feel good!"
554,iProcrastinate Podcast,Helpful,5,"Very useful for youngsters who see a lot of avenues for distraction and end up putting off important, productive tasks."
555,iProcrastinate Podcast,Looking for a distraction?,5,"If you've got something important you should be working on, there's nothing better than listening to an iProcrastinate podcast to keep you from your work."
556,iProcrastinate Podcast,Practical and Informative,5,This is by far the best podcast I have found. In a month's time I have listened to almost all of the available podcasts. I'm looking forward to the release of a new one! Dr. Pychyl has not released one since February. The podcast is not only about procrastination. It makes connections to all aspects of life. It is rooted on the idea that every individual has the opportunity to manufacture happiness by prioritizing goals and pursuing them every day. If you haven't listened yet...just get started!! That phrase will take on a whole new meaning once you do!
557,iProcrastinate Podcast,Can't wait,5,I am so excited to listen to this podcast. Tomorrow‚Ä¶
558,iProcrastinate Podcast,Treasure trove of info,5,Dr. Pichyl thanks for sharing all this info with the world. It really helps us understand procrastination backed by academic research. I highly recommend this to anyone with interests or struggles with this subject.
559,iProcrastinate Podcast,More than self help...,5,"This podcast is chock full of practical, compassionate insight about procrastination, and that's super-useful. However, the real message is existential: life is shorter than we think. Delay just ruins the precious time we've got. Grab that task, find the joy, and live your life as fully as you can... It is a short, sweet, precious life, so don't waste it. Love this podcast, it's changing my life!"
560,iProcrastinate Podcast,Practical advice,5,"Dr. Pychyl offers practical suggestions on how to deal with this all too common human condition. He has a great voice and asks interesting questions - and actually listens when the interviewee answers. His monologues are fantastic too. I just wish that he would post more often. But considering that this is a free resource, I am extremely grateful to him for making the time to share his knowledge and strategies with the world."
561,iProcrastinate Podcast,love to learn!,5,this is a fantastic podcast! try it!
562,iProcrastinate Podcast,GONE?,5,"Love this podcast. While dry, I found it very informative and helpful, even inspiring. So sad he‚Äôs given it up."
563,iProcrastinate Podcast,Helpful for everyone,5,"I discovered this podcast a couple years ago (at the time I was a full time working mom of one). It is amazing how much I've learned about how my own mind worked - it has been a lesson of humility. Ha! My mind is more clear and focused with each episode, whether that is its intention or not. I am currently a stay at home mom of two and I've listened to all the podcasts again and each is just as applicable now - even though I struggle with procrastination differently. I appreciate hearing the research in an understandable way. I can't thank Dr Pychyl enough. I have recommended this podcast to many."
564,iProcrastinate Podcast,Practical and empirically sound,5,"I am a clinical psychologist and just found this podcast. I am so impressed at the quality of each episode and find the content useful personally and professionally. Thank you so much, Dr. Pychyl, for this great contribution!"
565,Spartan Up! - A Spartan Race for the Mind!,Enough of the complaining.,1,"Do we really need the trope of ‚Äúkids these days.‚Äù Come on. The Boomers certainly screwed things up royally for this world. Every Gen has pros and cons, after the latest episode, had to unsubscribe."

568,Spartan Up! - A Spartan Race for the Mind!,"Superb, been listening for years",5,"This podcast is absolutely wonderful, I have learned so much over the years from Joe, his team and the various guests. I am very grateful for it. I only have one critique. The interviews are too short. Not everyone has a short commute. I will be listening to a really great interview, then all of a sudden it‚Äôs over. I simply cannot understand how such a superb put together team goes through so much trouble to travel the world and do these amazing interviews and cut them so short?
Joe, I respectfully request longer podcast, but thank you for what you and your crew do."
569,Spartan Up! - A Spartan Race for the Mind!,Inspiring,5,"Superior interviews with discussions and recaps that help me grow and improve at home, work, in life."
570,Spartan Up! - A Spartan Race for the Mind!,Don‚Äôt go commercial,1,"I usually love these podcasts but this was a commercial for the waffles. Saying it isn‚Äôt A commercial doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt.

574,Spartan Up! - A Spartan Race for the Mind!,Awesome,1,"Original, informative, positive. Great work. Nice to see this in such negative, harsh times"
575,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Great Perspective Overall,5,Dr Foucher is a natural at allowing her guest to truly share. She doesn‚Äôt smother guest point of view and allows for conversations to happen organically. This podcast isn‚Äôt all about Crossfit - I feel like it‚Äôs more of a healthy and balanced perspective in life. Great work Doc!
576,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,great podcast,5,The host is a driven and intelligent medical professional and she interviews wonderful guests ranging from fellow cross-fitters to nutritionists to scientists. I always come away with new information thanks to the sharp host. Great podcast!
577,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Julie, host of the Pursuing Health podcast, highlights all aspects of health, fitness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
578,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Crossfit Propaganda,1,"I used to enjoy this podcast. Now Julie is more busy with work, and I feel like she goes to the Crossfit Games and gets a lot of shows in the can and then releases them later. The show used to involve more researchers, etc. Now it is just people within the Crossfit machine.
Which gets to my next point. It would be really nice to occasionally hear from someone that may have a differing opinion. Julie seems focused on brining in people that will confirm her and CrossFit‚Äôs beliefs/bias.
There is too much amazing actual research going on for such a slanted Crossfit perspective. Challenging Crossfit on some of their conclusions would only benefit Crossfit in the long run. They and Julie should stop being so opposed to such challenges."
579,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Best health podcast,5,So informative and always has amazing guest
580,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Great Resource,5,Wonderful interviews! Keep up the great job. Top of my list.

Going to pursue my Functional Med license now ! Julie - you rock !"
582,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Great Podcast!,5,Thanks Julie! Your podcasts are terrific. As a fellow MD who‚Äôs pretty new (but addicted) to CrossFit I really get a lot out of your interviews. Keep up the great work!
583,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Great podcast!,5,Extremely informative. Presents complex medical information in a clear and concise way.
584,Pursuing Health with Julie Foucher,Super Informative Show,5,"I love this show - great topics, easy to listen to and just plan good content"
585,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,So helpful and comforting,5,"It is such a helpful listen, very grounding, informative and interesting."
586,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Validation,5,This is a great podcast. Helpful tips and super validating. Feels so good to be understood. Thanks!
587,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Great Listen,5,I enjoy this podcast so much! Dr. Ned has a way of making those of us with ‚ÄúRace car engines and bicycle breaks‚Äù feel special in a positive light.
588,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Thank God for Dr. H!,5,"‚ÄúDistraction‚Äù is one of my go-to podcasts when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed, frustrated or just need some clarity in my day-to-day life. This podcast is positive, interesting, stimulating, challenging and motivating. Dr. Hallowell touches on all areas of living, and every message encourages better living. Thank you for this fantastic resource!"
589,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Thanks!,5,I have used MANY of the ideas generated from these podcasts to reorganize my life after the diagnosis. I‚Äôm very grateful to all the positivity and support offered by Dr. Hallowell. Keep up the good work and I will keep patronizing this podcast!
590,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Married to Distraction,5,"Learn more about ADHD! Dated hyper focused. Light switch flipped off on the drive home from the wedding dinner. God, I love this man. ADHD in marriage needs lots of support and I‚Äôve found it here as I learn more."
591,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,ADHD Chick,5,So glad I came across this podcast! Great content and insight along with the gentle nudge to put yourself out into the world and connect with others. This podcase has been tremendously helpful to me in navigating my few first months with managing my ADHD (newly diagnosed at age 50). Thank you Dr. Hallowell and team!
592,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,A new perspective on ADHD!,5,"I studied psychology in college, so I had a preliminary understanding of ADHD. I also grew up as a daughter of an elementary and middle school teacher, so I heard her stories of an interaction with ADHD. That all being said, Dr. H made a topic like ADHD relatable and interesting to me because he provided so much depth and a new perspective on it. Thank you for shedding light on such a topic!"
593,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Lost credibility,1,"The host lost all credibility with me when he started talking about climate change. He‚Äôs old enough to have lived through at least 6 doomsday climate catastrophe predictions that never came to pass. The same modus operandi every time: fear is sown by leftists and the only thing that can save the world is us giving up our money and freedom. Anyone with an iota of common sense should question the current claims.
The climate IS changing. It‚Äôs been changing for a few billion years. It‚Äôs been warming for 20,000 years. The Earth‚Äôs relationship to the sun, and the activity of the sun, are what causes climate change and yet none of the ‚Äúmodels‚Äù even consider the sun.
Also, CO2 isn‚Äôt a pollutant. Plants need it. Plants take in CO2 and release O2. Even if it was a pollutant, it‚Äôs a very minor greenhouse gas. The most prominent greenhouse gas being water vapor (clouds and fog).
These are all obvious, common sense points that anyone with half a brain should realize, so when someone doesn‚Äôt, one has no choice but to question their credibility.
Sadly, I‚Äôm through with this podcast. I can no longer give any credence to what he says."
594,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Great info for ADHDers!,5,Great info to implement and understand ADHD! Thank you!
595,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Good short episodes,5,"Good audio quality, good interviewer, episodes are short enough for someone who is distractable to pay attention. Good pointers to actions you can take and people/books/other podcasts for diving in deeper on specific ideas/topics.
Great for not feeling alone in our challenges."
596,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,So helpful,5,"Ned Hallowell's discussions and helpful tips on living with ADHD have been a life-changer for our family. Not only do we read and re-read his book Driven from Distraction, these podcasts have helped us with on-going learning and support for our ADHD son. Ned's voice and demeanor are so warm, upbeat, and reassuring. It's a must for those with ADHD that are committed to living their best life!"
597,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Amazing and very helpful,5,"Love that each episode is packed full of useful information (No wasteful irrelevant stories). I‚Äôm newly diagnosed as a 46 year old adult male, and this podcast is one of the only things guiding me toward success. Dr. Hallowell is truly a kind hearted and caring individual as well as the most comprehensive expert in the field of ADHD."
598,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Boys,5,I have had the hardest time trying to figure out if it was me or my son. I made the mistake of listening to a teacher and a family member. He‚Äôs 12 now and I have been wrong and confused and I love him more from listening to Dr. Thompson. Thank you
599,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Savior for Women with ADHD,5,I was diagnosed with Inattentive Type ADHD very recently at 25 years old. One of the first things I did was look for resources to try to move forward. This podcast has armed me with the knowledge and confidence I need to combat the shame and confusion I‚Äôve been living with most of my life. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!
600,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,The one thing I disagree with,4,I'm a recent listener as I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD. I don't agree with comments on weed. Marijuana has shown great promise in treatment for the opioid crisis. It has madicinal benefits. There is even research on how it can help ADHD.
601,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Entertaining and educational,5,"It really helps to hear other peoples stories. These along with audio books help connect the dot to re-learning myself. Hopefully finding myself soon. My auditory and visual processing is very slow, but being able to always listen to podcast on my devices help immensely! I am always learning and connecting the dots.Its very hard for me to read, let alone remember what i read, on or off meds. Thank you for the time and information."
602,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Dr. Ned!!,5,This show is the most informative podcast ever on the topic of ADD/ADHD that I have been able to find. I HIGHLY recommend this podcast to anyone struggling with attention disorder!!
603,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Hosted by an expert,5,"Such a great ADHD podcast hosted by one of the most respected experts in the field. In addition, he‚Äôs compassionate and wise."
604,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,So needed,5,"Thank you so much for teaching and educating about ADHD. The very first episode I heard was the one with Dr William Dodson & it‚Äôs the one I needed most right now. So glad I found this podcast as I‚Äôm now working my way backwards, listening and learning."
605,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Incredible resource!,5,As a former educator and someone currently working in the field of educational technologies I have found that the content and guests on this podcast give a perfect overview on a given topic and include some very meaningful insights. It is also a great way to discover more resources (such as understood.org) instead of having to conduct a search yourself. Thank you!
606,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Life Changing,5,"I stumbled upon this podcast while trying to find pertinent information for both myself and my college entry son who is now having some difficulty navigating in college. He did well at home with lots of structure in sports right now was thrown into an environment that is not conducive to his learning style or the ADHD diagnosis. This podcast has been so very beneficial and helpful in the process of navigating with my adult ADD diagnosis along with my son who has ADHD. Very helpful information and resources. I would love to learn more about executive functioning and working memory. I have had a lot of difficulty with both. Keep up the good work. I am looking forward to new podcasts.
Thank you,
Karen"
607,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Amazing!,5,This podcast is totally one of the best podcasts I‚Äôve ever listened to. I am an Adult recently diagnosed with ADD and I‚Äôve never been on any meds and I don‚Äôt take any meds right now either. I‚Äôve been having neurofeedback sessions and they‚Äôve been helping me and also dr. Ned hollowell‚Äôs podcasts have been helping me alot in dealing with my problems in life.
608,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Just wonderful!,5,I have been hearing this podcast for a while. Great content and guests.
609,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Great Source... but...,5,"I‚Äôve learned a lot about ADHD and many techniques presented. With that said, you introduce your podcast by saying it‚Äôs about ADHD and ASD, but I never hear anything about ASD. I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and a few years ago after dealing with some heavy struggles, the doc dropped the You‚Äôre High Functioning ASD bomb. I‚Äôve learned a lot, but I deal with a lot of crap from decades of living with this. Anyhow, I keep anxiously waiting to hear the words - today we‚Äôre going to talk about ASD. Thanks for all your hard work my friend. Ken"
610,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Essential information for ADHD,5,Dr Hallowell‚Äôs expertise in treating ADHD shines through in this informative podcast. Great information for adults with adhd or parents of children with adhd. I really appreciate his focus on connection as a key lifestyle factor to help with adhd.
611,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Informative & supportive,5,"Having been diagnosed as an adult with ADHD, and having a spouse and 2 kiddos with ADHD too, this podcast has been a MAJOR source of excellent advice and references of the major researchers in the field as well as relevant and practical support when I needed it most. Also got to hear Dr. Hallowell at a conference and he is as amazing in person as he is in the podcast. Seriously my top podcast!!!"
612,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Relatable and helpful,5,Dr. Hallowell is genuine and provides good information in a way that‚Äôs easy to understand. This is a great podcast for the everyday person trying to live a better life with ADD/ADHD.
613,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,So timely and helpful!,5,"I really love this podcast, because as an adult with adhd, I need two things... interest and help with time. This podcast hits both. The topics are excellent and relevant. The length of each podcast never goes beyond what my attention can handle. Thank you Dr. Hallowell!"
614,Distraction with Dr. Ned Hallowell,Insightful and so helpful in working with my ADHD child and Co-workers,5,"I happened upon this podcast while searching for something new, so thankful God lead me here. I personally appreciated a recent podcast specifically relating to women and adolescent girls with ADHD. My daughter was overlooked for her symptoms, though I had asked teachers about them for years, because she was the quiet daydreamer in the back of the class. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
615,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,My favorite podcast,5,Runners Connect podcast has been my go-to running companion for the last couple years... I always listen on my long runs! The coaches are so much fun to listen to and so knowledgeable and their topics pertain to all of us runners at one time or another! Loving the new format soooo much!!!
616,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Great resource for runners,5,"Beyond celebrity interviews, this podcast brings a wealth of actionable information to runners. Claire brings the vast knowledge and research she puts into coaching to the podcast for everyone's benefit."
617,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,The new format,5,I love the new format. So much easier to listen to. I don‚Äôt have to switch between podcasts mid run. The information is clear and researched.
618,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,"Great, informative, fun to listen to",5,"I‚Äôve been listening for a few years, and the show is formatted so that I feel like I can relate and apply nearly everything covered. I love the coaches, and look forward to hearing more."
619,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Sound quality!!,1,"Please do something about your sound quality! It‚Äôs painful, I shut it off after a minute."
620,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Listen and learn -- while you run!,5,"I love this runner's podcast and it's short supplement the Extra Kick. The cheerful host Claire asks good questions and really keeps the conversations moving.
On my easy, long run days RTT is one of my favorite ways to pass the time."
621,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,So happy for the new host,5,I was so happy to hear Coach Claire was going to be the new host. I stopped listening to this podcast for the past couple of years and only listened to the Extra Kick version where Claire was one of my favorites. Good choice!
622,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Great new host,5,Wow. Claire is amazing. So glad to see this change. Awesome start to the new Run to the Top. Can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds!!!
623,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Great New Host for this Podcast,5,"I listened to Coach Claire‚Äôs first interview today and I‚Äôm very impressed with the new host. Claire has a great interview style, allows the guest to talk and guides the conversation as needed. I‚Äôm looking forward to great things. This podcast also has a treasure trove of old episodes that are worth a look."
624,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Claire needs to drink water,3,"Your mouth sounds are tough to tolerate. Drink water please. It will help your dry mouth. Love the podcast, though, and it was very good"
625,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,I can‚Äôt listen anymore.,1,Sad because I used to really enjoy this. Cannot listen to Atwood‚Äôs grating voice. Change your host and I‚Äôll return.
626,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Love this podcast!,5,I've been listening to this podcast for almost a year now an thoroughly enjoy it. I especially liked the recent interview with Sarah Crouch!
627,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Never miss an episode,5,"Truly enjoy Ms Atwood's perspective. Comes to the interview as a seasoned runner/coach. The interview is relaxed, comfortable but focused. Great job."
628,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Hard to listen to,2,"I took a break after Ms. Atwood first started hosting & hoped she‚Äôd improve with experience. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think she has. The ideas behind the topics are interesting, but her delivery is very stiff & rehearsed-sounding (I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs reading from a script). I don‚Äôt get the sense that she allows the conversation to flow naturally, just goes off the pre-planned list. The poor sound quality probably makes the effect worse. It‚Äôs not awful, but there are many far more engaging running podcasts out there."
629,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Excellent running podcast.,5,"Great sound quality.
Teaching for experience, amazing.!!
The information is coming from expert in the field, and conducted with kindness and humble.
Q: It‚Äôs possible to train for a marathon using the pool as the main environment? I‚Äôm a 56 y male, with ‚Äúno meniscus and osteoarthritis‚Äù on my right knee. üòÅ"
630,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Inconsistent,3,"Topics sometimes interesting, sometimes bizarre. I subscribe but delete many episodes immediately."
631,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Used to be good,1,"I used to really enjoy this podcast. With the change to the newest interviewer it has really gone down hill. Ask poor questions, guesses at her interviewees answers in the questions.
In a recent episode she couldn‚Äôt stop laughing as the interviewee told an story of being charged by a grizzly bear."
632,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Can‚Äôt relate to me host,3,"This used to be one of my favorite running podcasts, but since Stephanie became host I find it unrelateable and awkward. Stephanie comes prepared, but almost too prepared in that she sounds stiff and out of touch with the conversation and real life. She doesn‚Äôt let conversations flow naturally, she directs them the way she wants them to go. It sounds like I‚Äôm listening to my parents talk about something they think they know what they‚Äôre talking about but don't. I only listen now if the guest is really interesting. Otherwise I just get frustrated listening."
633,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Just not into the new host,3,Just can‚Äôt listen to the new host. She seems nice but this is not the best thing for her. Guests are decent but interviews are awkward.
634,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Declining,1,Was great under the previous host - much more natural and free flowing. New show and host is okay however often plagued by audio issue and the conversation flow feels forced and awkward. Topics have been more spotty and downloads often deleted now - maybe jumped the shark for me today with the zombie apocalypse ultra running novelist episode
635,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Terrible audio,1,"I listened to this podcast previously with no problems but over the past year there‚Äôs always sound problems (i.e. high pitched whistling, interviews that break up). It was enough to make me unsubscribe which means I‚Äôll never listen again since I won‚Äôt be reminded of new episodes."
636,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Excited for Claire‚Äôs Impact,5,I have been a long-time follower of Runner‚Äôs Connect and the massive amount of high- quality video and podcast content they produce. I look forward to listening to Claire as she takes this podcast forward with her point of view.
637,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,So excited about Claire Bartholic host,5,Have always learned so much from her episodes on the Runners Connect Coaches Chat. Can‚Äôt wait to hear her in the longer format!
638,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Love the content. Hate the host,3,"I strongly agree with previous reviews about the host. Please host, stop talking over your guests!! We don‚Äôt need your little ‚Äúyeah‚Äù ‚Äúmmhmm‚Äù ‚Äúright‚Äù feedback after every breath your guest takes! Again, love the content and you have great guest speakers but it‚Äôs just too annoying to listen to the host try to affirm them. The interviews end up sounding rushed and awkward. I hope they change hosts or at least train them to relax and let others talk."
639,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Become your own listener to improve a good thing,4,"Your podcast does such a good job of attracting really good people to interview. I really enjoy the variety and focus of people that you bring on the podcast. I do however have one very strong suggestion for the host Stefanie, that I hope you consider. Listen to your own podcast and consider that you are conducting an interview not a conversation. While your guest is answering your questions you continually talk over them by reacting with little affirmation words which become very hard to listen to as a subscriber. I would encourage you to save your reactions for the natural pause that happens when your guest is finished answering. Your reactions are natural during a conversation but during an interview it makes listening to the podcast very difficult. I think overall you do a great job and it saddens me when I stop listening due to the fact that your interruptions become so annoying I can‚Äôt listen any further. I think you can become a better interviewer by approaching it that way instead of a conversation. I hope you take my criticism constructively because that is my intent."
640,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Awesome!!,5,Love the new host! Super down to earth and approachable! #gowomanhosts
641,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Not as good anymore,3,Interviews don‚Äôt flow well and the host‚Äôs voice often feels flat and awkward. The interviewing style lacks energy. I love the variety of runners being interviews but I don‚Äôt believe they are being utilized by the host‚Äôs lack of podcast/interviewing skills.
642,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,I can‚Äôt listen anymore,1,"Used to enjoy it. Now when I listen, I‚Äôm annoyed. Just not my cup of tea anymore. I run and I always tell myself that I can quit the second I‚Äôm not having fun. This podcast, for me, has been not fun for months. Unsubscribing and a little sad."
643,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,Audio is horrible,2,"I‚Äôm not sure if there is mic feedback or what, but all of the interviews and broken up. Although I like the content, I can‚Äôt hear the interviews."
644,Run to the Top Podcast | The Ultimate Guide to Running,"I used to love it, but not anymore",2,"I rarely listen to this podcast anymore, and when I do I'm still annoyed by the host's voice and lack of comfortable interview skills. I'm not generally a critical person, but I can't get past the host's grating voice and laugh. I've about given up on getting some informative content that doesn't involve advertising for the guest."
645,Happy Black Woman Podcast with Rosetta Thurman,Amazing Podcast,5,So glad I found this podcast. Every episode is filled with amazing content. Thanks Rosetta for showing up in the world to help empower and inspire woman like me. Thank you. ‚ù£Ô∏è

652,Happy Black Woman Podcast with Rosetta Thurman,First time listener!,5,"I absolutely loved her. She was giving all the passion, energy and wisdom necessary to empower women!

656,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,The Podcast I‚Äôve Been Searching For,5,"Thank you and all of your brilliant, fascinating, and sexy guests, Tristan, for going deeper into and beyond traditional topics of kink and sexuality. Your insights and interviews are inspirations!"
657,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,"Compelling, intimate and actionable",5,"Tristan and her wide variety of knowledgeable guests share extremely relevant info how to get on the right track to an invigorating, intimate and mutually rewarding sex life.
The great content and advice she provide, combined with the relatable way in which she delivers it had me hooked from the very first listen. Thanks for putting out such a stellar show Tristan - keep up the great work!"
658,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Thank you Tristan!,5,"Tristan Taormino has been making smart, engaging, informative, and sexy stuff for decades. What a treat to be able to hear her and her guests for free, anytime I want, as long as I have my phone with me. No more need be said about this icon of sex positivity; just listen."
659,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Interesting and varied. Too many ads.,3,Enjoy the show. Way too many commercials for a podcast. A solid quarter of each episode is same ads over and over.
660,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Tristan is my sex-ed guru goddess,5,"I've been listening to Sex Out Loud since the very beginning and it only gets better with each episode. Tristan's passion for the subject and her dedication to diversity in all its forms is inspiring. I've heard the most interesting guests on her show and learned so much. Every book that's ever mentioned gets added to the list for my own personal sex ed library. Thanks for all that you do, Tristan! <3"
661,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Always a great listen,5,Wonderful and refreshing podcast on a variety of topics. Tristan is always on point!
662,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,The Gold Standard,5,"As far as we're concerned, Sex Out Loud is the gold standard of sex-positive podcasting, and we listen religiously (often in-store - customers dig it, too). Ms. Taormino has a rare, awesome combination of sharp insight, kind wit and a mellifluous voice that makes every moment of the 'cast a joy. There's virtually no one I wouldn't recommend Sex Out Loud to - heartily. Listen!! You'll be glad you did :)
- Katz Boutique in the Galleria (HOU)"
663,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Life changing,5,I received my doctorate in Clinical Sexology a year ago. I have not done much work in the field since then and was looking for directions on how to get started in the field. Tristan's podcast has changed my life. It is extremely educational and covers a wide array of subjects. More impressive is that she brings in the experts so I always feel like I'm in a classroom learning from the best professors. I absolutely love her show!
664,Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino,Absolutely love the show.,5,I learned a lot listening to this show. It's like the Oprah of sex positive podcast. I had no idea there was so much to learn about this part of life. A well thought out show. And Tristan you rock.
665,Ask a Clean Person,Cleaning convert,5,"Thanks to this podcast, I no longer feel like an utter failure at cleaning. I‚Äôve learned so much, which has given me the motivation to keep up with regular cleaning tasks. Thanks, Jolie. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying your hiatus."
666,Ask a Clean Person,Should be good,2,"Lots of rambling in the hat episode. Talks fast. Tells you side stories to fill time and takes a while to get to the heart of the matter. Reminds me of an online recipe that gives you 1000 words on their kids‚Äô activities, the new paint color in their hall and then finally gives you the cookie recipe you wanted."
667,Ask a Clean Person,Get to the point!,2,"I dearly wanted to love this podcast. I can tell Jolie is smart, well-researched, and has a lot of very solid information to share. But I don't have 50 minutes to spend trying to sift out 10-15 minutes of practical advice. I get that she wants the show to be funny and entertaining, but the long asides and rambling interludes do a disservice to her and the show by burying the lead and her real talent ‚Äî with cleaning. The show could be a third of the time and I bet its popularity would increase. Its just too padded with unneeded, insider-y (with her guests) banter ‚Äî it's frustrating to try to have to wait out the chatter to extract the info I came to the show for in the first place."
668,Ask a Clean Person,Love this so much!!!,5,Jolie is amazing and has so many great insights!!! A must listen!!!
669,Ask a Clean Person,Awesome podcast!,5,"Highly recommend for the laughs, a companion (and a reason!) to do your weekly cleaning, and seriously great tips. I‚Äôve listened for a few years and learned so much. What I love is that I‚Äôve learned the science behind different cleaning methods so I can put those into practice when I face a new cleaning quandary ‚ú® thanks Jolie!!"
670,Ask a Clean Person,thank you for saving me,5,i used to be so gross
671,Ask a Clean Person,Excellent podcast,5,"Have listened to this almost since the beginning and learned so much. Jolie is very knowledgeable and creative. The podcast is unique because it is really fun to listen to as well -- it is like being at a party, sometimes with everyone talking at once. The language is a little rough at times but there is so much laughter and great information it is well worth it."
672,Ask a Clean Person,I‚Äôve learned so much!,5,This podcast has taught me soo much! Abt how to clean tough stains! Super helpful
673,Ask a Clean Person,Surprisingly useful.,2,"I have been listening to these episodes (and chip chat) for a few moths. I listen while I‚Äôm at work because Jolie is very entertaining and don‚Äôt think I was absorbing anything useful, until my daughter brought me the shirt needed to wear to band. The white shirt with purple letters had a huge puppy pee stain. I was amazed that my brain knew exactly how to save it. Thanks Jolie."
674,Ask a Clean Person,Great info.. takes rather a long time to get it,4,"I am really grateful for all of the clever and/or common sense tips I have learned, thank you. I wish you would not apologize for a short episode. It was a welcome break from the hyper-enthusiastic, overly-inside-baseball episodes of the last year. More shorter, focused episodes please."
675,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Helpful tips but pics are not always helpful,4,"I really enjoy listening to Q&A episodes. I wish those episodes are more frequent. I find pics for poses useful but not always helpful. Just bad editing, I guess. For instance, voice is narrating about the placement of feet yet the demonstrator's log pants are completely covering her feet. The only thing I can see is her toes. And from one sequence to next, big chunk of movements are missing - you see her on the floor and next thing, she is up. What happened in between? Those in-between movements are so crucial. I love how each asana is spelled out and each Sanskrit meaning is explained. It is very helpful. Overall, pics are bit amateurish but helpful. I recommend this podcast."
676,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Fantastic!!!,5,"I first went to CPY in january of this year back in Denver when visiting with my girlfriend who grew up there and was a regular with Heather. It was fantastic! Best I've ever experienced, althought I'm still a newbie :) I felt great. When she moved to Hungtinton Beach in Los Angeles, we went to her again, did someone say groupies? :p I haven't done Yoga for a while but I've been meaning to go back which is ~40 min drive for me :( But the podcast shows great positions and following them really helps in and out of a session. I give 5 stars bc I love this home away from home :)"
677,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Wonderful!!,5,I've been practicing with CPY for almost 5 years. What a fantastic addition! The classes and instructors are always challenging yet thoughtful. Keep up the great work!
678,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Very helpful!!,4,"So helpful!! I am new to yoga and having the postures broken down is great! The direction in the video is great. I was able to follow along easily, and didn‚Äôt feel like the queues were over my head!"
679,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,5,I loved these podcasts! I'm a huge fan of CPY and am now able to take my yoga on the road.
680,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Cheesy Over Rated Exercise,1,"CorePower has sucessfully compromised and commercialized Baptist's strain of so-called power yoga which, compared to traditional forms of yoga, wasn't that great to begin with (CP also compromises Bikrim hot-yoga as well, avoiding franchise fees to the developer). However, it is a fair form of aerobics, but for anyone truly interested in learning proper yoga and developing their practice (and their body) they would be much wiser to devote their practice time to one of the disciplined yoga varieties such as Hatha, Astonga, Anusara or Iyengar. I have formerly taken a number of CorePower classes and have almost always left with a feeling of dissatisfaction, whether the class was in Denver or San Diego. In my opinion, CORE stands for cheesy-over-rated-exercise which will lead to poorly constructed yoga poses. CorePower has been quite successful employing often cute female trainers, but you can have a quality class with a better instructor and often cheaper elsewhere. Traditional yoga has been around for 5000 years and it may be a sign of our times to think that commercializing it can make it better. Even on iTunes better choices are available. Namaste."
681,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,"Good, but too much ""stuff"" before I get to see yoga",3,"I enjoy the classes offered at Core Power yoga, but this podcast has too much ""stuff"" before you can get into the meat of the information. I don't want to sit and watch the long drawn out ad for the business each time. Anyway you can make this a video instead of still photos?"
682,CorePower Yoga Podcasts,Awesome Yoga Podcast - Tons of Good Information!,5,I'm glad I stumbled on this podcast. I've practiced at CorePower Yoga in Denver for years and love their classes. These videos will totally help me fine-tune my postures.
683,The WODcast Podcast,Fantastic podcast,5,I love the diversity it‚Äôs not all about crossfit and fits my lifestyle! I look forward to hearing it every week.
684,The WODcast Podcast,Recorded too loud,3,"I liked a couple of the episodes, but I cannot listen anymore without causing hearing loss. This is the only podcast I‚Äôve ever listened to that sounds like people are screaming on the lowest volume setting. Eddie must be borderline deaf."
685,The WODcast Podcast,Gfy,5,Funny stuff
686,The WODcast Podcast,Wicked awesome podcast,5,"Been listening to this podcast for over two years, some changes through that time but Eddie has been a get host and gets to interview many interesting people in the CrossFit world, funny as hell and makes a great podcast to listen while driving to work. Eddie keep up the great job you do and I saw your comedy show in Worcester, MA , great live show also"
687,The WODcast Podcast,The tip top best!,5,The interviews Eddie does are phenomenal. They‚Äôre not only informative but funny as hell! The only improvement I could think to add is to do more each week! Keep rocking the show!
688,The WODcast Podcast,Still Killing It!,5,"Hands down best Crossfit/Fitness Podcast out there. Eddie is an OG at this fitness podcast game. Has been holding his own over the past year since going at it solo. Miss Armen and Scott at times, but he‚Äôs been killing it solo. Great content, high quality guests, Eddie knows his stuff coming prepared each week with content. Keep it up Eddie!!. Have picked up lots of tips / pointers from this show over the past 4 years I've been listening."
689,The WODcast Podcast,Best Fitness Show,5,No swag was given to me for this review :(
690,The WODcast Podcast,Great Show,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to the show for years and even with the changes it hasn‚Äôt lost its flair. Arguably better content and guests with the departure of previous hosts. Informational and entertaining, I look forward to new episodes each week.
A few years back I went to see Eddie perform just from being a fan of the show and he was hysterical. Strongly recommend!"
691,The WODcast Podcast,OG guests rule,5,The Pat Barber episode was a one of my favorites. Love the chemistry between y'all. Enjoyed Barbers perspective on coaching and love his account of Crossfit history. More guests like him and maybe even the head HNIC himself. Lesss go Eddie
692,The WODcast Podcast,One of the better fitness podcasts out there,5,"Eddie does a great job getting interesting guest and asking them questions that a dummy like me would ask.
This is the only podcast I listen to every week without missing. #listentotheintro"
693,The WODcast Podcast,Top of the Queue,5,The only podcast where I actually listen to all the advertisements
694,The WODcast Podcast,Disappointing,2,I want to love this podcast so much but there is always something annoying/ wrong with every episode. Like 1 mic is loud as hell and I can‚Äôt hear the other one and his daughter yells during the Hunter McIntyre episode. I only listen to comedy podcast so I love screwing around by this it‚Äôs almost like he doesn‚Äôt care about putting out a quality podcast! I‚Äôll keep coming back when there‚Äôs an interesting guest but please at least fix the little things dude!
695,The WODcast Podcast,Wodcast Podcast,5,Great job Eddie. I look forward to your podcast every week. Thanks for your hard work. 5 Stars.
696,The WODcast Podcast,Great podcast,5,"Great podcast!!! I miss Scott and Armen, but Eddie your are holding your own and doing an amazing job. I just finished listening to the episode with Troy and it was hilarious. Since you‚Äôve been on your own the guest list has been great and I‚Äôve enjoyed listening to all of the information that they‚Äôve brought to the podcast. Keep up the good work Eddie. #stilllistening"
697,The WODcast Podcast,Love this show !!,5,"I am new to CrossFit and have been listening for almost a year . This is my go to pod cast . I would listen every day if I there was a show. I love Eddie‚Äôs humor and is a great interviewer. The guests are knowledgeable and entertaining. I recommend anyone who is into CrossFit.
Eddie when are you coming to Syracue?"
698,The WODcast Podcast,Breath of fresh air,5,"Discovered this podcast a few months back and I must say, it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air in the crowded world of podcasts. Eddie brings on a wealth of funny and informative guests in the realm of health and fitness, not just CrossFit. Makes the long commute to work much better!"
699,The WODcast Podcast,Great for long drives,5,Like listening to this podcast on my long drives.
700,The WODcast Podcast,Great show,5,New listener. Great show.
701,The WODcast Podcast,What‚Äôs with the audio,2,I wanted this episode to be so good... but the audio at the beginning and the kid screaming.... Ugghhhh
702,The WODcast Podcast,Love this podcast,5,Great podcast. Very interesting and funny. Great for long car rides.
703,The WODcast Podcast,Disappointed,1,"The long ads in the middle of the show are awful. I understand the need for ads and at the beginning sure, but again in the middle of the show? I turned off the episode."
704,The WODcast Podcast,love the evolution!,5,"Eddie, I've been listening to the podcast since the beginning. I loved the dynamic among you, Armen, and Scott, but on you're own, you're doing an amazing job of getting diverse guests and having engaging, thoughtful conversations. You somehow manage to channel the best of all 3 of you into the newest version of the show, while making it your own unique show at the same time. Love it!"
705,The WODcast Podcast,"Great Podcast: Funny, Informative, Relaxing",5,"This is the first podcast review that I‚Äôve felt compelled enough to write after listening for about a year. All of Eddie‚Äôs interviews are super interesting if you‚Äôre interested in any domain of fitness, exercise physiology, recovery, etc. Wodcast manages to cover highly specific subjects while remaining funny and easy to listen to. You also get a good balance of elite athlete / professional perspectives and the widely accessible standpoint of Eddie.
Favorite episode: (a) Chris Hinshaw and (b) Kelly Starret episodes."
706,The WODcast Podcast,Wish there was less fluff,2,Too much random convo unrelated to health and fitness. Wish we dove more into the nitty gritty of some of these athletes and the regimen/nutrition/etc
707,The WODcast Podcast,Great Podcast,5,"I really want to leave a crappy review for Eddie to destroy, as that is very entertaining, but it would all be lies. I love stand-up comedy, CrossFit, OCR, and general fitness, and this podcast touches on all of those things at various points. I laugh, and I learn. Keep it up!"
708,The WODcast Podcast,Love the podcast,5,The recent evolution to solo has been great. One of my top 3 podcasts.
709,The WODcast Podcast,Great podcast!,5,"I recently had a six hour drive and I asked a FB group for recommendations. This one was mentioned several times so I gave it a whirl. Great content, love the guests and Eddie is hilarious! Made the hours cruise by...I listened the whole way home!"
710,The WODcast Podcast,Best podcast out there,5,Eddie is hilarious! Keep doing your thing!
711,The WODcast Podcast,Long time listener,5,"I‚Äôve been a listener for a long time. Eddie does a great job, at times I miss the whole crew but at least they don‚Äôt talk about comic books anymore. The episodes with hunter are probably the best, maybe hunter should be the new co-host. #stilllistening"
712,The WODcast Podcast,My All-Time favorite podcast!,5,"Been a listener since this podcast was about two months old. It‚Äôs evolved through the years and even though I‚Äôm not big on change, somehow this show has managed to get better with every evolution. Love all the past hosts but Eddie, your killing it as a solo. Keep up the great work as always!
Alex"
713,London Real,David Icke,5,David icke hit way too close to the truth and that‚Äôs why you got banned on YouTube . You were being neutral the whole time how dare they ban you . Keep the truth coming !
714,London Real,David ICKE 1&2,5,Exceptional. Bravo on the interview Brian. And bravo to the Army. I am a fan and supporter. Truth will prevail.
715,London Real,5stars,5,"Thought provoking and inspiring content from various guests and host, Brian. Very grateful to have stumbled upon this show."
716,London Real,Inspiring stuff,5,Great guests and host
717,London Real,"Great Job, Brian!!",5,"Man the balls you have to risk shutting down your whole business to just talk about the truth is inspiring and courageous. Keep it up, you have a new fan."
718,London Real,Your courage,5,"Straight up, there aren‚Äôt a lot of people willing to speak the truth and stand up. I was never a frequent listener of this podcast until I heard David Icke episode and I am hooked and have an immense respect for both of them! Thank you"
719,London Real,David Icke,5,"I love your interview with David Icke.
Came to download the second interview, and it‚Äôs not here. Saw it was taken out of your website. YouTube needs to allow freedom of the press. You‚Äôre great host Brian, really enjoy your interviews."
720,London Real,He lets his guests do the talking,5,He has mastered the art of allowing his guests to speak their minds. A rarity these days
721,London Real,Brian‚Äôs the GOAT,5,"Brian made this podcast the best, thank you Brian if you are reading this. Such an inspiration."
722,London Real,A promising start but eventually falls short,3,"London Real was on a great course but podcasts have fallen short in the last year due to questionable guests. Brians interview skills are also fall short, often letting guests ramble on crazy long tangents and never challenging his guests no matter how crazy some of them get. The podcast has become disappointing in that Brian is constantly trying to bait more and more people to sign up for his podcasting classes, promising income. The reality is, most podcasters do it for the love. Those who make money from podcasts are few and far between and most successful podcast hosts such as Brian, Lewis Howes, Joe Rogan, etc... made their $$$ from other careers. Again, this show started strong but has lost its potency over the last year. Hopefully 2020 will be a comeback year."
723,London Real,Generous three stars,3,"I‚Äôm a pretty new listener to LR and even though I get quite a bit out of listening, some things just irk me about the podcast. One being the tireless self-promotion. I understand that he has to pay the bills and all, but my god, the first ten minutes are all blah, blah, blah. Another thing is that the interviews are edited in such a way that sometimes you‚Äôre wonder if you missed something. One last one: he always asks ‚Äúone last question‚Äù, and after he asks it he cuts to, you guessed it, self promotion and completely cuts out the answer. Why bother airing the question if you‚Äôre not going to play the answer? Like I said, I get quite a bit out of what is there, but I can tell it could be so much better. And I‚Äôm not about to pay a subscription fee to get what I‚Äôm missing. I have my regular podcasts that I listen to that have the quality that I‚Äôm accustomed to, and if they‚Äôve not already interviewed a certain person I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt be long until they will. ‚úåüèª"
724,London Real,Total Scam Artist DON'T DO HIS COURSE!,1,"I was a big fan of the London Real until I did the Business Accelerator Course with them. It went from bad to worse and then hit a level that even shocked me.
At first, I thought it was just me that was disappointed, but it did not take long for more to feel the same way. It became so many people we had another FB private group called FLR.
Funny enough, that was the best part of the course. Through our private group, we were able to chat, share information, and bond as we were not being babysat or monitored the whole time by his ""coaches.""
Currently, over 130 of us from the class are seeking reimbursement from our credit card companies and speaking with different scam associations. We were forced to do this because LR will NEVER return one of your emails unless it is about buying another course"
725,London Real,"Great , But",5,"Amazing Show, but on their app you can‚Äôt download audio. So you have to go to their app to watch part two but can‚Äôt download audio. Frustrating. Show is absolutely amazing but app does not work great and can‚Äôt download. I‚Äôd pay $ to be able to download whole show"
726,London Real,"Great content, but...",3,"I‚Äôve listened to few podcasts and have enjoyed the content. I do want to express my distaste for what my gut reaction called ‚Äúbeing hijacked‚Äù. In the interview with Dr. Joe Dispenza, after an hour and a half of listening, the good Dr. begins to dispense the pearls, only to be interrupted with a voice over stating that in order to hear what he has to say you have to got the website and register. That sucked all the air out of what had been great, until that point. That made the whole thing feel like a scam."
727,London Real,Mixed feelings,3,"I have mixed feelings about this podcast. Although I find many of the guests to be questionable or superficial, there have been guests that seem to be the real deal i.e. Dan Pena, Marisa Peer, Philip McKernan, Dr. Joe Dispenza, Jordan Peterson, just to name a few. I sense there are episodes that have been removed and there are 2 min previews because the intention is for people to go onto the website and pay for one of their subscription plans to view the videos. I find that to be a bit greedy."
728,London Real,The flat earth discussion,1,"The two of you sound like boring intellectuals (in your own mind) using your big ‚Äúpurple words‚Äù to cast aspersions on those that you think are far below your ‚Äútruth and understanding.‚Äù
You talk down to the audience when talking about the flat plane we live on. There are only 8 ‚Äúpictures‚Äù of the spherical earth in existence and they are all ‚Äúartist renditions‚Äù of the ‚Äúball earth.‚Äù Do you really really believe we are zooming through space at thousands of miles per hour while rotating on our axis and so on...?
Copernicus‚Äôs theory was quickly adopted by the evil Roman Catholic Church to drive mAn from their individual relationship with God back to the ‚Äúchurch‚Äù the only authority on such matters. Science slowly started to replace religion and separated man further from it‚Äôs Creator all by design. Earth is no longer the center of the universe and then we get the ‚ÄúBig Bang theory‚Äù which tells man that God did not create the heavens and the earth. It was just an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù of nature.
Most people don‚Äôt even realize that none of the pictures of the planets in our galaxy are real either. It is all CGI. Then comes the ridiculous ‚Äútheory of evolution.‚Äù Which further confuses man in that God did not create earth or the heavens and He did not even create us! The so called ‚Äútheory of evolution‚Äù has been disproven but you won‚Äôt hear about that.
It has all been part of a long thought out plan for the ‚Äúcontrollers‚Äù the ‚ÄúKabala‚Äù the ‚Äúelites‚Äù who actually think they are above average man in intellect when in reality most of them amassed their fortunes by trampling over small businesses, forming monopolies, and I won‚Äôt even get started on the ‚Äúbankers‚Äù and their ‚Äúdebt system‚Äù of currency.
From Ford, to the Bushes, to the Morgan‚Äôs, to the Wallburg, to the Rothchild‚Äôs, to the Royal Family and so on to the Bilderbergers etc etc.
The commen people are serfs or slaves to their system they put in place. They further broke up the family unit with drugs especially to African American men, pornography to the point that there are now like 80 different ‚Äúgenders‚Äù you can identify as on any given day. We have drag queens reading to elementary students and discussing gender to them.
Anyone that does not see this being well along the path of the ‚Äúbeginning of the end of man‚Äù has to have blinders on. Destruction is coming to the flat plane of our existence and you two sit there talking with your noses up in the air like you are above all this nonsense.
By the way, none of what I have written is ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù(a term invented by the CIA to discredit anyone who dares to think outside the box we are all in. These are the facts whether you snooty ignorant pie holes agree or not."
729,London Real,A good replacement,5,"Over the years I‚Äôve listened to C2C for my fix on UFOs, paranormal and related subjects. However, that show has gone way off track even including infomercials. Because of that I began my search for a replacement and I am so happy to have found this podcast. It‚Äôs everything C2C used to be and then some. I particularly appreciate how they focus on the things that are of interest to me paranormal, conspiracy and ufology. I know that when I start a new podcast it will be within those parameters. Please please keep up the good work and never deviate from the format. Very entertaining!"
730,London Real,Incredibly annoying YouTube commercials,3,His invasive YouTube commercials that interrupt my viewing make me want to smash his face in. At first I thought he was the Wolf of Wall Street. But the show is actually OK. Graham Hancock was why I gave it a chance.
731,London Real,Grown and keeps growing,5,"I‚Äôve listened to London Real for years. I‚Äôve met Brian and have seen his life transform as well as the show develop through time. While I don‚Äôt resonate with every guest, I have learned from a lot of the guests on the show and follow their work. In my personal life, my relationship with my spirituality, health, and well being have also changed. It hasn‚Äôt always been a steady incline, but much like Brian, the guests, and the show, I learn and continue to move forward. May the show continue to transform the lives of those who want to change and may Brian and his team be blessed with all they dreamed of, so that they can continue to do this work."
732,London Real,Awesone Podcast!!!,5,"Brian, host of the London Real podcast, highlights all aspects of interesting, influential people and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
733,London Real,My top podcast,5,Thank you Brian for being such an open minded awesome interviewer and having guests on that are doing amazing things for the world much love my friend!
734,London Real,Great show,5,I catch every episode. Always excellent and thoughtful content.

738,London Real,Amazing!!,5,"I love the interviews, great people, very inspiring..."
739,London Real,Finally Podcast with Purpose,5,"Thank you so much for this amazing podcast, I love to watch on YouTube and listen while I am at the gym ... thanks that helps a lot"
740,London Real,Love the podcast version,5,"I love this show. Can you interview Jon Kabat-zinn please, he‚Äôs got a lot to say."
741,London Real,Definitely prefer Deep,5,From podcast 34. I definitely enjoy the deep conversations most. One reason is because I don‚Äôt currently get this in my life. I truly appreciate what you both are doing and please continue bring these deep thought provoking conversations. Love y‚Äôall!! Come to Georgia in the U.S.!!!
742,London Real,Brilliant trade teacher,5,This podcast is something I did not expect it to be like. I thought I would learn about what trading is and how to get success in this field. But I learnt much more and much deeper than just the process of earning hundreds and thousands and may be even millions of money. Everybody trying to get into trading or even investing must listen to this podcast.
743,Life Habits,Love the length and the content!!,5,"It was so fun for me to come across this podcast! I couldn't decide which episode to listen to first. I thoroughly enjoyed one about optimizing travel and Karel hit on all the vital points! Thanks for reminding me of the importance of keeping it simple, how to help avoid worst case scenario, and tips for traveling with enjoyment! I look forward to more!"
744,Life Habits,Love This Podcast!,5,Karel's podcast is excellent! Very inspiring and his guest always have valuable information for motivation. You will love this podcast! Karel has a great background in Clinical Psychology and provides fantastic insight to creating positive life habits. Thanks for this Karel!

748,Life Habits,Great show,5,üëç great way to start the day.
749,Life Habits,Great,5,My favorite podcast. Excellent advice and ideas delivered in a very pleasing and efficient manner. I very much enjoy re-listening to the ones that I find most helpful.
750,Life Habits,Good content,3,"The podcast has a good content, but is there a reason why the host says particuRar and reguRarly instead of particular and regularly? English isn't my first language, so this gets really confusing and I end up losing focus on the content and picking up these errors as he speaks and it kinda defeats the purpose. Please Mr host, speak more clearly and without these mistakes, it gets really annoying after a while, especially because you say the word ""particuRar"" quite often and I lose track of content every time that happens. Other than that, I definitely recommend this podcast, he has good advice and really know what he is talking about!"
751,Life Habits,Best podcast eve r!!!,5,"I love this podcast! It's informative, it's fun, easy to follow, and the notes provided on the website lifehabits.net are incredibly useful."
752,Life Habits,Positive and inspiring daily advice on a wide range of life topics,5,"Great motivational guidance for the individual trying to find solutions to their everyday challenges in relationships, in the workforce,and most importantly internally. I have suggested this podcast to my entire family, kids included,(although they have not taken my suggestion yet, I am hopeful) as almost all of the podcasts you will find something applicable to your life, either directly or indirectly."
753,Life Habits,My favorite podcast,5,"I commute 2 1/2 hours a day, so I've listened to many podcasts. This one is, hands-down, my favorite. I've listened for more than a year. The material is relevant, insightful & entertaining. I appreciate the time & work put in on it. The episodes have greatly helped ease my commute & improve my personal life habits. Thank you!"
754,Life Habits,Relaxing and uplifting,5,These podcasts are full of little tips that will help make each of your days better. Each podcast is a nice soothing session that leaves you with ideas about how you can improve your life. Karl has a very calming voice which leaves you feeling relaxed at the end of each session. This is excellent to listen to while you are trying to unwind at the end of a stress filled day.
755,Life Habits,Amazing,5,"The most professional and helpful podcast out there, just amazing how generous Karel is. This is my first review for any of podcasts, prompted by the level of quality of advice and the genuine concern for us, humans, who are just trying to deal with life day by day. It should be advertised on CNN and in public schools. No nonsense, nothing promotional, just wisdom from a brilliant researcher based on his experience and study."
756,Life Habits,Love Life Habits,5,I am so glad I stumbled on these podcasts! Karl you are fantastic and I love your voice. It is so soothing and I am able to decompress with it. Thank you for such great podcasts. I am in the process of downloading all of them so I can hear them over and over again. Each one seems to hit on what I need to hear at the time I need to hear it. Thank you! Keep up the great work!
757,Life Habits,One of the best,5,"Karl V's LifeHabits programs are very well composed. Although he has a wealth of experience, he relies on researched findings to support his suggestions and techniques. The programs are well organized and flow in a logical and thoughtful sequence. Very few digressions; very few ""war stories;"" and very very little preaching. Karl V includes helpful suggestions on how to implement the ideas (habits) he discusses in each podcast. A 5 star presentation.

The wealth of insights, quotes, and practical wisdom delivered with a warm, calming tone really resonate with me. I plan to listen again and again to some of the podcasts. They are making a difference for me."
764,Life Habits,Good content,4,"There are lots to be learned from this podcast. I like the ideas being expressed and the host is evidently a well adjusted person with good things to impart. Now for
My only gripe i wish the speaker sounds more human. He kind of sounds robotic. His conversations don't flow well making me wonder if he is a windows narrator programmed to read. Strange because if not for that it is a good podcast. He needs to sound more excited i think."
765,Life Habits,Great App!,5,Look forward to positive re-enforcement!
766,Life Habits,Great podcast,5,I think everyone should listen to this podcast. There is so much good about it that anyone can learn something.
767,Life Habits,Great Habits for everyday living,5,Karel's got a great voice for podcasting and always delivers insightful ideas for ways to improve daily living. The older episodes have some sound issues with guests but all of the information is good and sound quality has gotten much better as the episodes have gone on.
768,Life Habits,Excellent Podcast and Content,5,Excellent Podcast that truly adds value!
769,Life Habits,Easy to Listen To,5,"After dropping my child off at school, I do about a 30-40 minute walk while listening to this podcast so I usually can get in a complete show. I am often inspired but also overwhelmed at how much I am not doing to the best of my ability. Mr Vredenburg is a super-human being who seems to have had a good, nurturing upbringing which has helped make him who he is today. Thank you for sharing your gifts."
770,Life Habits,Wonderful and Helpful and calming!,5,What a great find to hear Karel speak about each subject! Im going to listen to all of these podcasts. Thank you so much!
771,Life Habits,Honest review,5,"I really enjoy this podcast. The content offered is rich, but also simple, practical, and relatable. I listen to several podcasts on various topics but this is the only one I have taken the time to review because of its authentic and anti-gimmick approach."
772,Life Habits,Soothing and helpful!,5,"I have recently discovered these podcasts, and I love to listen to them while I work out. The tone and approach are perfect; I feel they're personable and practical, without the often off-putting tone of so many self-help podcasts out there. Thank you for all you do!"
773,Fasting Talk,Why do you all hate Jimmy?,5,"I think Jimmy has great humor, compassion, and love in every episode he does whether it‚Äôs on this podcast or any of the many others he does. I‚Äôm only on episode 3 but I can‚Äôt believe all the bad reviews. Wish this podcast had more episodes."
774,Fasting Talk,Love the Content - Jimmy needs to let people talk,3,"The content of the podcast is great. Jimmy interupts to the point where the podcast is almost unlistenable. Stop trying to make jokes, let people answer the questions you ask. I see Jimmy as the moderator of the podcast, however, he can't let people get a full answer out. Get a different moderator."
775,Fasting Talk,Rude sexist host,1,"Wow! Host is obnoxious, sexist and rude. His jokes are sooooo lame! This guy is awful and need to be replaced ASAP"
776,Fasting Talk,"Sorry, just can‚Äôt listen to this!",1,I wanted so bad to like all his podcast cause I‚Äôve heard about him so much but I just can‚Äôt take it. He constantly interrupts people and it always sounds so condescending when he talks. Like he thinks he‚Äôs better than every one else. I‚Äôve listened to his other podcasts and they are all the same.
777,Fasting Talk,Excellent!,5,Fantastic show! Love Jimmy! Love Megan! I am 20 pounds down!
778,Fasting Talk,Jimmy too disruptive to valuable info,1,"I listened to episode 11, but couldn‚Äôt take Jimmy Moore interruptions. Seemed to pick the most inappropriate times to insert music or jokes. It was rude. It‚Äôs a wonder that he never noticed no one but him laughed."
779,Fasting Talk,Jimmy is an Idiot and Rude- too bad because,4,"There is some really interesting and valuable information that both Dr. Fung and Megan have to impart.
Agree with other reviewer that Jimmy is condescending to Megan and that‚Äôs why I stopped listening in 2017.
Am going to try again. Personally, I‚Äôve maintained a 40 lb weight loss for over six years using some element if fasting and nothing more. I am a big believer in it and now want to get the benefits if extended fasts. Ditch Jimmy and get another host for this great and important podcast!"
780,Fasting Talk,Host to annoying and condescending to women,1,"Jimmy is so rude and disparaging to Megan even if he does it through humor. He doesn‚Äôt talk to Jason that way. Also, laughing at everyone of his own poor taste jokes is so frustrating. I‚Äôm out and moving onto the obesity code. Jimmy over shadows any valuable content and motivation you might get from this podcast."
781,Fasting Talk,Shut ALL the way up Jimmy!!!,4,"Great content, but Jimmy is such a doofus! Soooo irritating, childish and completely corny. Man, he‚Äôs the worst."
782,Fasting Talk,Awesome podcast!,5,"My only complaint is that it ended too early. There‚Äôs nothing better to listen to while I‚Äôm fasting, or even when I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs a great show with lots of great information and inspiration. I wish there were more episodes but I‚Äôm thankful for the ones there are and will continue to listen to them in repeat."
783,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Everything you need to know!,5,"Dr. Romm covers topics from Covid19 to endometriosis to detoxification and everything in between.

788,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Awesome Podcast!,5,"I just discovered this podcast, it‚Äôs absolutely amazing! Dr. Aviva Romm is so knowledgeable and I can relate so much!"
789,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",key health information explained understandably,5,"I've listned to plenty of podcast that give functional and integrative medicine aspects, but related to athletes. Though they are science base, I really appreciate that Dr. Romm can educate on this side of health with a medical background as well. She also has a wonderful way of educating in a manner we can all understand. She empowers woman to not be ashamed to address the health need with their pracitioners. Noting that we often play it down as not to seem too needy or ""hypochondriac"". She gets that in traditional medicine the issues are so often missed and we need to look further. Thank you Aviva. I've learned alot and have felt validated."
790,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",The future of our health is integrated!,5,Dr. Aviva weaves conventional and integrative medicine together in a way that is easy to understand and very supportive to women and families. I‚Äôm an acupuncturist working in an integrative Medicine clinic and often refer my patients to her show! Thank you Dr. Aviva for paving the way to empowered medical care that gets us connected back to ourselves!!
791,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Very smart information,5,You can tell the host is well prepared as she shares a wealth of knowledge to her listeners. Thank you.
792,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Diving Deeper into Root problems,5,"Aviva has a beautiful way of respecting women‚Äôs bodies, and diving deeper in women‚Äôs health. I am currently in a traditional physician assistant program which doesn‚Äôt see the connection between the whole body and root causes of health conditions. It has been helpful listening to her podcasts, and knowing in a deeper way that we can HEAL and take back our health..and don‚Äôt have to give over our bodies willingly to the health care system. Taking charge of one‚Äôs health and loving oneself is a empowering message Aviva puts out within her podcasts and blog posts. I would recommend this podcast to everyone!"
793,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Aviva, host of the Natural MD Radio podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
794,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Review of vaccination episode,3,"I have deep respect for you and your work. Your Naturally Healthy Babies and Children book has been my go to resource for at home care. Thank you! I do want to respond to your recent episode on vaccines. While I can appreciate where you are coming from, I feel that you did not equally represent both sides of the debate. There is a plethora of mounting scientific evidence that suggests the ingredients in vaccines are causing an epidemic of chronic illness in our children, neurological disorders and learning disabilities. The Autism debate has hardly been settled as the only study ever performed by the government was the MMR study that a senior scientist at the CDC revealed was pointing to a causal relationship between the vaccine and autism. He further divulged that the scientists involved in this study were instructed to destroy the documents that showed this connection. MMR was the only vaccine looked at in relationship to autism and the entirety of the vaccine schedule has never been tested for it‚Äôs synergistic effect in the body. Couple this with the fact that there are no true double-blind placebo studies with a saline placebo for any vaccine and the picture becomes clear that there is (inexcusable) inadequate safety studies on vaccines. The conspiracy you were never invited to be a part of would not be a conspiracy that most doctors would be aware of. Medical schools are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. My father, grandfather, husband and brother-in-law are doctors and their studies of vaccinations in medical school were limited to memorizing the CDC vaccination schedule and being indoctrinated with the ‚Äúvaccines are safe and effective‚Äù mantra. The regulatory agencies in our county are owned by industry with a revolving door between the CDC, FDA, and HHS with pharmaceutical companies. ACIP recommendations are made by doctors that more often than not have conflicts of interest and are influenced by employees of vaccine manufacturers who are allowed to participate in closed door meetings. Three things need to happen right now. The immunity granted to the pharmaceutical companies in the 1986 National Vaccine Injury Act that removed liability from their products needs to be revoked so there is incentive to create safer vaccines. Second, industry must be separated from our regulatory agencies. Lastly, a vaccinated vs. unvaccinated study needs to be performed comparing the health outcomes of both groups. Until this happens, it is impossible and inaccurate to state that 99.9% of children do great with vaccines.
I encourage you to read the White Papers created by ICAN, the Stanford trained physiologist Dr. Theresa Deisher‚Äôs open letter on dangers of the MMR vaccine, the pro-vaccine John Hopkins pediatric neurologist Andrew Zimmerman‚Äôs affidavit, the Harvard Pilgrim study revealing less than 1% of vaccine injuries are reported to VAERS, Dr. Peter Abay‚Äôs research on the devastating effects of the DTP vaccine, Robert F Kennedy Jr‚Äôs research on vaccines, and the lawsuit involving MERK‚Äôs fraudulent MMR vaccine, to start. In the future I‚Äôm hoping you will present the scientific data from both sides of the debate. Thank you!"

796,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Informational,5,I‚Äôve learned so much and enjoy listening!
797,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Informative and Empowering!,5,"Dr. Aviva Romm is my go-to for medical advice I can trust for myself and my young child. I wish I could call her up every time I have to make a medical decision for me or my son, but luckily she made this podcast which is (almost) as helpful.
Dr. Aviva you are a such a sane, comforting voice in a world of chaotic, fear based chatter! Thank you!
PS thank you especially for the vaccine episode, it was so helpful."

It‚Äôs so very helpful to receive this information on how to support our health through a holistic approach combining diet, lifestyle, supplements, herbs and when needed, pharmaceuticals. I so appreciate you sharing your vast knowledge base to help women feel empowered to take back their health!"
799,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Informative and helpful,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for a little over a month now. I have had problems with follicular cyst on my ovaries each month after getting off of the pill. I was suggested only to start taking a birth control again to suppress ovulation and prevent another cyst from forming. I was displeased with the solution, and began my own research.
It was the second episode I listened to that gave me a list of herbs to try for managing pain and regulating my hormones. I luckily have a trusty vitamin and supplement shop very close to where I live. I walked in there and found an amazing blend of the herbs I had been looking for! Within 2 days the pain started to ease. Now 1 month in a feel pain maybe 3 or 4 times a month. Before I was experiencing chronic pain all day everyday. I‚Äôm so very thankful for this podcast! I‚Äôm learning so much on how to heal my body naturally. I appreciate such pure information that is free and accessible. I can say the information given on this podcast has helped me regain my confidence in healing my body.
Thank you so much for what you do!"
800,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Brilliant mind and pleasant voice,5,"I am listening to Episode 57 again. Dr. Aviva Romm is brilliant and so skilled at explaining complex medical concepts for the citizen scientist who‚Äôs just trying to find some answers for their own health. Also, her voice is super nice to listen to. So good!"
801,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Binge this podcast,5,"Can you binge listen to a podcast? Because that is what I just did.
If you have a vagina or even know someone with a vagina, you need to listen to this podcast. Dr. Romm is the MD we all want, she is smart, compassionate, kind and has zero time for misogynistic B.S. Yes- you will fall in love with her, I‚Äôm gonna warn you now."
802,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",I‚Äôm hooked,5,Highly recommend this podcast!
803,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Thank you Dr Aviva!,5,"Thank you so much Dr Aviva for being so generous with your knowledge and expertise. This is information we all need to regain and maintain our health. I believe you are a pioneer and I hope this is the kind of care we will all have access to at our physician‚Äôs office and health clinics someday. Until then, I will turn to you‚ù§Ô∏è"

Not to mention I wish I could just have a cup of coffee with her (well, maybe holy basil tea!) Thank you, Aviva!"
806,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Excellent Podcast,5,"I get so excited when I see a new podcast out from Dr. Romm.

I cannot wait for every episode it‚Äôs like therapy to me and I really feel her genuine soul ! I almost bi passed this not thinking the image portrayed was what I was looking for (so professional lol) and I am so so glad I did . So much reaasurement on ideals I believe in . . Thank you so much !
810,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",Always informative!,5,Once again Dr Romm provides excellent information regarding a topic very rarely discussedb. Definitely worth listening to!
811,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better",A Woman‚Äôs Miracle,5,"Dr. Aviva is not only extremely knowledgeable about women‚Äôs overall health, she is able to recommend natural remedies for particular concerns. It is clear she knows her stuff, she is not a ‚Äúband-aid‚Äù type of Doctor, she wants you to help find the roots and address these issues head on. Thank you for all the tools and knowledge you have blessed us with thus far!"
812,"Natural MD Radio | Feel better, Live better","On time and let‚Äôs not forget, Natural!",5,"First off, thanks SO much to Aviva for taking the time to explain health and medicine to her listeners. I found this podcast at the perfect time: I‚Äôm learning all about cervical healing all while decreasing my anxiety and stress levels (again, can‚Äôt thank her enough). What can I say?... in depth explanations to health issues and concerns-that I unfortunately am not always able to have in a doctor‚Äôs office- and evidence based, sincere approaches to health. As a lover of natural healing, I wholeheartedly appreciate the natural approach. Patiently waiting on episode 104! Great listening, Powerful learning! Peace and Love üå±"
813,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Dr. Drew is the Best!,5,"Dr. Drew won me over in the 90‚Äôs on Loveline with his compassionate, non judgemental approach. I grew up in a medical household and know that many healthcare practitioners can be judgemental which, in my experience, is why many people don‚Äôt seek medical help when they might need it.
I am a big fan of all of his work - I always learn something new and have a broader perspective afterward. I have developed a new compassion for addicts and the homeless crisis after hearing his perspective from decades in the field."
814,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Dr. Drew ‚Äî so disappointed!,1,"I am so disappointed in Dr. Drew‚Äôs irresponsible reporting during coronavirus pandemic.
Apologizing, while important, does not divest oneself from responsibility, amends do that.
In his Periscope video, from yesterday, he said he kept saying to follow the CDC. Well, Dr. Nancy Messioner, of the CDC, said on Tuesday, February 25, 2020, it was ‚Äúnot if, but when‚Äù the coronavirus would be spread in The United States. I am unclear as to what guidance he was looking at from the CDC. I used to think he did such good things and good work, but getting it wrong on something so major and seemingly so obvious, has caused me to unsubscribe and not want to listen to any ‚Äúwisdom or advice‚Äù coming from him."
815,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,YOU LIVE!!,5,"Can‚Äôt we get LOVE LINE BACK!! Dr Drew and Mike Catherwood changed my life show had the perfect balance of education, positive influence to hilarity! PLEASE MAKE IT WORK COME BACK FOR US!!!üôèüèº"
816,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Cool show,5,I like this show for the focus on addiction related topics but sometimes Bob makes me want to turn it off bc I don‚Äôt like his ‚Äúgrandpa know it all‚Äù vibe... but dr drew makes it work
817,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,You live,2,"Please Susan Pinsky talk to Bob . The Bob show, laughs at his own jokes and talks over everyone. He is like millennial"

819,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Where‚Äôd it Go???,5,"What happened to this podcast?
Liked it weekly with Bob, loved the Catherwood episodes, and thought the recent Dave episodes were awesome as well.

821,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,When you market activism,5,"Hello
To respond to why it‚Äôs problematic that companies are using their activism as a branding mechanism- this takes them off the hook for engaging in a deeper way-it‚Äôs extremely passive"
822,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Susan is really hard to listen to,1,"Please don‚Äôt make us listen to your wife....your audience have nothing in common with her. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs a great wife and mom but she doesn‚Äôt belong on the podcast, she‚Äôs just not good at it."

826,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Today‚Äôs podcast,3,"Dr. Drew is simply fabulous. Always. No matter what podcast he is doing. He is the real deal.
The woman Grace who was on the show today was awful. Her voice and contribution was that of a high school valley girl. Annoying to listen to and very out of her league in a podcast with a grown up medical expert like Dr. Drew."
827,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,"Once A Fan, Now Turned Off",1,"I used to really like and respect Dr. Drew, until he started trying to spoon feed us pro-Trump, conservative psycho-babble. Stick to addiction awareness, mental illness and medicine. When he wonders into politics, pretending to be the champion of all voices, while spewing conservative values, it turns me off. It‚Äôs b.s. Dr. Drew should be honest, tell everyone he‚Äôs a Trump supporter, and go beg Fox News for a job.üå∏üå∏üå∏"

833,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Did someone call the police,1,Fullstop. Did someone call the police. This was a podcast on Monday. And what action did you take. Did someone call the police.
834,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,#YouLive,5,Great and getting better and better. Guests and hosts talking about recovery and thriving. Always enjoy listening to them.
835,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,"Game changer, beyond helpful!",5,"As a wife of a newly recovering opioid addict from over prescribed pain meds where I also only recently found out days before getting him in detox (after intervention) this podcast has been my savior! I immediately started to do a ton of research on addiction and opioid prescriptions, and Dr Drew has been a wealth of knowledge helping me understand more about what my husband was and is dealing with. This podcast is part of my ‚Äúprogram ‚Äú, as I am healing, along with therapy, al-anon/group sessions, etc. I am grateful for Dr Drew‚Äôs passion, frustration for the current environment, especially doctors, and breaking down the details and discussing the facts and the myths.
So many great episodes , just listened to #77, another excellent one, including chronic back pain and details of why surgery is a bad idea! Thank you Dr Drew and Bob!"
836,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Love,5,"Love every episode, I keep re listening to all of them! Drew & Bob together are an amazing duo!"
837,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Reel Bob In....,1,"I truly love listening to Drew but it‚Äôs gotten to the point of wanting to unsubscribe from the podcast. Bob is just insufferable. Bob consistently overshadows their guests by answering questions Drew intends for the person they are interviewing. He has always done this but lately it is intolerable. Why have guests on if Bob answers for them?
Bob also interrupts the guest (or Drew) and steps on many stories or points that are compelling.
Many times I‚Äôve just turned the podcast off and moved along to other content because he halts the flow of the conversations.
His laugh is just inappropriate and again just annoying.
Why can‚Äôt you talk to him, Drew (or Susan?)??"
838,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,I should‚Äôve been an addict.,5,I‚Äôm very happy to have found your program Dr. Drew and Bob. As a child I had what you could call a lot of trauma. My father was a mean alcoholic. He beat me routinely with the belt. He beat my mother routinely. I could not have any girlfriends especially those that had brothers for fear I would get pregnant. I was an only child thank goodness. At one point my mother decided to leave my father with me. That made him very very angry. He pick me up at school took me back to his home called my mother and told her he had me and he would not let me go until she came back to him. I also remember asking him what a French kiss was. I think I was around 10 or 11 I‚Äôm not really sure. So instead of verbalizing to me what it is he actually physically showed me. That really stuck with me I am now 71 and I can‚Äôt go put it out of my mind. I‚Äôve never been social. Maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt trust. I‚Äôve always been happy being alone with my dog. Every now and again I do go out with a friend but it‚Äôs very rare. And it doesn‚Äôt bother me to be alone I am I‚Äôm very content. I have no family I have not had family for
839,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Good but for Bob,4,"Bob Forrest would interrupt Einstein and try to explain the atom to him. Talking over everything isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpunk rock‚Äù, it is juvenile."
840,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,More balance,3,"I love Drew and I also love Bob but now I get why Bob has his own show, he‚Äôs constantly talking over everyone and the guests loose their trains of thought but Bob sure gets his words in..."
841,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Love it,5,Love this podcast. Dr Bruce is actually my dr I met in addiction medicine. It‚Äôs nice to hear his views along with bob and dr drew on certain topics!
842,This Life #YOULIVE With Dr Drew,Bob talks to much. Shut up Bob.,1,"I‚Äôm sick of Bob interrupting the guests. Listening to Col. Alan West being interviewed. Frustrating.
because Bob is a loud mouth. Dr Drew is great."

847,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,What about endurance athletes :),5,"Hi JJ!
First off, I want to say how much I LOVE your show and your products and am constantly sending your podcasts to friends.
I understand endurance athletes might not be your target market but there is one thing that keeps popping up episode after episode. You speak about such a wide range of fitness, nutrition and wellness, but multiple times have discouraged endurance training. I am an endurance triathlete whom races in Ironmans and I do it because I love the sport and it makes my soul happy. With that, I also struggle with my weight.
I don‚Äôt want to give up a sport that I love doing but I also refuse to give up on my body, what are some insights you may be able to have for us endurance athletes that also still want to lose weight and be healthy as possible. I know I‚Äôm not the only one out there and not all endurance athletes are as skinny as a rail. How can I continue to do the sport that I love and lose weight as an endurance athlete? :)"

851,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Life Changer!,5,"Dear Team JJ:
My name is Sharon and from Chicago. About six months ago I went to the doctor and received news that made me sad. I was deemed as overweight, suffered from high inflammation, thus the incredible knee pain, and my blood work came back all crazy. I immediately started searching for answers and with the greatest stroke of luck, I found your podcast. I was immediately hooked and promptly started making big changes in my life, namely cutting out processed foods and sugar and adding omega 3‚Äôs and leafy greens. Within weeks brain fog lifted, knee pain went away, and I was losing weight. Honestly, I care about losing weight, but I care more about a healthy heart, body, and mind. I now begin and end my day with a journal of gratitude and have ensured that I get enough sleep each day. I cannot thank you enough for sharing your amazing wealth of knowledge and bringing on guests that have also contributed to my overhaul in life. You are a life saver and I will be forever grateful! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!"

857,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Expert information with no BS,5,"I love this podcast! The information is super-helpful, organized, and the segments are of manageable lengths. (I don‚Äôt always have 90 minutes to listen to an episode!) J.J., what I love most about your approach is that you don‚Äôt use scare tactics or speak in absolutes, as I‚Äôve found to be the case with many other nutrition authors whose main agenda seems to be to sell books. In short, I feel like you are the real deal, and I trust your information. As a chef and menu consultant who helps people with elimination diets, I am totally on board with your customized approach to diet and the benefit of eliminating inflammatory foods. The results are real and long-lasting. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge with us! - Chef Laurie Gauguin"
858,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Good information,4,"I enjoy listening to JJ‚Äôs podcasts and learn a lot and would love to share them with my friends. However, (and the reason for the 4 stars) when I go to her website to get the link they are not there on they day they are aired. It would be great if the podcasts were on her website the day they were posted on iTunes. Also, I would love to hear a show on CBD oil and its benefits. More specifically, why it would help with brain fog. ~ Beverly Spring"
859,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Five Stars,5,Thank you JJ for all the great information! I always learn something new.

862,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Very Knowledgeable Host,5,I love this podcast. JJ has so much information and helps us to apply simple tips to improve health and weight. The host has so much knowledge to share with her listeners.
863,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Awesome Podcast,5,I am a physical therapist who is interested in all aspects of health and find this Podcast so informative and inspiring. I have developed a much healthier relationship with food since I started listening and incorporating principles into my daily life. I am also very tall (6‚Äô1‚Äù tall) and now weigh 158lbs (previously 170lbs). I am stronger and leaner at age 51 then I was in my thirties when I ran everyday but ate crap. Thank you and please keep the podcasts coming!
864,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Keep it going!,5,"Hi JJ
You are so knowledgeable, empowering and always motivating me to do better. Question, I am 52 years old and have been working out since I was 11 years old. I did HIIT training 5 days a week for one hour and constantly sore so recently, I switched to 3 days a week and incorporating Hot Yoga Vinyasa for 60-90 minutes. At my age is this better for my fitness goals and longevity? How are our bones, muscles and metabolism effected by fitness at this age and in our elder years. I hope this makes sense? Thank you JJ

865,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Love to listen!,5,"I really enjoy listening to this podcast, thank you JJ and team for all the helpful knowledge on how to reclaim health and wellness.

866,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Thank you!,5,"My mom recommended I listen to this episode and you shared so many amazing gems, thank you! My mom and I did Arbonne‚Äôs 30 days to healthy living together and the cleanse is focused on exactly everything you are sharing here. I think you would love it!"
867,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,"LAWD, I‚Äôve been missing out!",5,"CONCISE, RELEVANT & CONSISTENT!!! I send this podcast to my fam in our group chat and I can‚Äôt wait to read her books! üíöüíöüíö. I enjoy loving on my body to make sure that it is in optimal health. I was brought to the show by a different show and I‚Äôm just so glad that I gave it a go!!! Thanks JJ!"
868,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Thank goodness!,5,"I have been looking for an informative podcast on health and nutrition with this level of intelligence and honesty. The topics are up to date, easily applicable, and not a blatant sales pitch. Her guests are real experts in their fields. Thank you so very much for providing this podcast!"
869,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,"This show is the perfect companion to your eye-openning, books!",5,"Dear JJ,
I love your podcast. It‚Äôs the perfect companion to your eye-opening, life changing books!
I first saw you on PBS, discussing The Sugar Impact Diet. Everything you said made so much sense to me.
Since then, I‚Äôve lost thirty pounds and have kept it off for almost 2 years!! I no longer need to lose weight. Can‚Äôt say that about anything else I‚Äôve done to maintain my weight. AND I‚Äôm 58 years-old! I feel like I‚Äôve found the Holy Grail!!! I have cut so many bad habits (Splenda, diet soda, gluten, etc.).
I bought and USE my XISER.
Keep up the great work on the show. You and your guests inspire me to be the best I can be!!"
870,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,JJ is on top of her game!,5,"I‚Äôve been following JJ since The Virgin Diet. I‚Äôm a Nurse, and I think the medical field is behind the times when it comes to nutrition and weight loss. I will read something in a medical journal and think, this is old news, JJ talked about this last year! I love that you practice what you preach. I love the variety of guests on the show, who have something super interesting to tell us. Even if it doesn‚Äôt pertain to you, you know someone it does pertain to. This podcast has opened my eyes to things I thought were close to a hoax, like tapping, or essential oils. Before you judge, try them. There is something to all this stuff. My favorite part, of course, is the science rational. I love to hear how and why something works. It just makes sense. I appreciate and learn something from every episode. Thank you for teaching the world about nutrition and everything that goes along with it."
871,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,All things sensible for better health!!,5,Great short simple podcast sets that keep me learning new things about health! Love it!
872,JJ Virgin Lifestyle Show,Knowledge is power!,5,"I spent about 10 years going through menopause, diagnosed with an enlarged thyroid, having thyroid removed, suffering through all the poor health as a result. I wanted to give up at age 58. I decided I was just ‚Äúold‚Äù. After a long road of searching for answers and doctor after uninformed doctor, I finally landed with a wonderful functional medicine doctor. She looked over my extensive file and listened so intently. Then she spoke words that changed my life, ‚ÄúTracey I believe the root of your issues is not so much thyroid as food allergies!‚Äù Then she recommended your book and your elimination diet. I started immediately and WOW WOW WOW what a difference! Gluten and dairy are my enemies. Thank you JJ for getting this info out there in such an amazingly applicable format! You, along with Dr. Leaseburge, have given me back my life! I‚Äôm a forever fan of yours!"
873,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Love this podcast,5,"From the entertaining and informative banter at the beginning, fun facts, and great contents, it is the perfect combination of information."
874,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Fun informative podcast,5,Miss Brian. Brian is a great interviewer. He researches before the podcast and asks great questions. He is fun and funny and brings out the best in his guests. Very good information. Miss podcast with just Danny. Was never a fan of the kitchen podcast. Sorry. 2 out of 3 ain‚Äôt bad ;)
875,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Too much irrelevant talk,4,"I love Danny and Brian. Have been listening for years, but I cannot STAND the near half hour intro talk about random things that have nothing to do with health/fitness. When they finally DO get into that discussion it‚Äôs fantastic."
876,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Terrible!,1,"Was an awesome podcast! Mandy, or whatever her name is, is a total waste of air time! She has absolutely nothing to add!
Drop her now!
Go back to the old format and topics! Actual keto info!
This is a waste of time now!"
877,The Ketovangelist Podcast,"Um, you know, lack of info...",2,"Wow! I‚Äôm listening to my first episode and I‚Äôm shocked at the 1- lack of professionalism... they make claims and then debunk themselves, because they haven‚Äôt done any research into the topics they are talking about... literally a dramatic difference between the FDA and the CDC, huge difference between Slimfast and Weight Watchers. I‚Äôm now skeptical of whether they have any valuable knowledge at all. And - they talk over each other, use um, aha, you know, etc. Not worth the time!"
878,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Changes,4,"I loved listening to all 3 podcasts separately, I always had at least one playing when I was at the gym. I still love it! The dynamic is of course different than any of the other podcasts that have come together to form this one, but I find that Mandy‚Äôs volume is usually a lot louder than Danny and Brian‚Äôs. I also miss Danny and Brian banter from K.A, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll grow to love the new one."
879,The Ketovangelist Podcast,New format is forlorn.,2,Went from information from professionals to 3 friends on a party line BSing thru the 1hr plus.
880,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Stick to the topic,2,Too many unrelated topics discussed
881,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Great work!,5,Stumbled upon this podcast because of having cross paths with a guest who I respect. I have found the content to be inline with my practices. Look forward to hearing more as this version progresses
882,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Great Info! Be careful!,4,"I‚Äôve always loved your focus on all things Ketogenic! When you said you were broadening your scope of topics this morning, I got a sinking feeling! Please don‚Äôt go too far astray. üò¨"
883,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Keto Life,5,"Your podcast is awesome. When I started to eat the keto way, I was having a hard time wrapping my head around how we eat fat to lose fat. I listened to one of your podcasts or repeated one i really liked everyday driving home from work for a really long time. You give your listeners so much great information, from easy just do it information to the science and diseases we may save ourselves from by cutting out the carbs. Thank you!!"
884,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Great,4,"Brian, love the show. Love to hear scientists talk about their fields of study and all the intricate cellular level mechanics."
885,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Fills my brain with knowledge,5,I cannot say enough great things about the Ketovangelist podcast. I found it through the ketogenic success Facebook group while searching for a better understanding of why a ketogenic diet yields such fantastic results. Brian's interview style is witty and down-to-earth. You owe it to yourself to tune in and be educated.
886,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Keto at its best!,5,"I've been listening to this podcast for over a year now. I listen to other Keto podcasts as well and really appreciate Brian's interview style. He is genuinely interested in his guests and wants to more about them on a personal level, not just what that can offer in the way of information. Brian is brilliant!! The guests are excellent. The information is top notch. Thanks for your passion and commitment to spreading the word and your vast Keto knowledge Brian!"
887,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Dr Limansky podcast,1,Very informative and interesting but there was a lot of clicking during the interview. Like someone was playing w a Rubix cube!! Is someone ADHD!
888,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Mr young,5,Good in-depth scientific discussion of keto.
889,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Too much smalltalk at beginning,3,Brian spends the first 15-20 minutes of each podcast talking about unrelated topics such as the weather. It makes the podcasts too long and not as relevant.
890,The Ketovangelist Podcast,The cheesiest,5,Love this podcast
891,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Awesome Podcast!!,5,"I am new to the Keto lifestyle and this podcast (as well as the Ketovangelist Kitchen podcast) have helped me more than any other source. It is wonderful balance of science, great interviews, keto lifestyle information all while being entertaining and keeping it real. There are several podcasts out there on the Keto lifestyle and this is by far the one I listen to the most!"
892,The Ketovangelist Podcast,I do NOT miss this podcast.,5,"Have listened since the beginning and learn something new each episode. Once you stop being entranced by his sultry voice you can then also enjoy the subject.
He is rock-bottom strict and these are ways you can stay strict yet enjoy eating.... You come away with understanding and renewed dedication from each episode, but thoroughly entertained along the way. Again, this is one of the MUST LISTENS if you are LCHF or Keto....."
893,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Living this new find,5,"I am a new podcast listener and am loving your show. Somehow I stumbled on your Stevia episode (114) about a week after I decided on my own to try a week without stevia (on week 2 now since it went so well). I‚Äôm a nutritionist studying to become an NTP and loved the science you went into regarding how hormones react to zero carb sweeteners, etc. I am in the midst of writing a blog about my experience and will most definitely be referencing your podcast. Keep up the awesome content!!!"
894,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Pure awesomeness!,5,"Hi Brain,
Thank you for your passion, quirky sense of humor and zealot like desire to tech the benefits of keto!
I am a newbie to keto and already feel the mental clarity and steady blood sugar (prior reactive hypoglycemia). I do seem to have issues with low BP. I am taking salt and hydrating so hoping this is temporary. After all, I am only in my first month of Keto!
Keep asking all the right questions to your amazing guests!! You are gifted at breaking down the insanely difficult to bite size understanding!
Christy"
895,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Dr. Ali,5,"Loved the interview. The statin issue is so frustrating. As to sun exposure, up to 20 minutes or longer depending on skin type is not controversial."
896,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Brian rocks Keto,5,Strap in and get schooled on all true aspects of Keto. Brian and his team are educated and dedicated. You can trust üíØ.
897,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Can be difficult to listen to,3,"Brian and Danny. I don‚Äôt know them personally, they seem like cool guys. But this podcast can be difficult to listen to. They sound like school girls with their banter and all the ‚Äúlikes‚Äù that fly every other word. I appreciate their enthusiasm, but it makes the podcasts distracting to the content. I understand it‚Äôs free and I shouldn‚Äôt complain. But I really want to listen to the shows. It‚Äôs just so distracting!"
898,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Awesome Keto podcast,5,Brian does a great job explaining Keto and interviewing experts in the health field. Keep up the great work!
899,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Episode 182,5,Awesome!!!
900,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Changed my quality of life!,5,"For years, I had been hunting down a ghost. I could feel something metabolically wrong in my body, but because I was trim and athletic, doctors dismissed my concerns for years. Finally, my ever growing premenopausal, acid reflux, joint pain, sleep issues, anxiety, hot flashes, and menstrual discomfort are all alleviated! Although I enjoy and learn from each podcast, my favorite guest has been Ben Bickman. Your podcast has provided me with a feeling of community, relevant information, humor, and a great host! I‚Äôm so glad you do what you do!"
901,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Better than I expected,4,"I really like this podcast. I have to admit I almost didn‚Äôt make it through my first episode because I was really turned off by the host‚Äôs intro. He talks really, really fast - like he‚Äôs delivering the small print in a pharmaceutical commercial. I thought there‚Äôs no way I can listen to this for the next 45 minutes! It was super annoying but I stuck it out and I‚Äôm glad I did. As soon as the intro was over, Brian conducted a spot on, informatively interview with the guest. He just needs to lose the intro schtick (IMHO). All the podcasts I‚Äôve listened to since have had equally engaging content (and sadly have also had the schtick). I‚Äôd rate it higher if not for that. But still, if you can get past that, the content is solid."
902,The Ketovangelist Podcast,Ritzfit- So much value in each episode,5,Brain is a wonderful host and extremely knowledgeable about the ketogenic diet. I mostly enjoy the guests he brings on the show to share their stories about how keto has changed their lives for the better. Brian and his guests together offer so much value to listeners who are either interested in keto or are experienced with the lifestyle. Much love to The Ketovangelist Podcast!
903,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)","Good,but it would be better w/o the voice",4,When I listen to it and try to relax/sleep the voice always make me like (Wha?!)so it would be better w/o them.Also I can‚Äôt find the 1/8 hr ones anywhere soooo I‚Äôm pretty curious about where they are ü§®ü§îü§îü§®

906,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",I can't,2,"I can't get past the episode of the cat licking itself. Makes my skin absolutely crawl and I just can't. Also, episodes aren't long enough for my liking. Just not my cup of tea"

let it play from episode to episode as i sleep just because of the creepy voice"
909,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Umm... ok?,3,"I like this podcast, but the sounds are really repetitive and not always relaxing. I enjoy listening to this! It‚Äôs just not very calming."
910,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Rain W/ Thunder,5,I love this episode but every time the thunder bangs I jolt awake. Maybe make the thunder a little lighter in the track. It scares the bejebbes outta me every-time.
911,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Love it.,5,Soothing and helps me fall asleep. I can fall asleep in ten minutes with this podcast.
912,"Sleep with Silk: Nature Sounds (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Love this!,5,"I suffer from insomnia and have a very hard time getting into a deep sleep or a decent sleep for that matter. This podcast, especially the rain episodes, have helped me get into a routine of deeper sleep and stay asleep for longer. I always fall asleep within 15 minutes of turning this on and it has been a huge lifesaver. Thanks for putting these episodes out to help people that could use it! Very grateful!"
913,Latest in Paleo,My Favorite!,5,Where did you go? I loved this podcast!
914,Latest in Paleo,What Happened,3,"The podcast just stopped, did Angelo die?"
915,Latest in Paleo,The Real Deal,5,"Angelo is truly a GIFT to the podcasting world! He gives 150% every interview, does his research, has great guests and has this magical flow to all of his shows. Always keep me interested and super engaged. I LOVE his voice and his authenticity. In fact, if I were to invite anyone over for dinner and talk all night long about food, ancestral health, health policies etc., it would be non other that Angelo C. Thank you Angelo! If hadn't thanked you enough when we met at the Ancestral Health Symposium in Boulder last year. Keep up your great work. Your passion sure shines when you say your first words....."
916,Latest in Paleo,Thoughtful and well organized,5,"Not much more to say. Angelo provokes fair, insightful, and thoughtful conversation on the world of food, nutrition, and culture."
917,Latest in Paleo,Best podcast for whole foods lifestyle,5,"I have listened to all of the Paleo podcasts available, and this one is definitely the best. It is a true pleasure to listen to-- goes way beyond diet, health, and fitness to offer different perspectives on big ideas, but without losing its focus. It is fair, honest, and open-minded. Angelo is an excellent host: the best."
918,Latest in Paleo,The best,5,"Simply the best health and wellness podcast out there, paleo or not."
919,Latest in Paleo,Angelo's commentary is thought provoking...,5,"I've been listening to Latest In Paleo for years now, and I eagerly await each new episode. I'm always amazed that Angelo is able to come up with so many new, thought provoking concepts and the perfect words to relay them. I've enjoyed hearing the evolution of his ideas, his experience, and of his show production even. Such a genuine human, I recommend this show often. Thank you Angelo! Cheers!"
920,Latest in Paleo,Lost focus and sold out,1,"I stopped listening a year or so ago when the show started to drift to a rationalized path to justify why virtually any food type can fit in a template of paleo. I tried it again recently to find the ""plant based paleo"" to be more of the same. Which is to say, if you want to eat potatoes or grains etc... just look for people who have language which sounds scientific to say it's ok. What a failure in continuing to call yourself and your podcast paleo in any meaningful sense. The clincher was the McDougall show. A person who is more of an anti-paleo quack who describes himself as the foremost expert in the world on human nutrition seems like a case in point of double speak."
921,Latest in Paleo,Angelo is THE best out there,5,"I started listening to Latest in Paleo two years back because I needed a solid informative podcast. I sampled everything that is out there and NOTHING and NO ONE compares to Angelo.
This is more than just a paleo ‚Äúdiet‚Äù guide and lifestyle. Angelo will meet and surpass your expectations. This is not just some continuous loop on how ‚Äúgluten‚Äù is toxic and you should eat more bacon ‚Äî and most Paleo podcast are.
In each episode he revisits what it is like to be a human; to enjoy simple things in life, therefore simplifying your diet. His philosophy is essentially a blueprint to our existence.
I love how each episode has an introduction and closing thoughts that are extremely well put, beautifully delivered and has a very lasting impression. Angelo has a soothing, soft voice - a real pleasure to listen to!
You will take away a whole lot of information from each episode and will await impatiently for the next one to be uploaded!
Also, you will get emotionally invested in his family life as well!
Keep at it Angelo, continuous gratitude for making this possible..."
922,Latest in Paleo,Angelo is the real deal and THEN SOME!!!!!,5,"Awesome is an understatement when it comes to his smooth and easy interview style, fantastic production value, open minded approach to various ideologies and the fact that it grabs you from the first minute to the last.
Its a TV show squeezed into a podcast
(Not an advertisement masquerading as information)"

From the vaccination issue to his coverage of 911 first responders health crisis or predicting the real estate collapse years before it happened. Gary is a Renaissance Man, his thorough knowledge of multiple disciplines gives him ""prophetic"" insights. Gary accomplishes more in a 2 hr window than the average man does in full 24 hr day.

954,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Difficult to follow,4,"I do vinyasa power yoga nearly every day and when I went on a trip, I tried to find good podcasts to keep up my practice. While I liked the sequences, I found it harder to follow than other podcasts (lean in, 20 min yoga) I've tried. In all fairness I only tried one episode though."
955,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,NO Flow...,1,"There was no flow... Your teacher BARKs the yoga positions at you. There is no description while you flow into your next posture. The sound quality is Way too soft, and I am not sure if they are giving personal instructions to someone present in the class or if its the next pose. WOW. How this got its rating I have no idea."
956,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Awesome experience,5,"I just came back from my first LLT training module, which this class was a part of. The most powerful 8 days of training I've experienced. Philip and Stacy are gifted teachers. If you want to deepen your Yoga practice consider LLT training."
957,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Hard to follow,1,"I downloaded several of these so I could keep up my practice on vacation.
The ones I downloaded were hard to follow since the instructor was guiding as if I could see them and using unfamiliar terms. Airplane? What asana pose might that be?"
958,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Yoga Talk,4,I love the yoga talk before the class by Phillip at root down yoga! Would love to hear more pre class q and a sessions
959,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Gym Class Yoga,1,"I can only comment on the ""Runga"" episode, as I could barely tolerate a single practice. I should have known when I started hearing the instructor encouraging sighs that I was in store for a canned, poorly executed regurgitation of Baptiste pseudophilosophy. He really needs to stop churning out these would-be life coaches. No human can maintain a consistently deep ujayi pranayama and keep up with the pace of these classes. Especially when half the class is so busy chit chatting and letting out witty quips and non sequitors. Not safe and not yoga."
960,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,lindssmith,4,"Great sequence and excellent workout, but it is sometimes difficult to hear the poses called out and tell whether Phil is giving instructions or calling a new pose or just talking to a student on the side. I wish the audio were a bit clearer. Otherwise, excellent! One of the best yoga podcasts out there."
961,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Thank you for more classes,5,Thank you so much for the new class postings. I look every morning for a new class so thank you for making my morning!
962,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Hot Vinyasa Texas Style,5,"Thank you Stacy! This practice increased awareness of my inner strength, and my body is AWAKE (I practiced at 5:15am). The cues were simple but grounded me consistently during the practice. I enjoyed the intensity mixed with a little light humor from the students in the class. MORE!!!! Can't wait to hear the next class from you! Miss you my friend!
-Donna"
963,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Love these classes!,5,"I attend Baptiste studios in the Boston area when I can, and these podcasts are a wonderful supplement to my home practice! Rock on, Philip! Love your stuff and am so grateful to have found it on iTunes!"
964,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Great Yoga Podcasts,5,"Not for beginners, but absolutely excellent, for body and mind/spirit. Philip does a fantastic job of packing a lot into every class, with both intensity and good humor. I've done a lot of Baptiste Power Vinyasa, and this is the real deal, as good as it gets.
I especially like the hour of power -- any chance we can get a few more of those?
Thanks so much, Philip!"
965,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Best Yoga Podcast!!!,5,"This is my main connection to Baptiste classes! I have traveled extensively to studios around the country and studied many styles of yoga, and I think that Phil is quite possibly the BEST yoga instructor I have ever encountered! With every practice, I feel like I have touched Spirit and been connected directly to Divinity through Phil's voice. I have experienced this from many teachers, but only sporadically, whereas I feel it in Phil's teachings every single class I take, even when I repeat a podcast I‚Äôve heard before! Please, keep the podcasts coming! You have quite a following here in Minnesota!"
966,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,From a tough critic (and seasoned student of yoga),5,"I have been practicing yoga for over a decade, and I am painfully critical of most yoga instruction (painful to me, that is -- I don't actually enjoy being cranky and judgmental) but I really love these classes. At first I thought Philip was kind of full of it, but I quickly changed my mind. I find that his commentary actually inspires me to go beyond my limits, without hurting or exhausting myself, which I tend to do. I confess that I considered the ""Baptiste Power Vinyasa"" brand of yoga to be trendy and superficial, but what can I say? I seem to have been wrong. Hooray!"
967,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Excellent home practice,5,"I am a full time grad student with a full time job so I rarely have time anymore to get to my local studio. I was missing breath work and flow BIG time - how grateful was I to find this amazing podcast. Now I can sweat and flow and go within anytime - and in the comfort of my own home. Thanks to the generosity of Philip Urso I feel like I have been able to bring my practice to another level. And how cool is it that someday, when I have time again!!! I'll be able to get to a live class, since I live in Rhode Island!!! Thank you very much."
968,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Wonderful instruction with humor and peace,5,"I love Philip's classes. They are challenging and fun and I just really like the sound of his voice and the things he says. They are pretty challenging, so not for beginners. The only drawback is that they are very long (90 minutes) which I don't always have time for. He does always incorporate some abs, which is great."
969,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Thank you Philip,5,"After moving, starting a new job, and working way more hours than is sane, my practice had fallen by the wayside. With Philip's podcasts not only am I able to maintain a guided Baptiste practice, but also benefit from his spiritual coaching and wonderful sense of humor. Philip's reminder to ""take this instance of this breath"" is an instant chill pill. Plus, with his constant reminder to maintain uddiyana bandha, my posture and core strength owe him a debt of gratitude. I can't wait to attend one of his classes in person, but until that time, I look forward to each new podcast. I feel better than I have in years. Thank you!"
970,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,The Best!,5,These classes were my introduction to Baptiste Power Yoga. I am hooked.
971,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,couldn't do without this!,5,"I love these classes! Philip is a fabulous teacher, so authentic and real. Even though I'm practicing on my own when I'm listening to these podcasts, I feel like I'm in the class with the group. This is the next best thing to being in a live class!"
972,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Wonderful!!!!,5,I recently downloaded your podcasts when I was going on vacation and was going to be away from the studio. I downloaded about twelve different teachers podcasts. Yours were the only ones that I didn't erase immediately. They are wonderful. You are very clear on your instructions and very funny and delightful. I just wanted to thank you for them.
973,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Fabulous class--please post more!,5,"I count on these classes, especially since there's no Baptiste-affiliated studio anywhere near where I live. Phillip is a great and warm teacher. Please post more podcasts soon!"
974,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Major endorphins,5,Thank you for posting your podcasts Philip! I did one of the power hour practice and it was INTENSE but I feel sooo good now!
975,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Philip-ize..Such a BLAST of fun and movement!,5,"If you are searching, as I did, to have to bring your yoga practice into your own home instead of a studio, stumble yourself onto your mat and loose yourself into laughter with Philip's leadership into your own flow. Its great to have these classes that are not just geared for beginners but are for those people who are continuing their practice! You still even get a sense of community if you miss having people around. Thank you! Don't leave your iPod community who can't thank you personally."
976,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Philip's asana and introspective approach resonates authentic and D E E P.,5,"It's important to resonate with any instructor. It inspires one to take another journey on your mat.
As an instructor living in Nicaragua, I utilize his podcasts to get my sweat on but more importantly taking my focus very deep. Philip's blend with his work in 'A Crash Course in Miracles' and yoga instruction is some of the very best I've experienced. He does a graceful, succinct job to 'yoke' the physical, mental, but even more importantly the true spiritual yoga practice. **Bravissimo(!) and many thanks for sharing the love."
977,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,YOGA MASTERS ONLY!!,1,"These classes are for yoga masters only. There is ZERO instruction. Philip basically calls out the names of postures and tells students occassionally to breathe in. He talks a lot about things I don't even understand and I've been practicing for over 10 years. Lots of spiritual stuff and then silly things like ""spread your toes"" and whatever. If you haven't practiced yoga for a long time with an in person teacher, and this type of yoga even better, these recordings are useless...."
978,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Great challenging advanced power yoga,5,"I have been practicing baptiste style power yoga for several years, and I love Philip's podcasts. He keeps a good pace and talks just enough...I have tried the other Baptiste power yoga podcasts and my issues with the others are the chatiness, sound quality and lack of cues. I think Philip gets all of these right....I would definitely say this is not for beginners. You need to know your poses to get the most out of these podcasts. My favorite is fast hour of power...great workout with a great flow of my favorite poses -- give it a try!"
979,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,great yoga classes,5,"These really are great. I've only done 2 so far, but they appear to all be audio taken from yoga classes directly. This is perfect for me, but if you're new to yoga, I'd suggest some video podcasts first - the poses aren't fully explained here. For those who know the poses, these are really good. Nuff said. Download, subscribe, rate."
980,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Wish there were more!,5,LOVE the hours of power. No nonsense. Perfection. Thank you! WIsh there were more. Pretty Please!
981,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,Perfect supplement to in-person class,5,I practice at Baptiste in Brookline and when I'm in town I go 5-6 times per week. This is the perfect way for me to continue my practice from outside Boston. You need to be familiar with yoga and perhaps even familiar with Baptiste to fully appreciate the class or you may find yourself a bit lost.
982,Yoga classes - Live Love Teach - Yoga Teacher Training School,This is how we do it.,5,Live Love Teach are some of the best yoga teachers around today if you are anywhere near one of their studios you have got to treat yourself to some wonderful yoga and a darn tootin good time. Mooooooo!
983,Hay House Live!¬Æ Podcast,Yes or no,3,Joe‚Äôs brilliant message was lost in the annoying and distracting rhetorical audience engagement phrases: ‚Äúyes or no?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you with me?‚Äù I want to listen to his amazingly life-changing thesis without the maddening you still with me? Yes or no?
984,Hay House Live!¬Æ Podcast,Great podcast for empowerment,5,I host the Transform your Mind with coach Myrna podcast with and every morning on my morning walk I listen to podcasts to keep my brain in a continuous learning mode. The speakers on the Hay House Live podcast really empower me.

Thank you for the encouragement, knowledge, and for taking the time to share what you‚Äôve learned and gone through with the world. You guys helped me in a dark and difficult time. You gave me hope and purpose. I feel like I know you guys and you‚Äôre my fiends üòÖ I absolutely love the podcast, the website, and all the books of yours that I‚Äôve bought so far!!

In any case. I highly recommend this podcast!!"
990,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Amazing!!,5,So here it is almost August 2019 and I have been AIP For over a year and just now found this! I started from the beginning- 2016 podcasts and I‚Äôm addicted! I‚Äôm binge listening üòú I feel like I‚Äôm way behind but I‚Äôm catching up quickly and I‚Äôm feeling so much better because of it! I was finally diagnosed Hashimoto‚Äôs after about 8 years of thinking I was going through menopause (until the main symptoms plus adrenal fatigue kicked in) I want to become an AIP certified health coach so I‚Äôll probably be listening to these episodes again and taking lots of notes! Angie and Mickey there are no words to say how thankful we are that you guys have been such pioneers in this area! Whenever I hear Angie start to cry I tear up with her LOL. Keep up the good work ladies and most of all keep putting these podcasts out! They are helping millions and millions of women find their health again and there‚Äôs no prices that you can put on that! Much love to you both! üíóüíóüíó
991,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thankful!,5,So thankful I found these ladies! To finally feel like you have found people that just ‚Äúget it‚Äù is the best feeling. It feels like they‚Äôre talking directly to me and this resonates so much with my own story and diagnosis. What a wealth of information! I am going to binge listen to the rest of the podcast this week! :)
992,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Great pointers on how to stay well on a budget!,5,"Mickey and Angie have an incredible amount of experience coaching Autoimmune Patients! I really appreciate this podcast as well as the ""SAD to AIP in SIX"" program to deliver daily coaching througha facebook group. They have a gentle approacha and emphasize how individual the path to wellness is. Such a lovely community. My sisters in AD! Love you two!"
993,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thank you,5,Thank you for this informative and relatable podcast. It good to hear that there are others out there and that there is a way to better health and wellness.
994,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,My AIP Heroes!!!,5,"Mickey and Angie are my AIP heroes! These ladies are in the forefront of the AIP movement and are helping people around the world get healthier with lifestyle and diet. I love how they focus on the practical aspects of how to do AIP in the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world, and while managing a chronic disease. Thank you both for being an inspiration and for teaching me much of what I know about AIP."
995,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thank you !,5,Thank you ladies for transferring all of that knowledge. I have being living under a rock!!! Did not know the impact a dietary change can make . Thanks for all you do! God bless you ‚ù§Ô∏è
996,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,So informative,4,"This is a great resource, particularly if you‚Äôre having symptoms for an undiagnosed illness. I love the honesty about their stories. My only issue is that some guests refer to autoimmune diseases in the past tense, as though the protocol has cured the disease. MS for example has no cure; one can only go into remission. It would be nice to hear guests be corrected on that misstatement. Otherwise, a very helpful podcast."
997,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,This podcasts helps me realize I'm not alone!,5,"I've had rheumatoid arthritis for about 15 years (I'm only 29) and was on numerous drugs for many years. By changing my food/lifestyle/stress, I've gotten off everything! This podcast has been such a blessing. I often feel very alone because nobody else close to me has an autoimmune disease and if they do, they aren't open to changing food, lifestyle, etc. Even though it's unfortunate other people are dealing with these issues, it's such a relief to know I'm not alone and that it's possible to feel good and even go into remission. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for having this podcast. Love you guys!"
998,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Great resource,5,I enjoy this podcast and their book.
999,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Amazing Podcast!,5,"This is an amazing pocast to listen to if you or a loved one have any autoimmune diseases. I've been listening for about a week now, and I am hooked. So informative and Mickey and Angie are a delight to listen too. Thank you ladies for the great work that your are doing and helping so many of us. Please keep your podcast going!!"
1000,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Insightful program,5,Each episode summary merely reads 'This post contains affiliate links. Click here to see what that means!'- it would be great if summaries for each episode were posted instead.
1001,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thank you!,5,"I just wanted to thank you ladies for this fantastic resource. I'm someone with a suspected autoimmune disease (still working on getting my diagnosis), and listening to the stories of other people in similar situations has been so immensely helpful. I've learned a ton from the podcast, and food stuff hasn't even been the majority of it‚ÄîI love hearing about navigating social situations, doctors, medications, insurance, etc. Dealing with health issues can be so isolating, and it's such a comfort to hear people who've been through something similar chatting away. Thanks for all your knowledge, grace, grit, wit, and compassion!"
1002,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,"Love it, Great Resource!",5,"This has been so helpful to me! I'm not even sure how I found it, but after listening to a few episodes I had to buy their book! They are personable, relatable, and most important, informative. I know all this information is out there to find, but they've done the leg work, gathered the pieces, done the research, and put it together for us in such a simple, understandable way. The podcast is enjoyable, and I always feel like I've learned something important after listening. They don't waste my time. The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast is a huge part of my road to recovery; I'm so grateful to have found it!!"
1003,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Well done,5,"Thoughtful, authentic, and authoritative. I'm inspired by these women and their dogged determination to arrive at health. I have already started recommending this podcast."

1008,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Informative and inspiring,5,"Thank you Mickey and Angie! This podcast, your blog, and books have been so helpful as I navigate 3 autoimmune diseases! I especially appreciate the openness you have shared about the mental health aspects of it as it‚Äôs often an untouched subject."
1009,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Love these two!,5,Helps me feel less alone in my disease!!
1010,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,So good!,5,I‚Äôm in the midst of my own health crisis and this is exactly the information that I needed to hear.

1011,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,I love this podcast,5,This podcast is an excellent companion to Micky and Angie‚Äôs book.

1013,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,So accessible and down to earth,5,I really enjoy this podcast. I appreciate how relatable and accessible the information is with an emphasis on inclusivity and transparency. Really awesome content and tone to each podcast!
1014,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Weekly Inspiration plus Invaluable Tips!,5,"I‚Äôve been following Mickey and Angie since my own AI health scare several years ago, and even now, as I‚Äôve healed and solved many of my own root causes, their podcast weekly inspires me with the incredible passion of real foodies in our community while offering innumerable tips on making an AIP lifestyle manageable, attainable, and even pleasurable! Each week I listen, I come away smiling at the creativity, ingenuity, and passion of our community. Angie and Mickey are both down-to-earth and exceedingly kind, yet they offer two varying perspectives on how to live AIP successfully - making it all the easier for a wide audience to relate. Their newest season (3) is wonderful! It is focused and deep in solving daily concerns for anyone on an AIP diet, tackling one of the biggest factors: budget. Give a listen. You‚Äôll be hooked!"
1015,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thanks for your great work.,5,You are making a difference in my life. Great information really helping me to figure out a way to cure my autoimmune disease. Well-thought-out lots of hard work. Love your book.
1016,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Thank you!,5,I‚Äôve been listening from the first season and really have enjoyed the podcast. There is something special about the time in my life (a new mom) and this season. I‚Äôve been so inspired and excited by this season because it‚Äôs making it easier for me to find ways to afford to have the highest quality most nutrient dense food possible. I recently found a local farm (after to listening to the podcast a few episodes ago) and am expecting my first order of meat to be delivered this Friday! I was shocked at the cost savings over grocery stores and the farmer is so helpful. Thank you for taking the time to get information like this out there!
1017,The Autoimmune Wellness Podcast,Wonderful,5,"I don‚Äôt know why I put off listening to y‚Äôall for so long, but at least now I have a back log of episodes to enjoy. Thank you for your willingness to continue to share your wisdom and experience, and for the wonderful way in which you‚Äôve put your podcast together.

LA is the podcast capital of the universe - probably half your members have their own podcasts already. This shouldn't be hard to fix. I know I'm missing out on great talks because listening to this literally gives me an earache. Fortunately I live in an area with lots of real meetings, but I can only imagine how frustrating this must be to my fellow sensitive-eared food addicts in more remote areas."
1028,Overeaters Anonymous Virtual Speakers Bureau,THANK YOU for this service!,5,"I appreciate the honesty, candor, and levity of the speakers highlighted here, the audio clarity of the podcast itself, and the consistency and regularity with which new episodes are posted and published. I also love that this is a weekly podcast, not monthly. (I'd love for this to be a daily post, but I'll be grateful for what is offered.) *smile* This is a wonderful act of service; one that allows me to hear the message of recovery on a daily basis.

Listening to these speakers and hearing their stories help me understand their struggles with food, and, in turn, help me face my own demons with food. I can only go to so many meetings a week. Hearing the speakers talk about their journeys is truly inspiring and I can see that there is a solution to my problem. Thanks to this group and the foresight to record and share their stories. I truly appreciate it."

I was not familiar with Mark Walsh until I heard your interview with him the other day, and was surprised and pleased to hear his connection with Paul Linden. I met Paul 12 or so years ago at a weekend workshop for male sexual abuse survivors where he was a facilitator. That weekend was one of the sparks that started me on a healing path that led me to changing careers from physics and medicine to working towards a masters in clinical mental health counseling. I made the choice to take that leap a year and a half ago when I realized how comfortable I had become in my body and decided to work towards an understanding how that had happened, and how I can help other people in their healing. Hearing Paul Linden mentioned in your podcast was a wonderful reminder and sign that I'm on my path. I'm working as an intern now at an outpatient treatment center, and as a volunteer group leader for male sexual abuse survivors. Thanks for putting your podcast and your self out there!"
1042,"The Trauma Therapist | Podcast with Guy Macpherson, PhD | Inspiring interviews with thought-leaders in the field of trauma.",Thank you!,5,"Guy, I appreciate this podcast so much! I got out of grad school a year ago. I am one of those young, new trauma clinicians you refer to often. I love working with trauma, but in my short time doing this work I learned we can not do it without support. Your podcast has helped guide me to information, knowledge and growth. At first I was feeling hopeless seeing supervisors burnt out, not consistent and not engaged. However, your podcast has revitalized my energy and restored my hope that there are great trauma clinicians out there and support along the way. It has given me confidence to advocate for my clients and myself. Please keep the part where you ask the guest ‚Äúwhat advice would you give to a new clinician‚Äù ( that part is awesome). Thank you!"

1085,Wise Traditions,Excellent!!,5,"This podcast has spoiled me... they make a great podcast seem effortless (which is Far from true!) I tried to listen to other health related podcasts where hosts speaking over each other, ramble, and provide seemingly random information bits amongst promoting their own products. Hilda and her group make an impact each time with clear and truthful information on a wide range of traditional wellness topics. Hilda is a great interviewer with a clear progression of in-depth coverage of the topic. Thank you WAPF, keep spreading truth!!!"

1088,Wise Traditions,"Irresponsible, conspiratorial, alarmist. No thanks.",1,"I've only listened to one episode ""Bucking the System"", but wow...that was enough. I strongly disagree with most of what was said. I found it to be conspiratorial and alarmist. There‚Äôs plenty of medical literature that refutes many of the claims. I recognize science is ever changing, and recommended dietary approaches continue to evolve. However one of the main reasons I disagree with this podcast episode is it‚Äôs anti-vaccine advocacy."

Julie‚Äôs voice was made for this medium... the words just melt right into my consciousness. I appreciate the content- from personal experiences, to meditation and relaxation exercises, to diet and health/ beauty. Her perspective on spirituality has really resonated with me and quite frankly given me more confidence to explore this aspect of my life. I hear a mature, self aware, confident woman when I listen to Julie‚Äôs podcast, and she‚Äôs refreshingly REAL (I appreciate the nuggets of sarcastic humor and wit!)."

1109,divine throughline,I came back when I was ready to hear..,5,"Beautiful SriMati,
I became an RRP fan over a year ago which is how I heard about you and Divine Throughline. I was so enthralled with Rich‚Äôs story (I am also a recovering alcoholic and aspiring to become a stronger athlete) and loved hearing his conversations which caused me to subscribe to your podcast instantly! However, after listening to a couple episodes, I decided that it wasn‚Äôt for me. I was only a few months into my sobriety and did not foresee the spiritual shift that was coming my way...(as say the steps :))
Since reaching my 6 month sobriety mark, I have started to feel different and more open and willing regarding the idea of a Higher Power of my understanding. I‚Äôve felt more drawn to the divine feminine and all the bright light that comes with that.
Two weeks ago I resubscribed to your podcast and I cannot get enough. I appreciate your candid and relaxed vibe (especially in comparison to Rich‚Äôs structure and format which, I also love) and I‚Äôm able to truly hear your words now!
I just started an episode that opens up with you playing music with your son(s) and it brought me to tears! I hadn‚Äôt heard you play together before and I was just so overwhelmed with the beauty of it. Your vocal harmonies were wonderful and I felt like you really opened up even more of your world to me. That is was prompted me to type out this review!
Thank you for the transparency, the truth and the guidance. I‚Äôm so glad I grew into appreciating what you share with the world.
Sending you love and blessings,
Susie from Montana"
1110,divine throughline,I Love Divine Throughline,5,"I arrived late to the DT party but I know my arrival was divinely timed. In need of some healing and validation I was led to this podcast via a Rich Roll on IG. Every episode I‚Äôve heard thus far has been chock full of wisdom and love. Sri Mati is so honest and real, she‚Äôs like a breath of fresh air that has come to clear the pollution out of the Earth‚Äôs energy field. The healing techniques alone make this podcast worth listening to, episodes 10 creating healthy boundaries & 26 Yoga Nidra are my favorites right now. Please continue to breathe your light into the world. Namaste..."
1111,divine throughline,The Greatest Podcast,5,"This podcast has added so much value to my life. I am grateful for SriMati's courage, dedication, and the effort she puts into creating this content. A truly fantastic podcast."
1112,divine throughline,Radiant?,1,"To get an amazing skin will cost you 350 dollars an hour. It‚Äôs shocking to listen to this promotion that is only available for elites.
Not an episode worth listening to."
1113,divine throughline,Community and guidance,5,"Julie/Srimati creates a beautiful space for community and guidance through thoughtful loving conversation, music, and meditation. üíõ‚ú®"
1114,divine throughline,Like the podcast but now unsubscribing,4,"Enjoyed the open, positive, feminine positions Julie takes. No one has to agree on everything but I kinda freaked out when I heard her being pro anti vaccines on the last episode Grow. Its sat with me so werid I'm unsubscribing. Otherwise I'd say she mostly very calming and brings equinimity to the table."
1115,divine throughline,Thank You,5,"A beautiful conversation. Thank you.
So much to learn."
1116,divine throughline,Thank you Julie!,5,I found your podcast so amazing and spiritual. I‚Äôve always felt or I was forced to feel like the crazy person and it‚Äôs nice to see that there is more people like me and that others are changing and being more receptive to different thinking.
1117,divine throughline,"Faith, love, and optimism",5,"There is so much more within me than I know. This is what I‚Äôve learned from Srimati. Her experience, creativity, and guidance are helping me understand how to unlock and better support myself on my journey to becoming what I‚Äôm meant to be. I don‚Äôt really know where I‚Äôm going, but Srimati‚Äôs brave and bold example makes me less afraid of the unknown. Thank you for your faith, your love, and your optimism. It is making such a difference in my life."

1124,Intelligent Medicine,Still The Best!,5,Dr. Hoffman brings on his considerable knowledge of an integrative approach to human health.
1125,Intelligent Medicine,Best of the health podcasts,5,I‚Äôve listened to this show daily for more than 15 years. Dr. Hoffman is a national treasure to all things natural health related. His expertise and integrity is unmatched.

I cannot emphasize enough how much he has helped me thru his program Health Talk with Dr Ronald Hoffman on the Radio and now Thank God thru The Intelligent Medicine Podcasts ! You are greatly appreciated Dr Hoffman!
Thank You.
Doctor Hoffman is"
1127,Intelligent Medicine,A balanced approach to health,5,"I have been listening to Dr Hoffman and Leyla for many years and will continue to listen for many more. I have submitted several questions that they have answered on air, one that was especially appreciated while considering a new medication for my husband. Thanks Dr Hoffman for your help and guidance, and for upholding our rights to supplement access."
1128,Intelligent Medicine,Great information,5,I am a practicing Physician Assistant in a Functional Medical Practice and through the years have picked up invaluable pearls from Dr. Hoffman‚Äôs podcast. I really respect the collaborative spirit in which he honors Leyla‚Äôs contributions as well
1129,Intelligent Medicine,best health podcast,5,dr hoffman is very enjoyable to listen to. he breaks it down and makes info easy to understand.
1130,Intelligent Medicine,Great information,5,Have been listening to Dr Hoffman for many years and highly value his podcasts very highly!
1131,Intelligent Medicine,Very Interesting and Helpful,5,Dr. Hoffman prompts you to think about things in a whole new way. Very cutting edge.
1132,Intelligent Medicine,Each podcast opens your mind,5,"Every pc I have listed to is exceptionally well done with thought provoking ideas and well educated guests.
The pc on MTHFR & dentistry are a few of my favorites:)"
1133,Intelligent Medicine,"My favorite podcast, hands down !",5,"Dr. Hoffman is an amazing physician who focuses on taking care of ourselves through proper nutrition and lifestyle. He gets to the root of the problem instead of putting a bandaid over it. I have been a long time listener to his radio show and now I never miss a podcast. He and his nutritionist Leyla have the best health information podcasts, hands down. I love this show."
1134,Intelligent Medicine,Informative and helpful,5,"I started listening to Dr Hoffman‚Äôs Intelligent Medicine podcasts of his Saturday show about a year ago. As a nutrition student with a master‚Äôs degree and pursuing a career in dietetics I really value this podcast. I love how he tackles and breakdown research articles so that everyone can understand. I also like how he goes against a lot of ‚ÄúTraditional medicine‚Äù and conventional nutrition recommendations. He has so much experience and knowledge and that comes through in all of his podcasts. This new podcast is great. I like that it is updated often and how episodes are dedicated to different topics. Q&A with Leyla is also great because I like to get an RDs perspective. Really great show, I look forward to listening while I clean, walk and cook. Keep it up =D"
1135,Intelligent Medicine,Great Information !!!,5,One of my favorite Doctors
1136,Intelligent Medicine,Great Nutritional Info by Dr Hoffman and Leyla,5,"One of the strong points about Dr Hoffman‚Äôs insight into nutrition is that he 'walks the talk.‚Äô He makes available on line what and why he personally takes certain supplements. Like myself, he is an older male, who tries to promote optimum health outcomes through regular exercise along with the addition of supplements to our good diet. Dr Hoffman often explains the mechanism of how or why such-and-such a supplement is beneficial for us, not just recommending it outright with a ‚Äôtake this‚Äô statement. I feel that he is a trained medical doctor who sincerely wants to promote positive health outcomes for his listeners and patients. His suggestions sound like his intent is to help people permanently ‚Äòmaintain‚Äô good health, rather than simply prescribing a ‚Äòpill‚Äô which may just mask symptoms, like many in the medical profession. He talks on a variety of health topics and may invite noted guest speakers, too. He and dietician Leyla regularly answer questions from listeners, so more, and often timely, health topics are introduced. We can gain more health knowledge through listening to these dialogues. Although I have never purchased items from his website, I believe that only top-quality items are sold there. If I lived in the New York City area and I had unexplained health problems, I would not hesitate to seek out treatment at his clinic."
1137,Intelligent Medicine,This should be required listening for all of us. Excellent health & nutrition advice,5,"Long time listener... Dr. Hoffman has such a balanced approach to health & nutrition, giving us the most sound info possible. I could go on and on about how great he is. Instead, just listen and learn! Leyla, his nutritionist, also offers excellent advice."
1138,Intelligent Medicine,great information,5,excited to be on the podcast tonight! Talking about vitamin k2 and bone health and heart health.
1139,Intelligent Medicine,Perfect for Staying Healthy,5,"You have to love a professional with amazingly valuable information that puts it out there for free. As always Dr. H, I appreciate your service!"
1140,Intelligent Medicine,Very Helpful,5,Dr Hoffman and Layla are well informed and can be very helpful to those that listen to the show
1141,Intelligent Medicine,Best Health Podcast!!!!,5,"I do a lot of podcast surfing and I always come back to Intelligent Medicine. This podcast, hosted by a doctor and a nutritionist, educates on a unique blend of alternative and conventional medical approaches. I call it unique because their only ""agenda"" is to educate their audience about preventative medicine as the best medicine. If things have gone past prevention, they have the experience and the education to offer sound advice. This advice might include seeing our doctor, suggesting supplements, recommending lifestyle changes, and/or offering the latest cutting edge techniques and approaches.
Dr. Hoffman keeps up with both the conventional and alternative medical research and shares it with the audience in a conversational, understandable, and enjoyable format (Leyla too! - the nutritionist).
I shop at their supplement store to help support their efforts. So very grateful for this podcast. I wouldn't miss an episode!"
1142,Intelligent Medicine,THANK YOU!,5,Awesome podcast with on fleek advice!

1146,Running On Om,Soul touching,5,"I love this podcast. Julia and her guests talk about deep issues and topics relevant to everyone. They encourage mindfulness, health, and growth. This podcast is inspirational and motivating. I am so glad to have stumbled across it. I know my life has been changed by the topics discussed."
1147,Running On Om,Honest & Inspiring Conversations,5,"I discovered this podcast after Molly Seidel placed second at the Olympic Marathon Trials and I saw she was recently featured on ROO. I gave her episode a listen and was immediately so inspired. I have listened to every episode in Chapter Two of ROO since then. This podcast has quickly become my go-to listen during my commute each day!
I am always so amazed how host Julia seems to bring out sincerity, honesty and vulnerability in each of her guests. Her questions/probes are always very genuine and spark great conversation. I think this podcast especially speaks to young women who are athletes or formerly competed at the collegiate level, but I would also highly recommend to anyone who loves the outdoors / being active.
If you are a first-time listener, I would highly recommend any of the Soul Sister Sessions episodes with Abbey Cooper or the episodes featuring Molly Seidel, Eliza Earle, or Clare Gallagher/Abby Levene. I found these episodes particularly inspiring, but every single episode is wonderful :)"
1148,Running On Om,Favorite pod!,5,I am nerd for this podcast. It always hits the spot.
1149,Running On Om,I really enjoy this podcast,5,"I found ROO because of Lauren Fleshman and immediately subscribed after their episode. I‚Äôve enjoyed each one since and even went back and listened to some older ones. I appreciate the thoughtful questions and discourse. There‚Äôs so much conflict in the world these days, I really value pockets where there is none."
1150,Running On Om,Love Running on Om!,5,"I love listening to every episode of running on Om! Julia asks such insightful questions, and digs deep into the minds and thoughts of her guests. I love that so many aspects of running are discussed, not just the physical parts. Her questions help me look inside my own mind to question my existing thoughts and ‚Äúwhys‚Äù as well. I look forward to new episodes every week and it‚Äôs always first on my podcast queue!"
1151,Running On Om,I look forward to every episode!,5,"Julia has a unique ability to ask not only the right questions but to listen and draw out thoughtful, insightful musings from her interviewees. I always walk away from the pod with a greater appreciation for where I am and with inspiration on where I want to go because of the stories I hear. Thanks for coming back to podcasting :)"
1152,Running On Om,My solo running partner,5,"ROO is the podcast I can bring along with me on easy runs, long runs, and even workouts! I love listening to the conversations that Julia brings to the pod and the amazing women whose stories are told. I‚Äôve probably alarmed more than a few people by laughing out loud to myself as I run past them, but the joy is so very real while listening! I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity to hear about different sports and outdoor activities that have made a positive impact on the lives of these women, as well as the hardships they have coped with in their sport and in their lives. I‚Äôve taken away so many new lessons, mantras, and ideas from ROO, and I am always excited to see a new episode appear in my feed! Thank you Julia and the whole team for creating this wonderful podcast!"
1153,Running On Om,Thank you!,5,"Julia is a very compassionate, aware and empathetic interviewer. Her intention behind interviewing is very easy to see manifested in the questions she creates. Thank you!"
1154,Running On Om,"Thank you, Julia!",5,"This podcast is wonderful -- longer review below.
I first met Julia while practicing yoga in Boston in 2017. In my eight years of practicing yoga, she‚Äôs been the most impactful teacher I‚Äôve had the pleasure of learning from. She pushes her students to challenge themselves physically but also to be compassionate with their bodies, and recognize when modifications or rest may be the best form of growth. She also incorporates readings, personal stories, mantras and other elements of spirituality that challenge her students to grow emotionally as well as physically. I no longer have the privilege of practicing yoga with Julia, but I am grateful for her podcast, for it has the same elements of spirituality and introspective growth she includes in her yoga practice. As a runner, I‚Äôm intimately familiar with many of the themes she explores ‚Äî from eating disorders to injury ‚Äî and I‚Äôm grateful for her skilled facilitation as she delves into these topics and more with women who have devoted their lives to endurance sports. I admire Julia, and encourage anyone with a love for movement and the great outdoors to listen to running on om."
1155,Running On Om,Inspirational and so fun!,5,"This is my favorite (new to me) podcast. I am a huge fan! They are real, raw & fun. The interviews are super inspirational. I tend to listen while running or doing lame chores like ironing or folding laundry-making the time fly by! I love Julia‚Äôs calm interview style too."
1156,Running On Om,Compassionate inspiration from heel to heart and head,5,"Julia‚Äôs podcast persona is so comforting and kind--yet she cultivates conversations that ignite real, intentional changes. Her insightful conversation with Lauren Fleshman about considered eating helped me take steps I've needed to take for years: wise, kind, real."
1157,Running On Om,Awesome! Would recommend,5,"I‚Äôm a new listener, found podcast through Molly Seidel‚Äôs social media. Such a good listen and unique group of topics. Keep up the great work!"
1158,Running On Om,Beautiful conversations!,5,I‚Äôm so happy Julia is back to continue these amazing conversations with women in the running community.
1159,Running On Om,Love this podcast!,5,"Literally the best podcast, I recommend it to all my friends!"
1160,Running On Om,LOVE,5,One of my FAVORITE podcasts! Listen listen listen!!
1161,Running On Om,Inspiring,5,I have become so inspired by these stories - realizing these athletes are just like every other human on earth not just the super hero's the media can sometimes make them out to be. The way Julia speaks with such wisdom and kindness is so unique and special to the podcast world. Love everything about it!
1162,Running On Om,Great podcast,5,Very interesting and inspirational to hear about these runners and their daily obstacles they overcome!
1163,Running On Om,Listen to ROO for calm & inspiration,5,"ROO is like my little friend in my pocket. I listen to these episodes on my runs, walks, and doing chores around the house to add light to those activities. These inspire me, amuse me, lift me up, and bring me calm and perspective on life. I was overjoyed when Julia resumes ROO after her hiatus and find joy in each episode."
1164,Running On Om,Talent Self-Awareness Personified,5,"Outstanding discussion with a talented athlete and highly self-aware person who clearly articulates the ups and downs of her progression through life. Molly‚Äôs straightforward style and willingness to share, in part for the benefit of listeners who may be having similar struggles, make this podcast highly valuable. Thanks to Julia for facilitating the discussion so well and giving Molly the freedom to follow her thoughts. Beautiful work. Thanks!"
1165,Running On Om,"Inspiring, honest conversations that stick with you",5,"The stories of the women Julia interviews are all unique and inspiring...and will stick with you. Julia does not shy away from asking tough questions, but you can feel the compassion in her voice, and she has such an incredible talent for making her guests feel comfortable diving deep in their responses. As you listen you will learn about amazing women, as well as leave learning something (or two!) about yourself."
1166,Running On Om,The best,5,"Julia is incredibly inspiring. Her guests are a true testament to surrounding yourself with people who are loving teachers and partners in health, well being, and being active. This podcast is like warm summer day. Her former series was a game changer and so is this 2nd act. Keep on Julia, we adore you and respect you."
1167,Running On Om,So much gratitude for Molly sharing her story!,5,"As someone who has shared a similar struggle with eating disorders and OCD but has since found and maintained a love of running and fueling my body to be a better runner and healthier/happier person, hearing her story resonated to my core. Getting to hear her story and perspective leading up to the trials (especially knowing how the trials turned out!) was just awesome and so inspirational! I‚Äôm currently dealing with an injury that‚Äôs taken me out of running for 6 months and it‚Äôs been a struggle - hearing other people who have been through it and come out of it even stronger means so much to me right now. Thanks for sharing and keeping on sendin‚Äô it!!!"
1168,Running On Om,Molly and KNEAD!,5,"Julia, my first experience with your pod was the Molly Seidel interview. You are such a wonderful interviewer, letting Molly explore her story by respecting the pauses, knowing when to very gently make only minor course corrections in the talk. I was fortunate enough to watch Molly‚Äôs inspiring silver in Atlanta and was blown away by her story and her insights, wise beyond her years. I‚Äôve subscribed and look forward to many more engaging guests and topics. Above all else, however, Molly made me a lifelong fan of both her and ROO when she called out KNEAD!!! This Li‚Äôl Rhody resident is equally obsessed, and Molly‚Äôs shout out is proof positive of her true genius! Nutrition be damned, gimme an old fashioned and get the hell outta my way ;)"
1169,Running On Om,Thank you!,5,I found this podcast just this weekend and then found the incredible interview with Molly Seidel. I can‚Äôt wait to listen to more! Thank you!
1170,Running On Om,great podcast,5,I had to listen to the interview with Molly Seidel after her making the US olympic marathon team. It‚Äôs great to hear someone‚Äôs candid journey and mindset with running. I especially like the focus on the joy of running and donuts!!
1171,Running On Om,Love!,5,"As a young female runner myself, these conversations are very relatable and have inspired a lot of personal reflection. I appreciate the balanced and empowering perspectives Julia shares through her podcast!"
1172,Running On Om,So relatable and refreshing!,5,I loved the podcast with Molly Seidel on mental health and professional running! It was so relatable and refreshing. I look forward to listening to more Running On Om during my long runs and I‚Äôll be cheering for Molly at the Olympic marathon trials in Atlanta before running my own race the day after. Full send Molly!
1173,Running On Om,Julia is a beautiful soul!,5,I am so so so so happy I discovered Running on Om. The conversations Julia has with all these unique individuals are always incredibly thought-provoking. Julia is so graceful in her questions and the conversations often seamlessly flow into those intimidating corners of the world that aren‚Äôt ventured to enough. I could not recommend this podcast more.
1174,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Best homesteading podcast out theee,5,"As a former city girl my whole life, I intentionally moved to a rural area as an adult for a more homesteading way of life for moral, health, and personal reasons. Melissa‚Äôs podcast has been the most important, informative, supportive podcast I have ever found to encourage me in this lifestyle! Just do yourself a favor and subscribe now!!"
1175,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Believer,5,"Melissa and Ann do a great job of making a case for being more intentional in how we live. We can create buffers (by growing food, i.e.) to lessen the impact of the next crisis. Maybe COVID will indeed be the ""nudge"" for us to live more prepared."
1176,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,An AWESOME Resource,5,"Melissa is so sweet, genuine and down to earth! She provides great resources for homesteading. She speaks from her heart and experience. For the negative people who don‚Äôt believe in God, this may not be your podcast and you don‚Äôt have to listen.

1179,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,"Great Concept, Poor Delivery",2,"The good: great info on gardening and homesteading!
The bad: I underestimated how Christian the podcast would be. I also feel like there is a touch of unnecessary fear mongering thrown in. The sound quality is really inconsistent."
1180,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Everything I was looking for and more,5,"I am so excited to have discovered your podcast. It encompasses everything I‚Äôm trying to do (growing our own food, cooking from scratch, making own materials, being resourceful and budget friendly) and more. I have learned so much after binging on past episodes and can‚Äôt wait to hear more!"
1181,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Almost a great podcast,2,"I think this podcast has some great and useful information. The host is a really great speaker. However, the sound quality of the audio can be extremely poor at times and I could DEFINITELY do without the bible readings."

My family and I live in rural Iowa, and have family focus on Jesus, health and doing things a more natural and old fashioned way and Melissa‚Äôs podcast episodes speak to all of those things! I love all of the tips and tricks I‚Äôve learned and now have both of her books on my Amazon Wishlist :) thank you, Melissa for sharing all of this wonderful information on homesteading and sticking to your roots :)"
1185,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Time to step up the sound quality,3,"For a podcast that‚Äôs been around for a while and has such great content, the sound quality is so bad! I don‚Äôt understand how it hasn‚Äôt been improved. I listen to dozens of podcasts and Melissa has the worst sound quality of them all. It‚Äôs so distracting and I would listen way more often if it was fixed."
1186,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Encouraging and resourceful,5,This podcast is so great!! Melissa is so encouraging and has an abundance of resources available to her listeners. I have learned so much from her and am challenged to keep growing in my own homesteading skills üíï

1189,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Safe canning,5,"Thank you for this episode! I have the same problem of how to bring up unsafe practices of me-Ma‚Äôs relish recipe. I think your approach will work for me. Really didn‚Äôt have any idea how to bring it up. Love the verse of the week.

I am just now leaving a review!) I love every episode. Even episodes I think I won‚Äôt be in to are so inspiring and informational. I love them all.

1199,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,"Good content, audio needs improvement",3,"The content of this podcast is great. Very helpful informative and educational. However the audio quality is so poor that often I cannot make it through the episodes. Please read up on tips to reduce the tinny-ness. It is negatively impacting your audience and is a barrier. Even without purchasing expensive equipment you should be able to produce better sounding audio by making a few changes. Unfortunately if I have other podcasts to listen to, I will, simply because the audio is so poor."
1200,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Obsessed,5,"I'm completely obsessed with your blog, videos, and podcast. Where have you been my whole life LOL? My sister lives in Amboy WA and I'm in Sandy OR. So hello somewhat neighbor. Thank you for all you do. Keep it up!!!!!"

1203,Pioneering Today with Melissa K. Norris,Amish and Mennonites,2,"I believe the title may have been secrets for plain living from the Amish and Mennonites, or something similar. I got to the podcast in a roundabout way, I was researching farmhouse paint colors.
I have to say that it is the only podcast of hers I have listened to, and I was disappointed, but I will try a few more before giving it up. The bubbliness is over the top.
Both the host and the guest speaker giggled so much that I think does the pioneering spirit a disservice.
Not everyone that would come to a self-reliance podcast is unfamiliar. Some of us come for new ideas and support, and we are not just peering in or looking to be amused by the surprise of of how plain and simple living is done."
1204,Dr. Lo Radio Show,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Dr. Noel, host of the Dr. Lo Radio Show podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"

1246,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,for all manner of savoring and SMARTS,5,"Finding WF&D and this podcast has meant a real freedom for me! Both have opened so many doors I did not know were even there!
I hit 40 and my struggles with digestive and skin issues blossomed from seemingly nowhere. Culminating into weight gain, mental and physical food struggles and a huge ugly self esteem crash.....I was lost and confused until you helped me connect the dots. After several years of the shame and blame game I found your book and began my healing journey, intuitively knowing it was the right road and inspired by your sweet voice that kept me trusting my body and reminding me to celebrate baby steps.
Your podcast continues to keep me focussed and on track with my health goals and habit changes so THANK YOU ALEX! Coming from a place of love and not restriction has been such a big breakthrough in my staying committed! The variety of guests and all encompassing approach to womens wellness is truly empowering on so many levels- I recommend you to everyone for everything... curiously insightful answers to questions you may not have thought to even ask.
I am so grateful for the permission to be kinder and listen more carefully to ME (cause She knows!). Even with all the ""information"" I had acquired I was never previously able to connect that my perspective shift was the missing link. Good things start from loving places! I will stay tuned for more insights, inspiration and fabulous guests!
Bravo for sharing your best so boldly and beautifully! And cheers to Her Rules Radio name change!

1247,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,Love Wonderful Wednesday's,5,"I so look forward to my Wednesday, to have Alex words of wisdom fill my soul. With 2016 coming to an end, and 2017 right in front of me, I have to say I feel some fear on what will happen with women since someone in office doesn't have much respect for females, and Alex you have helped me through so much of this, with you expressing your true feeling about so many different subjects. If it's about food and what it does within our bodies, and let me say hearing you say counting calories doesn't work just helps me reground myself to the truth, or relationships with people in our lives (working for us or not working with us), listening to so many amazing topics about our bodies, and I'm going with Christiane Northrup age doesn't matter that was a great interview, and love that it was near the end of 2016, lots to think about. You help so many of us. We as women must support each other and specially now, and my small local support group does that bcause of you, and your wonderful topics. So thank you for Wonderful Wednesdays.
Bring it 2017 Her Rules Radio ""matters""

1248,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,My Kind of Rules,5,"Love your podcast, Alex! Such a great find. Listening to your show is like eavesdropping on a real girlfriends' conversation. You rule!"
1249,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,A Friend to All Women,5,"I turned 40 this year and I am so happy to count Alex as a friend on this journey into the next decade of my life. She is kind, supportive, compassionate, and full of wisdom. She is the voice in my ear telling me how strong and courageous and intuitive I am. Alex embodies the notion that empowered women empower women and I am thankful for this and everything else she offers through her podcast. Do something good for yourself and take a listen!"
1250,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,Something for everyone,4,"I am a new listener to the show and I am really enjoying Alex's infectious positivity! You feel better after you listen to her shows. I don't always agree with everything she she says but that's ok (in fact I think she would be the type to want to chat about it and her your side, not to get you to agree but for a lovely conversation) because I don't think you have to agree with everything to learn. Anyone can take something from her talks and her diverse guests and learn or at the very least be intrigued to learn more. After each guest I find myself looking at heir websites and books to find out more information. While I am new, I plan to continue to listen and learn more about her teaching and myself.
Thanks
Lindsay Kovar"
1251,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,Alex is amazing! Listen to this podcast,5,"Alex bring energy, humor and great advice on her new podcast. I love listening to it as a woman with real life stuff."

1253,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,Do not miss this episode ladies,5,I was blown away by Alex's latest episode with Aviva Romm (#128 The Adrenal Thyroid Revolution). It was chocked full of informative guidance from both Aviva and Alex. They have good podcast chemistry and clearly speak the same language. As a woman who has Hashimotos (hypothyroidism) I learned so much. My body is an amazing place and everything ties to everything else. I wish we had more doctors like Aviva (and coaches like Alex) advocating for a healthy lifestyle.
1254,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,An essential,5,This podcast is essential. The diversity of information is wonderful. The delivery is outstanding. You'll learn and grow with each episode.

1256,Her Rules Radio |  Support and Inspiration to Help Women Live by Their Own Rules,Perfect timing,5,"I love when things come into my life at the perfect timing! Which is exactly what happened when I found Alex's podcast a couple years ago. At that time I had been trying to force myself to stay vegan and ignoring the negative responses from my body that I was experiencing. When I listened to the episode called ""how to not be vegan anymore"" it was just what I needed to change my mind and rethink my diet choices. Alex is the perfect person to get approvals from when you want to do something you're not ""supposed"" to do.
Thank you for all you do Alex!"

1279,Amy Myers MD,Dr. Meyers is a God Sent,5,"Thank you for giving us reason to keep fighting for our health. Giving so many answers to the issues that we need to know to heal, to grow, and be whole again."
1280,Amy Myers MD,Such great help!,5,I‚Äôm so happy I found Dr. Myers. I have been on my search for curing my gut issues/acne for over a year now and it all began from reading and listening to Dr. Myers. Thank you for opening my eyes to issues with my digestion. I realize now I have C√°ndida overgrowth. I tried to make an appointment with her clinic since I am in Houston but it was almost impossible. A year later BBC I found a dietician/nutritionist in Houston that is helping me. I really related to episode 32. Although I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with Hashimodos I did find relief by quitting gluten and dairy. But also I had the same symptoms where I had really bad fatigue and I think it was all caused by the permeability. I hope I can go deeper in my search and figure out all the details once I cure the overgrowth. But Im finally hopefuly I‚Äôm moving in the right direction by targeting C√°ndida. Thank you again!
1281,Amy Myers MD,Great info but...,3,I love the info that Dr. Amy has in here but I really dislike how she‚Äôll ask the interviewed guest their opinion and then tell them how she does it and why her way is better.. why do that? It‚Äôs the only thing that really bothers me about this podcast.
1282,Amy Myers MD,Great podcast!,5,Great information I have learned from these podcasts. She has a lot of knowledge. Great podcast!
1283,Amy Myers MD,Fantastic,5,"I listen to a lot of heath podcasts, particularly in the low carb arena, and finally Dr. Myers has podcasts for me in women's health that hasn't been covered elsewhere. Thank you, Dr. Myers!"
1284,Amy Myers MD,"Fringe Medicine, Mixed With Crazy",2,"Dr. Myers is a snake oil salesperson, who has created a vast internet presence whose only purpose is serving as a blatant sales tool for attracting business to her empire of dietary supplements, literature, and land-based medical care. The prices she charges are far in excess of the going rate for similar services elsewhere, and she frequently advertises that she can successfully treat complex medical conditions via Skype.
Her tone in these podcasts is upbeat because they are little more than advertisements for her business, yet her tone on her blog where she has to actually interface with readers who have questions, is overbearing and dictatorial. Over and over, alert readers have pointed out that many of her claims are not just false, but also dangerous advice for unknowing readers. Although her blog pretends to be a ""feel good"" community, she quickly silences all opposing voices. There is no 2-way communication allowed, beyond members of her cult being allowed to tell her how great she is. She rarely engages in robust discussion of the issues, and almost never answers questions asked of her beyond saying ""buy my products.""
As someone who has suffered for years from aspects of the same diseases she now treats, Dr. Meyers frequently allows her emotions to cloud her judgment as a healer, as she posts wildly irresponsible and over-generalized personal biases that disagree with accepted science, such as ""food can cure cancer"", and ""gluten is responsible for most cases of autoimmune disease."" She frequently displays paranoia publicly, such as when she proclaimed to the world in her blog that an article that she had previously posted *must have been* removed by the government who felt threatened by her approach to medicine. What sort of doctor breaks that line of professionalism, in a callous attempt to buddy up to readers desperately in need of medical advice?
The words I would use to describe her are controlling, biased, willingly blind, and emotionally and medically imbalanced. Take what you can away from her podcasts, but avoid personal contact with this doctor at all costs."
1285,Amy Myers MD,Thank you!,5,"So thankful I came across this podcast. The information Dr. Myer shares is priceless to our well being. If you have an autoimmune disease and want to feel better, listen to Dr. Myer."
1286,Amy Myers MD,Informational podcast,5,"I started listening to Amy Myers a few months ago. Her podcasts are easy to listen too and always provide me with wonderful information on physical, nutritional, mental and emotional health.
I am an avid fan of Balanced Bites also."
1287,Amy Myers MD,Everyone should be listening to this podcast.,5,I recently discovered Amy Myers and I'm hooked. She covers some very important health topics and I love her attitude and advice. She says it like it is. She walks the talk too. She doesn't ask you to do something she isn't willing to do herself. She sets a very high standard for the medical profession. I wish all doctors were as informed as she is. Thank you Dr. Myers.
1288,Amy Myers MD,Great podcast,4,"Very informative and helpful - nice to listen to if you're into alternative health. The audio could be better, listened to one on a road trip and had to turn the volume way up, the voice audio quality could improve but the content is great"
1289,Amy Myers MD,Listen for Your Health,5,"Dr Myers has an incredible personal story and a heartfelt passion to share with others. ""Functional medicine"" is new to me and Dr Myers explains it well. It is also particularly interesting to hear her message as she is an MD who practices in this field."
1290,Amy Myers MD,Unique perspective,5,"A really good podcast. Dr. Myers background is unique. Super informative! Try it, you'll like it."
1291,Amy Myers MD,Going the Extra Mile for Patient Education,5,"There is only so much you can cover in a Dr's appointment, and these podcasts provide a wealth of information on topics you learn about when working with a functional medicine Dr. It is inspiring to find a Dr who goes the extra mile to educate her patients, and reach out to others seeking information on how functional medicine approaches can help them to achieve their best possible state of health and wellness. These podcasts are entertaining and informative; great overview of information on some really complex topics."
1292,Amy Myers MD,Inspirational for your health,5,"I truly appreciate all the of knowledge that Dr. Amy Myers provides from her unique perspective about health and healing. She constantly inspires me as well as educates me about topics that are critical to folks who have health issues such as celiac, autoimmune diseases, thyroid issues, etc. I love sharing this information and this podcast with my fans and listen to it as each episode is released."
1293,Amy Myers MD,Great informative podcast!,5,Dr. Myers gives great detailed information that's easy to understand. She has great info that I can take to my local doctor. Looking forward to more episodes!
1294,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Something for everyone,5,"It‚Äôs not all fun and games. J offers a global perspective of everything yoga and the moving parts that surround the industry. His guests come from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, subject expertise, and fundamental philosophies that create an enjoyable experience and make me curious about learning and exploring deeper. I have learned of some incredible folks doing incredible things and read some of the best books of my life as a result of my listening to this podcast. I highly recommend if you hold yoga dear to your heart and soul."
1295,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Stop steamrolling,3,"Good topics and good guests but unfortunately as many men of his generation, he often steamrolls right over his female guests words. I‚Äôm sure he is a nice guy and his heart is in the right place but I hope he is willing to put some work into correcting this and give women a chance to speak for themselves. It makes it unlistenable for me."
1296,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Love this weekly listen,5,I‚Äôm a yoga teacher in Miami and I love to listen to this show. Makes me feel connected to the yoga community at large. J is honest and cool and it feels like listening to a friend. This is a contribution to my continuing yoga education. Namaste
1297,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Not Trustworthy,1,"Mr. Brown postures as a curious yoga teacher and practioner with passionate exuberance for the art, the magic, the discipline, the practice. He gets on themes and engages guests from all walks of yogic life to talk about these themes. One of his themes is abuse in the yoga world. He has had many conversations about abuse in the Ashtanga Community, abuse in the Iyengar Community, abuse within Bikram, Anusara - and in general regarding the patriarchal origins of most lineages. Except, and this is a big sad, pathetic except. Except the lineage he aligns most closely with. The Desikachar lineage has been conspicuously absent from Mr. Brown's portrayal of abuse within the Yoga Community. The Alliance is to blame. Yoga Works is to blame. Jonny Kest is to blame. Well, funny thing happened on my way to a quick listen last week. Mr. Brown is crying in his beer. He is so sorry. He is sobbing. He is emotional. He wanted to be a friend. He knew but he didn't know. Pathetic. One of his teachers, a teacher he admired, supported, and championed; a teacher within the Desikachar lineage was outed (finally, apparently everyone knew - not unlike the other predators in the other traditions) as a flagrant predator. Mr. Brown's twists and turns on this one is nothing short of offensive. One star. I will unsubscribe after this posts.
And to Mr. Brown. Imagine your beautiful daughters - enthusiastic, emotional, full of dreams, full of invincibility, full of ego even - young, immature, brash, excited, daring, exploring. Imagine this person used, abused, exploited, raped for another's pleasure. Vulnerability, arrogance, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, wearing provacative clothes, being silly, being drunk, having an error in judgement, not listening to your friend, not being careful - this is part of growing up, and none of it condones or excuses abuse, exploitation or rape."
1298,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Rich in wonderful information!,4,"Many of these talks are full of crazy rabbit hole information that yoga nerds eat up! The only thing that keeps me from listening more frequently is that there is also often quite a lot of chit chat that Inwould prefer to be edited out. Too much personal gabbing unrelated to the meat of the discussion. Otherwise, the talks are remarkably continuously relevant. Any yoga teacher who really wants to think about what they are teaching and believe in should listen."
1299,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Feeling Connected,5,"As a grassroots, small studio business owner J‚Äôs podcast has helped me tremendously. I am kept up to date on the important matters related to yoga as well as life in general.
This podcast reminds me that my voice, the voice that doesn‚Äôt necessarily follow convention and trendy yoga pants, is still valuable and valid. Thank you for that J.
I plan on joining the teachers class as soon as my schedule permits."
1300,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Thank you!,5,Thank you for your work. I listen often and learn lots.
1301,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Great podcast!,5,Thanks for all what you share and your unique way of doing it!
1302,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Where are your glasses?!! ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,"Love your podcast, J!"
1303,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Disappointed,1,These could be good interviews because he has some wonderful and knowledgeable guests but he constantly interrupts them and even puts words into their mouths. Many times they have to correct him with his ideas about what they are actually trying to say! It‚Äôs stressful to listen to! Also he seems to have a vendetta against Ashtanga. Super annoying.
1304,J. Brown Yoga Talks,He knows what he's talking about,5,"I've become a big J Brown fan and you can tell that his years of experience really help lend credibility to his podcast. I also like that although he is steeped in traditional yoga (including the older strands of Westernized yoga), he still seems open minded and open to conversation. That's really the best part. He's just as good a listener as he is a host."
1305,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Balanced discussion on yoga and a great introduction to the world of yoga,5,I love this podcast. I started at the beginning just a few months ago and I‚Äôm over halfway through 2016 archives. I‚Äôve loved every episode. I started watching when I started yoga teacher training and I think J has provided an unbiased view to so many different ‚Äúhot buttons‚Äù of yoga. He‚Äôs touched on so many topics that are of interest to those in the yoga community and I‚Äôve learned a ton so far. His speakers are so real and raw and I‚Äôve been very lucky to get their viewpoints and opinions on so many relevant issues.
1306,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Real Teacher speaking with Real Teachers (and others),5,"While I maybe bisaed, as a former studetn of J.'s, I really enjoy his podcasts. Listening to him online, makes me feel like I am in his class listening to him talking about what he knows and continues to explore and learn. His style on the podcast is relaxed, casual and organic. He is not Anderson Cooper on CNN. J. has many concerns about the world of Yoga in the age of millennials. J. speaks frankly about his own biases, and welcomes difficult conversations with people to help him, and us, learn more about tough questions in the Yoga world. Yes, he does interrupt guests, but he is the first to admit that he is still learning how to be.... a human being. I love his honesty and self-effacing manner. Rock on J!!!!"
1307,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Love this!,5,"I really look forward to listening to this podcast. I deeply enjoy the conversations J has with his guests and feel that my knowledge of yoga philosophy as well as what‚Äôs going on in the yoga world have grown significantly because of listening. Based on the guests, conversations, and recommendations heard on this podcast, I‚Äôve been introduced to a host of new teachers, authors, and views. I also appreciate J‚Äôs grassroots approach, as well as his openness and vulnerability. He‚Äôs willing to not only question yogic tradition, but also to question himself with an open mind. Thank you, J!"
1308,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Honest and real,5,J is honest and real. He‚Äôs not afraid to ask the tough questions or call people on their bs. I like how transparent he is with his own life and how he‚Äôs willing to dive deep with his guests. I have learned so much from listening to his podcast. Thanks a lot J - keep up the good work.
1309,J. Brown Yoga Talks,such thoughtful content!,5,"i love how real this podcast is, how many aspects of yoga it covers, and it offers a great backdrop for what the modern yoga community/industry has become and can become. SUPER interesting."
1310,J. Brown Yoga Talks,"Great ideas, too much interruptions",2,"I think this guy has great ideas for topics to talk about, but it feels very much ‚Äòmy way or the highway‚Äô. I was also surprised how much he interrupted his guest. It was kind of awkward to listen to. Hope his interview skills can improve!"
1311,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Daddy daughter dance,5,"J, I love your podcast. I am a late blooming yogi and I have learned so much from you. You and your guests bring so much to the yoga conversation.
Your outro from the Bernie Clark interview struck my heart. Always, always, always ask your daughter to dance even when she rolls her eyes at you. My dad and I weren‚Äôt ‚Äúclose‚Äù but some of my fondest memories are when my dad coaxed me out to the dance floor. Never to slow dance but to dad dance üòÇ. Thank you for bringing that memory to the surface.
Namaste
Lauri Inkrott"
1312,J. Brown Yoga Talks,"Treats Female Guests Very ""Differently"" Than Male Guest",1,"Agree very much with what other reviews say about this guy loving to hear himself talk- the show whould be called J.Brown Talks ABout J.Brown. But the biggest problem here is how he treats female guest much differently than male guests- especialy through the group of ashtanga interviews he does. He fawns over the men Gregor, Eric, Richard Freeman while he is combative, insulting and talks over Kino, Genny Willinson Priest and is down right RUDE to Annie Carpenter his whole oops did I act surprised that you‚Äôre so old schtick was/is grossly disrespectful. Overall impression MISOGYNISTIC, POOR LISTENER and we already have plenty of these types of blowhards"
1313,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Journey of learning,5,Thank you J for providing so much information and enlightenment. I am so grateful that I found this podcast on my journey of learning!
1314,J. Brown Yoga Talks,I LOVE IT,5,"I deeply appreciate J‚Äôs inquiry into the business dynamics of yoga, the absurdity of Yoga Alliance and his encouragement to consider contemplative practices and gentle movement on the path of yoga. Excellent dialogues, interesting guests, rock solid resource ! Thanks J. Brown!"
1315,J. Brown Yoga Talks,J has become like a dear friend and colleague though I've never met him in person,5,"I love YogaTalks!!! J, thank you for this wonderful work you put out into the world. I am better for listening to it--a more fulfilled teacher, practitioner and student, and a less alone-feeling parent!"
1316,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Mixed Bag,4,I love that these podcasts are 1-2 hours so they can really delve into the topics. Jay‚Äôs not afraid to ask hard questions and he doesn‚Äôt pander anyone. Offers a variety of yoga topics. Some shows are great but some are very difficult to make it through because he gets on a soapbox/high horse and constantly interrupts the guest. It‚Äôs definitely more conversations than interviews and that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs really rude to keep interrupting people.
1317,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Entertaining and wonderful a variety of guests.,5,J Brown‚Äôs podcast is one of my favorites. He has had some of the most interesting guests and engages in such meaningful conversations. He is completely authentic and I love the edginess to his dialogue. He is a true yogi and I hope to meet him in person someday! Thanks for such valuable teachings J Brown! You‚Äôre a very cool human
1318,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Greatly Enjoy J Browns Podcasts,5,Thank you for your service. I have so much gratitude to listen to your interviews and your focus on the history of yoga teachers in the West as well as interviewing those that have researched Yoga History on a scholarly level. Please try to get James Mallinson or Mark Singleton on your broadcast one day!
1319,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Good stuff!,4,"I appreciate your conversations. Great to hear these topics fleshed out a bit. After 20+ years in the American yoga scene on the west coast, it‚Äôs an important thing for me to hear differing perspectives from my community."
1320,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Not listening to him anymore!,1,"I started to listen to this podcast because of the guests I was very interested to listen to.
But it‚Äôs really hard to listen to them when they get constantly interrupted by the host, sometimes even yelled over them, like whatever he‚Äôs got to say is so much more important. He‚Äôs simply not even listening to them, but rather waiting for the moment where he can insert his remarks or whole stories.
But after Karen Rain interview (or rather the addendum) where he pathetically struggles to find excuses for himself, I completely lost all respect for him. Will never listen again"
1321,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Refreshingly Honest and Transparent,5,"I just found this podcast a month ago and I can't stop listening. It is just what I needed during this time of transition in my yoga journey. In January I left a liniage and felt so alone because I felt like I lost a sense of community. Now after listening to a couple of doezen interviews, I feel less alone because I'm finding there are some like minded yogis out there."
1322,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Vulgar Language,1,I‚Äôm not sure the F*uck word needs to be used in every other statement especially when talking about yoga. Love the guest though but definitely not the speaker. I hope he doesn‚Äôt talk like that sound his daughter!!!
1323,J. Brown Yoga Talks,Premium Subscription,5,"Hey Guys,
The decision was based on my experiences of listening to 80 hours of podcasts before going Premium. The benefit was and continues to be all about fascination, sensitization and PERSPECTIVE!
It truly is a gift that all immersed into the life of Yoga ought to give to themselves.
Breathe in cheers!"
1324,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Just what I need,5,"Your calming voice, your take on what your guests have to say, your ability to dive more deeply which helps me to do the same- it‚Äôs all so straight from, and to, the heart. Thanks for putting it all out there and bringing us all together. Love you."
1325,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Love the new intention,5,Looking forward to hearing more conversations about the creative process and internal. Thank you for being raw and frank and genuine.
1326,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,YAY!!!!,5,You have been missed!!!!
1327,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,You‚Äôre a goddess and..,5,"You‚Äôre a goddess and you‚Äôre bringing out the goddess in me and the goddess that I see in others ‚ù§Ô∏è I live in Perth Australia, where can I find your book?! I was going to get it on kindle but I think it‚Äôd be more esthetically pleasing to have the hard copy üôÉ thanks Lindsay!! Keep doing you girl!!!"
1328,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Great topics!,5,"I enjoy that this podcast interviews a fresh array of people - not the same roster of guests you see all the time. (My only comment, said w love!, is the host speaks sooooooo slowly...especially at intro...I have to skip over it or play at higher speed)"
1329,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Deep and thoughful dives into wellness topics,5,"This is my new favorite podcast; so thrilled to have discovered it! Lindsay's innate talent for interviewing nurtures such warm and easy conversations with her subjects that listening in feels like eavesdropping on two best friends intimately chatting at a coffee shop. And the topics discussed are relevant and timely for anyone developing their personal wellness path. I especially loved the interview with Ally Bogard on meditation for dispelling the myth that a meditation practice is always a linear path, and for the quote about how meditation connects us to ""the intelligent field of life showing us we're ready to see more of ourselves."" Bravo!"
1330,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,"Great show, bad sound balance",4,"I haven't listened to all the episodes, but the ones I've tried have had very interesting and thoughtful conversations and/or topics. I just wish the sound were better - often Lindsay (sp?) is hard to hear, although at least the guests come through clear! Hope the show continues."
1331,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,"made me think, deeply",5,"I loved listening today to two episodes. What Defines You is a big question. But, Lindsay gave us this huge topic to ponder in such a down to earth way. Maybe because she sounds and speaks in such a grounded way. Then Beit Simkins interview was powerful and deep. Thank you!"
1332,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Want to connect with yourself?!,5,"Then listen to Well/Aware. Lindsay's podcast is so incredibly approachable, relatable and really leads you to be actionable towards connecting to yourself and becoming aware of yourself and how you navigate in the world. She calls attention to different methods of learning about yourself, your soul and your passions. I absolutely encourage you to listen!"
1333,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Very inspirational,5,Love! So many ideas are flowing from listening to all of these inspirational ladies.
1334,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Grateful for this resource,5,New listener and already have learned so much on natural holistic living.

1335,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,review,4,"hi! really love the interviews, so great to hear from so many people I have been following for so long in the wellness world, love to hear their beginnings story and how they got to where they are doing what they are doing. Less interested in the most recent, short episode diary like entry. Doesn‚Äôt quite offer the multidimensional perspective the other episodes have. but maybe has a place on the blog through writing. Thanks for sharing such interesting people and stories!"
1336,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Wealth of Information,5,"This podcast has taught me so much about the wellness community in New York, and has introduced me to new brands/people/places/things that help shift my habits in a positive direction."
1337,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Amazing Inspiration,5,"I am a wellness junkie in NYC and I have discovered so many AMAZING things through this podcast.

Thanks for this podcast - makes my drives so much better üòä‚ú®
1340,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,"A younger, more modern Krista Tippett",5,"Thoughtful and inspiring, this is one of my favorite podcasts. Lindsay is real and struggling with/discovering many of the same things a lot of women in our generation who are on a path to being physically, mentally, and emotionally well and self-aware.

1344,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,My podcast spirit guide,5,"This podcast is one I come back to again and again. It makes me wish I had more time to listen to podcasts. The topics are so relevant to me and anyone looking to grow spiritually, mentally, emotionally or physically. The episode with the guest who started Women Against Negative Self-Talk especially stuck with me. I've listened to it twice and could easily listen another two times. The show helps inspire me to continue my journey of self improvement even when I'm at my lowest. Lindsey really seems to put her heart and soul into this, and it shows with every episode. I hope this show continues and opens doors for more amazing things to happen. I highly recommend this show to anyone with an interest in wellness or mindfulness."
1345,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Calming + thoughtful + informative,5,"I love the host‚Äôs calm, gentle vibe and the thoughtful range of content she provides.

In short, this podcast has led me to so many great things in life, giving me resources that help make my life more well and aware!"
1349,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Topics That Don't Disappoint,5,"As a fellow podcaster I love Lindsay's discussion topics. Her content is creative, inspirational and outside of the box. Keep up the great work!"

1351,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,Love it,5,Such a wonderful podcast. Great learning about different aspects of wellness and self care. Love listening to this on long commutes!
1352,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,A Ten Minute Intro?! Ugh!,2,"I wanted to like this podcast, but the droning on for ten minutes about WHAT she's going to talk about, rather than just getting into it, was too much. Her voice is right there with the ""Sleep With Me"" sleep-aid podcast. I was feeling sleepy before she even got to the interview."
1353,WELL / AWARE Show | Wellness| Minimalism | Fitness | Mindfulness | Meditation | Yoga,love this show!,5,"One of my favorite podcasts. Lindsay get's the best guests! Her interviews are interesting and she has a calming voice. As a creative, I particularly loved the Mociun episode, and as a natural beauty freak, my all time favorite was Jessa Blades! Keep up the great work. xo"
1354,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Bad podcaster,3,"Listened to the March 10,2010 episode on fructose and speaker yawned the whole team. Seriously? I never listened to a podcast where podcaster seemed so bored and uninterested. I wish Dr. Mercola was speaking instead."
1355,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,How could you criticize free,3,"I would suggest you listed Take Control of your Life with Dr. Mercola. Much better than having someone who does know basic medical terms as the host on this podcast.
Still found some of the podcast useful and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be reading all the information. Doubt I could do it any better. So thank you for the free information."
1356,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Good Info, Horrible Listening Experience",3,"The click-bait titles can be ignored, but the person reading these articles performs his job horrible. An elementary school child could do better. I tried to hang in there and listen, but gave up and deleted the show."
1357,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Love the topics, hard to listen to the reader",3,"I love your prolific site. Great info covering a broad area. I rarely have time to sit down and read your articles, so I download your podcasts. As a former stutter I tend to be aware of speech patterns more then most. I have a bad habit of picking up bad speech habits and re-lapsing with stuttering. When I first began listening to the Mercola Podcasts I thought maybe the reader was new or un-prepared to read the information. But, as many more podcasts were suffered through I find this isn't the case. The current reader makes your podcasts devoid of most of it's content due to my inability to concentrate because of stammering, pausing, mispronouncing words and a general lack of topic familiarity.
I love your topics but I'll listen to many other health related podcasts that allow me to use my time to gather information, without being so frustrated.
If the reader is changed or trained please advise me and I'll be back. I didn't want to be cruel and figured the reader is probably an un-paid position, but wanted you to know why your podcasts might not be as successful as they could be. J.D. Bell D.C."
1358,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,good show,4,good show
1359,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Disappointing,1,Please find another way to have Dr Mercola's articles & views shared with the public.
1360,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Great information, bad delivery",4,So sad that these are narrated rather than spoken by Dr Mercola. Dr.M is such a dynamic speaker with great passion and insights for the best health possible. I guess he just can't do everything.
1361,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Great information ... Poor delivery !!,2,This podcast is just a dude reading a book... Often he even bores himself and yawns frequently ... And stope for sips of coffee ... While reading in his monotone voice and making mistakes. But the information in good if you can hang in there with the reader
1362,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Good info... Horrible presentation,2,Mispronunciation of medical and nutritional words is very distracting. As well as the yawning and sniffling. One episode you could hear kids laughing and joking in the background. As if it were recorded in a college dorm.
1363,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Terrible host - can't read, boring intonation!",1,I usually enjoy what Dr. Mercola has to say. I am puzzled though that he would let himself be represented by a person that has a hard time reading and has no talent for hosting a podcast. The host puts me to sleep when listening. It would be great to have access to Dr. Mercola's wealth of information. But this is not it. I had hoped this Podcast would actually feature Dr. Mercola.
1364,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Good, but often inaccurate information",2,"Dr. Mercola certainly isn't a positive person. Everything is fear based and negative.
Some info is good, but most exaggerated stuff with ""The Sky is Falling"" mentality.
Not really scientific, pure speculation and hype."
1365,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Poor quality,1,"Poor quality podcast. Difficult to follow with pauses, incorrect pronunciation, and yawning. Outdated source material is quoted."
1366,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Won't play?,1,Will not play on iPhone 4
1367,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,"Slow, boring and not like Dr. Mercola's text articles",1,I can't believe the low quality of these podcasts. The speaking is slow and without much inflection. I recommend that you skip these and read Dr. Mercola's text articles instead.
1368,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,I love Dr. Mercola's work,4,"As a podcast host of my own alternative show, Gluck Radio, I can say that Dr. Mercola is on to something. Wildly diverse, replete with great guests.. he's good. Pick a topic, any topic, Dr. Mercola has something for it. After 35 years practicing hypnosis and life coaching, it takes a lot to interest me at this point, and this podcast is one of them. Kudos!"
1369,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Bad host,1,"I like the idea of being able to listen to health informational topics but I can't believe that the host kept yawning, sniffing ,pausing and constantly making mistakes during the podcast."
1370,Dr. Joseph Mercola's Natural Health Articles,Host needs help,1,"Dr Mercola,
Please get a new host; we want to hear your articles, but your reader is tortuous to listen to.
Un subscribing again
Sad in Florida"
1371,Liberated Body Podcast,Binge worthy,5,"Excellent excellent podcast for any bodyworker! Brooke does an amazing job of making every podcast ""people friendly"",understandable and asking the right questions. Driving in my car Ive literally listened to one show after the other. Well done!"
1372,Liberated Body Podcast,Can‚Äôt get enough,5,"The professionalism of this podcast is enhanced by its humor and humility. Brooke is a great curator of content, but she is an exceptional interviewer, which is uncommon (my main complaint with podcasts sharing content like this). She facilitates, keeps a focus, and asks direct questions, and then she steps back enough to let her guest share their knowledge and research. This podcast encourages the listener to question everything shx knows about the body, health, and movement. I now have an exciting reading list of books by experts showcased through these interviews. I‚Äôm always buzzing after I finish an episode and can‚Äôt wait to share what I‚Äôve learned with someone else. Whether you‚Äôre a body nerd, a fascia-nista, or you have power to impact the movement habits of others, you will find something that challenges your relationship with your body and its relationship with the world around us in this amazing resource."
1373,Liberated Body Podcast,Awesome Podcast,5,"Brooke, host of Liberated Body Podcast, highlights all aspects of health, fitness and nutrition in this can't miss podcast. Brooke and expert guests offer insighful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
1374,Liberated Body Podcast,Brooke Thomas is The Terry Gross of the Somatic Movement,5,"Thank you so much to Brooke for putting together this revolutionary podcast. As an Alexander Technique teacher and Modern dancer I have always played in in the realm of Body/Mind Integration, but this podcast has helped get me outside my bubble. Brooke has introduction me to a broad community of thinkers. I feel inspired by the range of opinions and practices many bolstered by solid scientific research. I also really appreciate the podcast show notes, that allow me to follow up on intriguing bits."
1375,Liberated Body Podcast,Come back?,5,I am a yoga therapist and doctoral student in occupational therapy. I was recently introduced to liberated body while working for a clinic in Seattle. There is so much good stuff in here -- it'll take me all year to get through it! Will there be another season? Hope so and THANK YOU!
1376,Liberated Body Podcast,Thank You Brooke!!,5,"I found Liberated Body through your other podcast with Vanessa, Bliss + Grit. You had mentioned Liberated Body a couple times on B+G and it took me a while to finally listen and that was only a few days ago and have been binge-listening ever since. I sincerely thank you for taking your time in getting all this information out to people. I am thinking about a career change into the 'bodywork world' and I couldn't have asked for a better way to get such great information on what could be a life changing experience for me and hopefully people I may help in the future. You are a fantastic energy and I have already recommended LB to so many family/friends. Can't wait to keep binging. Thank you Brooke!!!"
1377,Liberated Body Podcast,Used to be much better,3,Quality dropped when she started taking more time with each episode. The older podcasts are much more successful.
1378,Liberated Body Podcast,Yoga teacher,5,"Brooke does an amazing job with this podcast. It has fundamentally changed the way I teach and practice yoga: I can't think of any higher praise than that! Before listening, I was having many issues with injuries, following American exercise/yoga dogma. After listening and researching her suggestions, I now feel far more capable of practicing and offering yoga that truly benefits the body and mind. The podcast sessions interview great choices and go pretty deep. Thanks so much Brooke!"
1379,Liberated Body Podcast,An invaluable resource for bodyworkers,5,"Contained in these podcasts are conversations straight from the experts and those on the front-lines of body research. Whether you're a yoga practitioner, a massage therapist, or an athlete; if you are at all in the buiness of living an embodied lifestyle, then these podcasts will certainly help you to understand and appreciate the wondrous terrain of your living tissue more. Brooke is funny, humble, and insightful in her interviews with some of the leading figures in manual therapy, exercise, research and movement practices."
1380,Liberated Body Podcast,Great Job Brooke Thomas!,5,"I love this podcast. There‚Äôs so much more mystery to the body than the Mayo clinic, doctors say, my yoga teacher says, perfect dead lifting form says world of research based, performance outcome body awareness. Liberated Body explores this mystery with the most pioneering, the most interesting, the most soulful explorers in the game. Sublimely, we get to go along for the ride, and see how much more we really are."
1381,Liberated Body Podcast,Joyful and eye-opening,5,"Great stuff! Brooke has put a lot of thought and a lot of joy into these podcasts. I have learned a lot (and learned a lot about how much more is out there) and had my eyes opened to so much interesting body nerd knowledge. So glad to find such an interesting, fun and informative podcast."
1382,Liberated Body Podcast,my favorite podcast,5,"Thanks Brooke for getting this information out in such a friendly and accessible way! Your effort is greatly appreciated, and I share your podcast whenever I can. I‚Äôm a rolfer too, and find your podcasts inspiring. Thank you! And for those who are poking around iTunes, listen to just one of Brooke‚Äôs shows. I bet you‚Äôll be hooked!"
1383,Liberated Body Podcast,Cindi,5,"Liberated Body is an excellent podcast!! I listened to every episode. Sometimes I listen to certain episodes several times because of the rich and informative contents. Thank you for bringing us all these wonderful topics, Brooke!! I look forward to your future episodes."
1384,Liberated Body Podcast,Never ceases to amaze,5,"It never ceases to amaze me how this podcast continually encourages me to reinterpret the world inside and around me in new ways. Each episode, especially the more potent ones, provides me somewhat of a new lens through which to interpret my bodily experiences. I so appreciate Brooke‚Äôs style of interview - it makes this potentially confusing information very accessible. Thank you!"
1385,Liberated Body Podcast,Great!,5,"Honestly i dont listen to this podcast regularly but when i do, i really enjoy each episode. I have nerve pain and some other issues, this podcast has given me lots of ideas. Mary bond has been particularly helpful!"
1386,Liberated Body Podcast,Great content!,5,Thanks for the collaboration of some great minds.
1387,Liberated Body Podcast,Excellent show!,5,Recommend to all body nerds
1388,Liberated Body Podcast,I am ridiculously impressed with this podcast,5,"I listen to A LOT of podcasts - many of which I love. This is one of the best ones out there - on my ""always listen right away"" list (right up there with the Moth). I also think it is the best health podcasts out here - smart, balanced, forward-thinking, and not trying to sell anything or blinded by their own viewpoint. And the sound quality/editing is seemless, which is important."
1389,Liberated Body Podcast,Life Changing,5,"I have been listening to this podcast since episode 1 and I am not exaggerating when I say that it has changed my life. I have been a yoga teacher for seven years and have been contemplating becoming a physical therapist for just as many. Somewhere in the middle of season one I went back to school to start on the path of becoming a physical therapist. Each and every podcast is so well done, incredibly informative, and always fascinating. Although it sometimes takes more than one listen for me, the information is easy to digest. Even some of the more difficult concepts are always broken down and made easy to comprehend without watering down the material.
I have learned so much from this podcast. It has made me a better yoga teacher, a happier and healthier person, and hopefully, one day, a great physical therapist. Thank you, Brooke! I appreciate the work you do so very much!"
1390,Liberated Body Podcast,Most beneficial podcast for back pain!,5,Thank you for this amazing podcast! I'm a former yoga instructor who has found myself humbled and limited by chronic sciatica. I'm trying to heal myself though better movement patterns and physical education. I've found this podcast to be very educational and helpful in terms of learning so much about areas that I should be focused on and learning to be more aware of my movement patterns. Hearing the experiences of some of the speakers talk about how their work was born out of physical pain that they experienced has brought me a lot of hope and inspiration! Please have a podcast on sciatica!
1391,Liberated Body Podcast,Amazing and thoughtful,5,"I look forward to every podcast. Brooke really does her ""homework"" her interviews are so well organized. I can't stop thinking about the ""stuff"" of her podcasts for days. Just love it....."
1392,Liberated Body Podcast,I‚Äôm Hooked,5,I have been searching for a podcast like this. Brooke Thomas has a great collection of interviews and topics from my personal ‚Äúwish list‚Äù. Excellent and absorbing.
1393,Liberated Body Podcast,Hopping on the Train,5,"This podcast has totally changed my life. I‚Äôve felt there has been something missing in my decades of Physical Therapy and Yoga Therapy practices, and this is it. True holistic healing. The interplay of eastern and western mindsets, the realization of our bodies as buoyant springy structures, and the ultimate paradigm shift this podcast presents is necessary for Every BODY to hear. I‚Äôve been squatting, crawling, reworking my ‚Äúfurniture‚Äù, and delightfully playing with all of Brooke‚Äôs material. Thank you Brooke for dancing us all down the path to embodiment!"
1394,Liberated Body Podcast,Love Liberated Body,5,"I always look forward to a new season or podcast post from Liberated Body! It's a very polished and professionally organized podcast on which Brooke invites serious thought leaders from the movement world. Brooke asks them smart questions, often times making me smile because I‚Äôm holding my breath hoping she‚Äôll ask what I‚Äôm thinking - and she often does. The show notes and resources are extremely thorough too, which I also appreciate. By far one of my favorite podcasts out there."
1395,Liberated Body Podcast,Let's take a journey to the magical make-believe for body nerds,5,"If there were a Fred Rogers award for podcasts, the Liberated Body would be nominated because of Brooke Thomas. In The Liberated Body neighborhood, she talks with each and every guest with genuine positive regard and curiosity. You, the listener are part of the conversation. You'll find yourself drawn in by new ideas, interesting people, and maybe find yourself having a little more curiosity about living in your body."
1396,Liberated Body Podcast,Favorite Podcast for Body Nerds,5,"Brooke always interviews the most interesting and cutting-edge thought leaders in the field of somatics. I always appreciate her insights, thoughtful questioning and willingness to stretch our current paradigms when it comes to the bodies we live in. As a yoga teacher, this is one of my go-to podcasts."
1397,Liberated Body Podcast,Wonderful podcast,5,I wrote the Anatomy of Drumming and I'm really enjoying the research minded thought provoking interviews in this podcast!
1398,Liberated Body Podcast,Body nerding,5,"Brooke, thank you for bringing all this wonderful content to the public. I started listening a few months ago from episode 1 and I am always texting my body nerd friends that every episode is THE BEST episode. Keep rocking it. Balance in mind, body, spirit."
1399,Liberated Body Podcast,Life changing,5,"Deep, thoughtful and fascinating; thank you for this work!"
1400,Liberated Body Podcast,Love,5,"Brooke I love your calming tone, voice, and podcast style."
1401,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Thank you!,5,"So, I started listening to podcasts recently (I know, I know) and ran across this one a couple weeks ago. And now it‚Äôs ending?! I am beyond sad. This really had become my new favorite podcast. üòî Davida is a true light and I hope she continues to share her authenticity with the world in some format. I will be on the lookout for whatever she chooses to do next. Just wanted to say thank you to her and her team for producing such a smart, honest and thought-provoking podcast.

1404,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,educational and fun,5,"That's So Maven is one of my favorite podcasts to listen to! Davida is candid and genuine, and down-to-earth in a refreshing way! Cool mix of wellness, business, and life."
1405,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,So many amazing topics and discussions,5,"Davida has done an awesome job branching out into topics that may not be top-of-mind when one first thinks of the wellness space. I‚Äôve had quite a few big, life changing aha moments as a result of her podcast, starting the the imperfect produce episode which has totally changed the way I view food, our environment, and has impacted my habits each and every day. Amazing job to Davida for driving impactful conversations!"
1406,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,"Uplifting, knowledgeable, easy to follow!",5,"I love Davida is amazing! Thank you for bringing in so many amazing guests- I have definitely learned to engage in a healthier lifestyle thanks to your pod casts.

Davida brings in professionals from all walks of life and from every area relating to a whole and well life. Overall the podcast is a wealth of knowledge! I especially love the focus on women‚Äôs health the past month. It is information that is not talked about enough and just so essential for everyone to know. I am so grateful for the podcast and look forward to it every week! Thank you, Davida! üôèüèº"
1408,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Fave wellness podcast,5,"I‚Äôve listened to a lot of different wellness podcasts and this is the one I listen to consistently every week! I love that Davida brings on guests will all different kinds of perspectives and backgrounds. I especially like the environmental episodes, and am looking forward to the upcoming women‚Äôs health episodes!"
1409,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,The most wonderful,5,"Davida is a bright light. She holds space for her listeners to learn and grow. She‚Äôs one of those humans you follow & feel in your heart that you‚Äôre friends when she has no idea you exist haha. Seriously, this woman is incredible. Her podcast will only do you right. Promise you‚Äôll check it out!"
1410,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Go-to podcast!,5,This is one of the few podcasts I listen to regularly. Davida is a great host - I love her solo episodes and the the diverse guests she brings on. She makes health topics super approachable and understandable!
1411,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Must listen to!,5,I was unsure at first if I‚Äôd like this podcast but I‚Äôm now an avid listener! I struggle with food rules and obsessing about healthy eating and this podcast is truly part of my self care in hearing about others struggles and triumphs. Davida has such a genuine personality and it‚Äôs my new top food/wellness podcast.
1412,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Love the podcast.....,5,"Great podcast--great content. I would just say, pay attention to how often you say the word ""like""......it's a lot and I am only saying this to help you make the podcast even more amazing than it already is!"
1413,That's So Maven by The Healthy Maven,Totally hooked!,4,"I started out feeling a little lukewarm about this podcast, to be perfectly honest, but I have since listened to every single episode (ok, most of them, I think I skipped 1 or 2 that didn't hold my interest) and I have to say...I'm a complete convert.
I LOVE how dynamic and diverse this podcast is. Yes, there are some episodes that don't resonate with me, but that's cool because they might resonate with you...and then there are dozens and dozens of others that DO resonate with me. The podcast covers such a breadth of wellness and self care topics and perspectives that there really is something for everyone. I also found that even ones that didn't immediately capture my attention, because they were from a perspective I hadn't considered before or maybe even ones I actively disagreed with, wound up provoking tons of introspection and insight because they challenged my core thoughts.
Mostly, though, I found myself nodding ridiculously and emphatically to myself as I listened with ear buds in during my morning walk, feeling as though the podcast guest was talking directly to me about what I've been going through in my life lately. And talking non-stop to friends and family about what I listened to. I was talking to my one friend about one of the episodes I had just finished and he asked what podcast it was, and when I told him it was the same one I had been listening to (and talking to him about incessantly), he was surprised by how much variety the podcast had to it. Each episode is so unique!
This is a great podcast to turn to if you're looking for resources in the sphere of health and wellness -- I can't tell you how many companies, brands, and entrepreuneurs are now on my radar after hearing about them on this podcast.
Highly recommend!!"

1434,The Party in My Plants Podcast,My favorite podcast ever!,5,"Not only is Talia one of the BEST interviewers on the podcast circuit, she‚Äôs also one of the most likable, genuine, and down-to-earth content creators I follow. Full stop. Her passion for healthy living has produced practical tips that have made such an impact on my life. I use her advice DAILY to eat more plants, live confidently, and focus on my health and well being. I‚Äôve bought all her eBooks, preordered her upcoming book, binged watched all her YouTube vids and downloaded tons of episodes because the way she presents advice is non-judgy and makes me want to love myself.
The best episodes are Talia‚Äôs solo episodes, which helped me finally go vegetarian! But the guests she brings on are great too. Listening to Talia ask insightful, well-prepared questions makes any guest sound interesting.

1440,The Party in My Plants Podcast,A must for those thinking plant life is the life for them!,5,I had been thinking about transitioning to a meatless diet for a while when I came across Talia‚Äôs podcast.

1441,The Party in My Plants Podcast,Obnoxious,1,I wanted to like this because objectively I like the content and I should like this...BUT - the way she talks is so absolutely over the top obnoxious. I was annoyed by the time I hit the end of my street and by 5 minutes I opted to just go the rest of my commute in silence. I feel like she‚Äôs trying way too hard to sound cool and engaging and it it just sounds like a group of younger millennials caught in a tornado. No thanks.
1442,The Party in My Plants Podcast,"Inspiring, fun, fascinating podcast üòç",5,"I started listening to this podcast about 3 weeks ago and I cannot stop.

1473,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Hey there,1,The podcast that you put out about curvey yoga is just wrong. She said if you do yoga and still have anxiety then your doing yoga wrong. Well she is wrong because nothing cures anxiety but we can use tools. I think your podcast was to promote her business. Not happy.
1474,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",A Must-Hear for Anyone Who Wants an End to Crippling Anxiety,5,"I‚Äôll keep this review long but to the point: This podcast changed my life.
Even though I‚Äôd experienced anxiety and panic attacks long before I knew what they really were, it wasn‚Äôt until about two years ago that my anxiety started to really interfere with my daily life.
At that time, seemingly out of nowhere and without warning, I began to feel lightheaded every time I drove my car. And when I say ‚Äúlightheaded,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean a little dizzy or slightly woozy. I mean full-on, industrial-washing-machine levels of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one half-spin away from losing control of my Corolla and finding myself wedged inside the fender of an 18-wheeler.‚Äù
At first, I approached the problem calmly and rationally: Obviously, I must be diabetic.
How did I know? Well, every time I entered my car, my muscles tensed up. My breath got shallower and quicker. I felt trapped, suffocated, seconds away from fainting and living the rest of my days with the crushing weight of knowing that I embarrassed myself in public.
My symptoms couldn‚Äôt have been more clear: Advanced diabetes was the only explanation.
I won‚Äôt go into how I figured out I was actually experiencing panic attacks. (Spoiler alert: It turns out that diabetes isn‚Äôt made worse by traffic jams.) But I will say that even after I realized I was just experiencing anxiety, I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get myself out of it.
I started seeing a psychologist and made some progress in identifying a few problems with my thinking, but my anxiety wasn‚Äôt getting better. I was still feeling fear and panic whenever I got in the car and I felt hopeless.
That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon this podcast.
Maybe the first couple of episodes just caught me on a good day. Or maybe I was tired of banging my head against the same wall to no avail and needed a new approach.
Whatever the reason, hearing from people who knew first-hand what I was going through and who could talk about it in plain terms was exactly what I needed.
This podcast resonated with me from the beginning and completely changed the way I approached my anxiety.
My panic attacks didn‚Äôt disappear overnight, but little by little, Kelli and Erica got me to look at the way I was talking to myself, at the expectations I was placing on myself, at the way I was approaching my challenges, at the way I was approaching my failures. And slowly but surely, I saw a change in myself.
At the height of my anxiety, I never in a million years thought I would be able to get back on a highway without dying or breaking down. Today, I‚Äôm proud, astounded and relieved to say that I take I-95 to and from work every single day (in Miami, no less!) and my anxiety is under control.
Thank you both for making this podcast. I can‚Äôt tell you how much it‚Äôs helped."
1475,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Smellyelly,5,Hey I‚Äôm nervous to write this review because I haven‚Äôt made it through all the episodes and I feel I haven‚Äôt earned my place to write a review yet. But I wanted to share how this podcast has changed me so far. I began listening to this podcast over the summer and the first 10 episodes really helped me realize just how bad of anxiety I had. Listening to these two girls talk about their anxiety has helped me understand that my anxiety IS something that CAN be worked through... this concept has been transformative for me. Just knowing that people experience what I experience and what I‚Äôm going through isn‚Äôt WHO I am but a habit that I can learn to understand and ultimately break the habit of anxiety. They have some really cool scientific definitions and facts that helps a lot including guest speakers. However having Erica break that seriousness keeps the podcast light hearted and extremely informative. I wanted to say thanks to you two. I don‚Äôt know two at all but I feel like I know you. And I really feel my life is changing.

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I have FINALLY breathed a sigh of relief after listening to episodes where they describe the exact feelings/symptoms I have felt. This is what I need in my life and I can‚Äôt thank you both enough for using this platform to help people like me to manage the daily struggle with anxiety!"

1481,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Favorite anxiety podcast.,5,So relatable. So excited to have found this podcast and excited to keep listening.
1482,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Game Changer,5,I have never felt so understood or like someone finally gets it. This podcast is great eye opener. So practical and exactly what I needed. Helping me down my path to conquering my anxiety habits and being a better me. I could not recommend this podcast enough.

1484,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",No longer a lonely journey,5,"Last summer I experienced my first panic attack and now they have slowly become a part of my life- my dark passenger, if you will. 2 months ago I was at my worst with 24hr anxiety and hair triggered panic attacks. Every new symptom brought me in to my doctor. I needed an answer that wasn‚Äôt, ‚Äúyou just have anxiety‚Äù. But surprise, I just have anxiety (probably).
No one in my immediate circle can relate to this experience, which has made me feel pretty isolated and crazy.
During my stay at Rock Bottom, I was always tense and I truly felt like I was losing control.
But I came across this podcast while doing non-anxiety-inducing-cardio and my outlook completely changed.
While listening to the first episode, I felt my body finally exhale. I don‚Äôt even know what these ladies look like, but I finally feel like Im no longer alone in this. Being able to find humor in something that used to terrify me has been huge. Plus I learned about neuroplasticity which gave me all the hope.
I have a ways to go on this journey, but I can see the faintest light at the end of the tunnel now.
So, Kelli and Erica, if you read these lengthy reviews- THANK YOU."
1485,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Thank you,5,"I just started listening 2 weeks-ago. Listening to them talk about all the different aspects of anxiety, and having multiple opinions, really made me feel like I am not alone. I never realized that anxiety is on such a broad spectrum, and that things I do , and feel are directly related to my anxiety. I have already gotten several tips on how to deal with some of my symptoms in my everyday life. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone who feels like they are alone in what they are dealing with. Thank you so much for helping me see some things that I struggle to understand. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1486,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Par tuner not a good public speaker,1,"If you going to take on a partner they need to have some knowledge of public speaking
No ahh umm or but. The first two episodes were good, then downhill from there"
1487,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Life changing,5,I had a traumatic experience last Christmas and started having super intense and regular panic attacks(about 2x week) and when they first started happening I didn‚Äôt go to work or even leave the house for 2 weeks. I got caught up in the vicious anxiety and depression cycle and was desperate to find anything that would help. I came upon this podcast and it has absolutely changed my life. My anxiety journey has been a roller coaster the last few months but has been in general uphill trend and I can honestly say that this podcast has been an Integral part in my recovery and understanding of anxiety.
1488,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",So glad I found this.,5,"Honestly. I was just searching podcasts for anything with the word ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù in them and this one came up. Every episode I have listened to has been so easy to understand and relatable. It‚Äôs almost weird how they touch on specific situations or feelings that I have encountered...anything from traveling / flight anxiety (and how to try and deal with it and face it) to exploring the concept of self care and the different forms it might take. Kelli and Erica are easy to listen to and make the conversations feel personal and relevant. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre being ‚Äúcounseled‚Äù or told how to feel or not to feel. They just are smart women who have firsthand experience with anxiety and have a lot of knowledge and valuable things to say. One of my favorite things I‚Äôve heard them mention quite a bit is taking the time to understand how things truly make you feel..I could go on and on lol I have recommended this podcast to several friends!"
1489,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Relieving,5,"My constant worrying has morphed into anxiety and panic attacks in the last 6 months. Just hearing that I am not imagining things, I am not crazy, and that others have gone through and overcome anxiety has helped so much. The humor between Kelli and Erica make you feel like you are talking with old friends who just get how you are feeling. This podcast has kickstarted my journey to better mental health along with my doctor and seeing a therapist."
1490,"Not Another Anxiety Show  |  Learn About Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Stress, and Being Human",Good content. Audio needs improving,4,"I like the content of this podcast. It‚Äôs insightful and interesting. However, the audio is off. One host is loud and clear while the other sounds like she‚Äôs standing across the room trying to speak into the microphone. If this was fixed I would give it 5 stars. I just hate having I adjust the volume all the time based on who is speaking."

As a child who had sugary vitamins, I remember wanting more, yet knowing deep inside me, they shouldn't be so sweet. I thought of the very young, who wouldn't know better. Back then, I'm fairly certain there were no childproof caps. I wouldn't give a child a gummy vitamin, I'd find something natural that isn't too sweet, but tasty enough to get it down.
If I were in your area I might consider seeing you."

1524,Food As Medicine with Dr. Anh,Such a shame,2,"Wonderful information , sadly the sound quality is so poor that the interviews can barely be heard.

On a trip to China I made was frantically trying to get around the firewall to get to my normal videos and get some sleep! I gave my podcast app a shot and gave Sleep with ASMR Triggers a shot.

1568,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Helps me sleep,5,Really helps to get my mind off the stress of the day and relaxes me so I can sleep! Very well done and high quality asmr podcast!
1569,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",R0GMAN Is Thankful,5,"I was stuck in a endless insomniac mode of no sleep
This podcast relaxes me like no other
Now I sleep very soundly and wake up refreshed"
1570,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Amazing!,5,"Very calming, and triggers are super relaxing and meditative.. it's unbelievable! One of the best ASMRs I've listened to."
1571,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Repetitive and Generic,2,"I tried several episodes but couldn't make it through even one. Something about this is just off. Disappointing.
Their other podcast - Sleep With Silk Nature Sounds - is much better."
1572,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Professional quality,5,Surprising how well this works
1573,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",No.,1,"Tried listening to two different ones, and both were in no way relaxing."
1574,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Soothing,5,I love the last episode with the guy reading poems. So relaxing. He has such a quiet voice but you can still hear his voice. Wish there were more episodes with him.
1575,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Almost there,4,"I love the podcast but when they tap they do the same thing over and over again, just some constructive criticism"
1576,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",This is a huge nope.,1,"I was already fairly relaxed when I found this podcast. But listening to only two episodes reversed that feeling quickly. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I found the content to be unsettling and even at times scary. Not exactly how I want to fall asleep. It just wasn‚Äôt for me."
1577,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Decent,4,I love ASMR... but this is not really what I am into
1578,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",It‚Äôs just not bad!üôÉ,4,"This podcast is so relaxing, but the sounds, like in the wood, paper and matches, are repetitive and that can annoy me, but it‚Äôs not too bad! I listen to this every now and then, either when I‚Äôm a little stressed or can‚Äôt fall asleep too well. I listen to this podcast at nighttime, after a long, grueling day of work. I recommend this if you‚Äôre fine with hearing the same sounds over and over again. I also recommend skipping the introduction cuz it‚Äôs longgggggg! But this is still great and I enjoy hearing these sounds!"
1579,"Sleep with Silk: ASMR Triggers (to help insomnia, anxiety, stress, relax, focus, meditate, ASMR)",Eh...,2,"1 star isn‚Äôt fair but... this gets so repetitive in your episodes... I tried this out and since so many other people seem to like your podcast then I definitely don‚Äôt think you should stop... but i think so far that Bluemind ASMR has u beat for me... maybe if u do a variety of different tapping sounds, and also episodes then ill try this out again but for now this isn‚Äôt for me"
1580,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Love!!,5,This podcast has been hugely educational for me (an aspiring farm owner I‚Äôve day). Thank you!! Keep up the good work!
1581,Sustainable Dish Podcast,"I get it, everyone should eat meat",1,"Too biased for me. The interview with the UC Davis scientist was very interesting , but 4 episodes later the overall program seems like vegan bashing. Some of your material is very interesting, but it feels bogged down by bashing vegetarian diets."
1582,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Outstanding!,5,A refreshing perspective on nutrition and our current agricultural system. Great content!
1583,Sustainable Dish Podcast,"Contradictions, unsupported claims",1,"I have to admit that I‚Äôve only listened to one episode. Thought I would check it out. But the amount of contradictions, unsupported claims and deviation from established science left a sour taste in my mouth. I‚Äôll try to update this if I can stomach another episode in the near future, though that may be unlikely."
1584,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Volume,4,"I agree with the mic volume issues mentioned in another review. I have to keep my hand on the volume knob in my car to turn it down when Diana talks and up when it‚Äôs the guest‚Äôs turn. Otherwise, I love the content."
1585,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Needs to learn how to speak into microphone,3,"Great content, and Diana does a great service for the regenerative ag community, but she needs to stop yelling into the microphone and adjust her volume down. And keep her mouth the same distance from microphone. It‚Äôs so bad that it‚Äôs painful to listen to most times. She also needs to stop interrupting her expert guests with her own opinion that is not from her own expertise but from what she has gleaned from others. If she just corrected those things it would be one of the best podcasts out there."
1586,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Great content!,5,"Thank you Diana for providing such great podcasts and content! I love the guests you choose to be a part of Sustainable Dish, they are always so informative and interesting! Keep doing what you are doing!"
1587,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Fantastically intriguing,5,"Diana does a wonderful job bringing on guests who share their expertise in many areas of sustainability. She truly makes me consider the impact of my daily choices on my body, wallet, family, earth, community, and other human beings. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
1588,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Just... Wow!!,5,"How can one podcast cover so many topics, suggest such good links, be a pleasure to listen to and get me to buy the (so much more than a) cookbook after only 2 episodes? It's just THAT GOOD.
Listen, help yourself, help the world."
1589,Sustainable Dish Podcast,RachelJames13,5,"Love hearing from different people in the community, especially when I'm buying their products. Would love it if you added a science segment or maybe the occasional science/educational episode."
1590,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Funny and informative!,5,"I really enjoyed this first podcast. Before hearing it I had been worried that it would be quite similar to the balanced bites podcast (which I am getting tired of) but I was pleasantly surprised! I hope that you (Diana and liz) share interesting farm stories, useful tips for gardeners and pet owners, and don't over do the banter! Can't wait for the next one!"
1591,Sustainable Dish Podcast,This podcast is awesome!,5,"I already love hearing Liz's hilarious stories about her homestead on the Balanced Bites podcast, but they always leave me wanting more. I was thrilled to see that she and Diana had started a new podcast devoted exclusively to their respective homestead adventures. I can't wait for the next one and really hope that the frequency increases to one per week!"
1592,Sustainable Dish Podcast,"This podcast is ""egglicious"" which in case you don't know is GREAT!",5,"I am so excited to have a new podcast to listen to on a subject dear to me, from familiar people with trusted views and opinions. I love all ""stuff"" farm, garden, organic, natural, paleo (get the pattern?:)) and love to listen and learn. I also love funny banter, and smart women, you two have it all. I hope to listen to this podcast for as long as I have been listening to Balanced Bites. You will have such a great response you'll have to go to twice a month in no time ! :) Thanks for the hard work!"
1593,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Real Food Liz Expands!,5,I've been waiting for Liz Wolfe to expand upon her Paleo empire by sharing her homesteading lessons. Adding Diana Rodgers as her partner in farming hijinks gives a nice rounded approach to the different ways we can learn to farm. Absolutely worth a listen.
1594,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Like coming home!,5,"What a great podcast. I have a small homestead with 4 chickens and many raised beds so I can grow my most of my own veggies and herbs. I make all of my own food, own 3 fridges (full of fermented veggies and beverages), and still work full time away from the home. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming to do this all by myself but listening to Liz and Diana has motivated me and provided a new community of support. Thanks so much. I look forward to many future episodes!"
1595,Sustainable Dish Podcast,I love this podcast,5,I love listening to these girls and their stories so much! They are hilarious yet they have so much knowledge to share. I only wish they'd do a weekly podcast to hear more about how their homesteads/farms work or their latest crazy stories. I laugh out loud with each episode! Love it!
1596,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Transported to another world...,5,"I am not a homesteader and have no aspirations of ever becoming one. But, I love this podcast so far because it makes me think about situations that are the complete opposite of my life. Hearing about Liz' escapades on the farm, animal breeding drama, lost cow fliers, and ""holy cow we got a calf in the driveway"" stories are downright entertaining and wonderful. I think this podcast is as close to The Real World - Paleo edition as we have yet to see in the paleo-sphere. But seriously, love the information and the passion about knowing where our food comes from. Keep it up, maybe you'll convert me into a backyard chicken owner ;)."
1597,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Keep it going!,5,"I'm living vicariously through you both! ""Eat the Yolks"" confirmed my deep belief in a Paleolithic diet and Chris Kresser's, ""Your personal Paleo code"" laid out my plan. Please keep the podcast going! You both are funny, informative and you make my hour commute enjoyable."
1598,Sustainable Dish Podcast,5 Stars for Modern Farmgirl,5,"Can't thank you enough for creating such an awesome podcast (especially for those of us that tend to slip into Balanced Bites withdrawal when we have to wait the obligatory 7 days between each podcast). Your message is delivered in both a hilarious and down-to-earth manner, and it definitely leaves the world just a little bit brighter than before. Looking forward to many more episodes. Keep them coming!$"
1599,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Informative and entertaining,5,Love this podcast. So much so that this is the first review I've ever done. My only suggestion is work on equalizing the audio. One of you is really loud and one is really quiet.
1600,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Wish this...,5,... Was a daily show! Keep talking !!
1601,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Full of info for all farmers and so Fun!,5,I just moved to a place with a very little urban yard and so excited for the info for homesteaders on all levels. Fantastic real information and the stories keep me smiling!! Always love all the work from both of you!
1602,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Great work!,5,I‚Äôm loving this show! This is a field (no pun intended) that needs great female voices. I love the positivity and energy Diana and Liz put into this podcast. Keep up the good work!
1603,Sustainable Dish Podcast,No Farms No Farm Girls...,1,"""No farms no farm girls""...try...""less judgmental opinions more listeners."""
1604,Sustainable Dish Podcast,I‚Äôm not a farmer but I listen anyway.,5,"Diana and Liz always keep it interesting‚Äîinteresting enough for someone like me, who doesn‚Äôt own any animals other than a Pomeranian, to listen along with each new episode. Lots of fun chatter about farming and other interesting topics!"
1605,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Informative & Thorough,4,"Very informative podcast and the guests on current available podcasts, have been amazing. A great resource to introduce oneself to topics relating to sustainable agriculture, animal rearing, food politics, and other subjects relating to people's relationship with food and food systems.
A previous review spoke of the judgmental tone of the show; there are moments that can be considered off-putting, (I was taken aback with a couple comments), but par for the course when people are passionate about subjects they are knowledgeable about."
1606,Sustainable Dish Podcast,Love it!,5,"The knowledge that it dropped on this podcast is a breath of fresh air. Whether it's the environment, sustainable meat production, veganism or whatever...Diana communicates in a way that is simple and straightforward. Love it!"
1607,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,New to the podcast,5,Listened to my first episode. Very happy I did. Great to know there are people out there who can 100% relate. Also walked away with some great tools to manage my ability to get mundane tasks done and build self esteem while doing so.
1608,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Worth a listen,4,"First time listener, chose the episode about doing overwhelming and mind-numbing tasks. Came away with what I sense will be useful tools and a systematic way of approaching many things that will work organically with my brain, not against it. This approach is a little bit how I‚Äôve been doing things without realizing it , so I appreciate that validation, but takes it to another level and gets very concrete and specific about the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù Mind mapping, redoing the action list, sketch pad, horizontal line very helpful. The list-making in itself can really trip me up. Also the message about protein and cardio setting the day on a certain course. Quantifying how much protein and cardio are enough/necessary. Will listen again and check out the website."
1609,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Format could use work,3,"While I truly like the content, the intro could be fine tuned. There is about 5-10 minutes in the very beginning of episodes where you are given announcements or the like. I muscled my way through and then had my daughter listen. She also has ADD. She stated that if I hadn‚Äôt made her listen she would have turned it off after the first 5 minutes. Consider putting that information at the end of each episode. It‚Äôs extremely hard to get through that as a new listener and I bet you lose a lot of new subscribers because of it."
1610,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Huge!,5,"I‚Äôm just scratching the surface of this podcast but i started with the 5 mini-episodes that kind of break down the whole idea. It‚Äôs very easily digested. Highly recommend. Can‚Äôt wait to read the book.
Already this has opened me up to so many new ideas. Namely, looking at myself as capable and not broken. Huge."
1611,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,An exercise in frustration,1,It took 10 minutes for the shameless self promotion to end and for the episode to begin
1612,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Way too much advertisement in episodes,3,I‚Äôm at 8 minutes in an episode and the body of the episode is still nowhere to be found... Please consider new listeners each episode. You should only have one call to action in an episode period. maybe one in beginning and one in middle. Then get out of the way and start.
1613,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Fantastic Podcast,5,I love this podcast. Michael has been incredibly helpful in my journey. I highly recommend it to anyone
1614,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Glad I found it!!,5,Very informative and useful. You feel great knowing that you are understood and that there are solutions. The Author of who the book is based on is so good at keeping your attention. Glad I found this podcast
1615,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,I just Leveled Up,5,"I have diagnosed yet unmanaged adult ADD. My fianc√©, who is clueless on this topic bought me (and one for himself to learn about me) the book ‚ÄúThe Drummer and the Great Mountain.‚Äù My immediate response was, I don‚Äôt read books anymore, I listen to them. I love books, but realizing why I re-read the same page 3x without it ‚Äòsticking,‚Äô I now know it is a symptom of my ADD. So, the sweetheart that he is, my fianc√© sent me a link to this podcast. Now it‚Äôs been over three months since he has sent it to me. I just listened to 4 episodes in a row because the very first episode made me feel so understood. I listened to them on 2x playback-speed. This is the best way for my brain to maintain being stimulated by just listening. Please try this if you have this problem as well. It changed my life. Now I listen to most audio on 2x playback speed while writing in my journal or scrolling through pictures. My mind needs constant stimulation.
Thanks to this podcast, I am journaling and gaining clarity on my struggles. I feel like I just unlocked a new level of understanding. Thank you for sharing this awesome podcast with the world. I‚Äôm encouraged to start my own Podcast based on my progress in managing my ADD; it will most likely be called something like ‚ÄòLevel Up with Sasha.‚Äô So look for it on here in three months, or when I get around to it. Haha Keep me in your prayers! Best Wishes to all!
üôèüèº"
1616,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,This podcast has helped my whole life!,5,"I have learned so much and gotten so much support from this podcast. It‚Äôs so calming and helpful to listen to, and feels so good to know there are so many other adults who struggle with similar things and also think about these struggles with an understanding that these traits can also be a blessing! That has been huge for me. I listened to this podcast for about a year and then took one of Micheal‚Äôs online classes.. which helped me put things into action in positive ways in my life so much more!"
1617,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Pioneering material in Mental Health,5,"For you or friends or family with this neurological type, the tools and information provided shed great light on how to maintain balance and manage, reduce, and possibly eliminate symptoms. The tools are here. Success is likely if you apply yourself. Be well!"
1618,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Quantum Leap!!!,5,"I reframed my own ADHD from a ‚ÄúDisorder‚Äù to a ‚ÄúGift‚Äù in the late 90‚Äôs when I first read Thom Hartmann‚Äôs book ""ADD A Different Perception: The Hunter In A Farmer‚Äôs World Book.‚Äù That book and the Hunter/Farmer Theory rocked my world in a huge way. Now with Michael‚Äôs new book ""The Drummer and The Great Mountain"" and THIS AWESOME companion Podcast, he has taken a QUANTUM LEAP forward with support information and tools to help transform the ADHD Mind that builds on the foundation that Thom built AND takes it way further!!!
I can‚Äôt recommend this book and podcast enough to all the creative Hunters in this world! Without HUNTERS this world would be a BORING PLACE!!! (And without Farmers nothing would ever get done lol) CELEBRATE the HUNTER/FARMER DIVERSITY!"
1619,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,The Change The World Needs To See!,5,"This podcast is a brilliant partner to the book! The information is helpful, the energy is positive and Michael gives concrete solutions to dealing with the characteristics of ADHD. I am always learning something new from Michael's podcasts. So grateful for this gift that Michael is sharing with the world."
1620,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,So Helpful,5,"I can't even begin to tell you how helpful this podcast has been. In a moment of desperation I searched the iTunes Store for ""ADD podcast""‚ÄìI'm so glad I stumbled upon The Drummer and the Great Mountain. As someone who was just diagnosed ADD at age 30, I wanted to learn as much as I could. I immediately got on medication after learning my ADD diagnosis, and it helped some. My first thought was ""how different childhood would been if I had medicine throughout school."" But after listening to this podcast, I now think ""how much better childhood would've been if I had these strategies to use in school."" Seeing ADD not as a disorder but rather a personality type, just how my brain wired has been life-changing. The recent episode on laziness and lack of motivation actually made me emotional. It was so comforting to know that there are there people out there who have felt such shame about wanting to do the work but not being able to get started. Overcoming shame has been a huge part of this season of my life. I think us Hunter types it was a lot of shame‚Ä¶ I should have this done by now, it shouldn't be this hard to get this done, I shouldn't be having trouble with this, etc. Knowing yourself, your personality type and how you work really helps to combat shame. Thanks guys for the hard work on this podcast. You really are changing lives.
I hope this all makes sense, I'm writing this on my phone using talk to text. :-)

1621,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Not alone!,5,"What a breath of fresh air! This blog is encouraging and practical, taking on issue that really hit home. Today I am thankful for the encouragement to keep trying. To get up and get going back on the road to full health in order to fully live again, thank you."
1622,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Wonderful holistic uplifting!,5,"I am a PMHNP (Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner) student (I graduate in a few months!). I have ADHD myself. I have listened to and read countless hours of ADHD podcasts, read a lot of medical literature as well as general audience ADHD books (actually I listen to them on audio books because reading is challenging for me).
I enjoy this podcast immensely. The podcasts‚Äô hosts positive tone on the ""disorder"" is so refreshing. The hosts are refreshingly honesty and have a pleasant report. I appreciate the non-medical tone as well. While none of the information and suggestions they provide is new to me, I appreciate how they synthesize it all into an easily digestible podcast. I suggest beginning with the first (oldest) podcast and listening from oldest to newest.
The hosts suggestions on diet, exercise, habits, lifestyle are excellent and mostly evidenced based. However, I do not appreciate how they emphasize ‚Äúworking with ADHD‚Ä¶ without the use of medications‚Äù. Of course, everyone wants to stop taking meds, I feel their comments on meds place guilt on us ‚Äúhunter types‚Äù who still take medications. As PMHNP and ADHD ‚Äúpatient‚Äù I completely agree that diet, exercise, holistic, vitamins, and lifestyle are essential to healthy and fulfilling life with ADHD. HOWEVER, until you are dialed in with holistic ADHD lifestyle (and during times of stress when you may slack on your holistic lifestyle), you may benefit from medications. There is already so much shame and guilt about taking a pharmaceutical medication, I wish they would leave medications out of their discussion.
When I prescribe meds, I prescribe and emphasize diet changes, exercise, supplements, etc. I believe these are equally if not more effective than medications. If your prescriber does not discuss this with you at each visit and provide resources, I encourage you to find a more holistic prescriber. I suggest asking your provider to check labs for MTHFR genotype mutations and labs for nutritional needs BEFORE beginning medications.
Besides this these guys are wonderful. Thank you so much for the wonderful podcast and inspiration."
1623,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,inspired,5,"39 and recently diagnosed adhd, not interested in taking medications, was inspired to find this podcast and book to help me reinvent my life, keep up great work guys!"
1624,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,EXCELLENT deserves 10 Stars!!!,5,"I came across your podcast while listening to motivational podcast for neurotypicals ""normal"" I have been diagnosed about 6 years ago. Since then I have figured that if i keep looking I can find a way to make it go away if I try hard enough. I stop listening to anything ADD or ADHD because its most about the ""struggle"" the ""struggle"" the ""defficiency"" and the ""despair"" that we ""Hunter-types"" are doomed to until I found your podcast which has been a revelation befor the diagnosis and now you podcast and book who I couldn't help to go and buy which haven't put down since about a week ago. So helpful and so grateful!!! Thank you for helping me make out of sense to all of this and to make me want to try to embrace and use it rather than ""sweep it un the bed"" and make it go away.. :)"
1625,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,COMFORTING,5,I breathed a sigh of relief upon listening to just the first episode. I finally realized that there is nothing WRONG with me. On another note: PLEASE PLEASE tell me there will be an audio version to the book. I feel it would accompany the print version very well.
1626,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Grateful for this information,5,"I must admit this podcast can be overwhelming at first if you really try to apply the topics to your personal life. However, as you move forward to acceptance of being a ‚Äúhunter type‚Äù or having a close relative that is a hunter you begin to stop the negative self-talk and move one step towards making a difference in your own world. After listening for a year, recently buying two copies of the book and taking a few coaching sessions I highly recommend this podcast! I challenge you to continue the conversation with a friend and try to dig deeper into each episode through dialogue. Looking forward to next episodeüòä"
1627,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,make it livlier,3,"It has a lot of good information, but it is so boring to listen to..."
1628,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,A Godsend,5,"I'm so grateful to have found this podcast and the accompanying book, the Drummer and the Great Mountain. I have felt a lot of secrecy and shame about having ADD (diagnosed as a 40+ year old). Not only is this helping me reframe how I view and talk (or don't talk) about it, it's giving me such useful and practical advice and direction. THANK YOU!"
1629,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Pretty good advice but....,3,"These guys are on a good track but they say things that are not true here and there. Ie quinoa being a grain- it‚Äôs not a grain, it‚Äôs a seed. Also, there is no study that proves sugar is an addictive! This myth is partly responsible for overeating due to restrictive and guilt mindsets. The study they site is a very poorly executed one. Check out Marci Evans RD about the science on food addiction.
I have found myself saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not based on science or facts‚Äù several times.
Needless to say the advice for eating as simple (avoiding processed, sugary stuff as much as possible, getting adequate protein and other tips are, in my experience helpful for dealing with adhd.
Eating regularly is really important. I ate on the fly, grabbing whatever and used caffeine all day before, it ruined me.
I love how they frame adhd as being a hunter type and that hunter types need to care for themselves in ways others may not need to. Anyone with eating disorder issues be careful. They mention weight loss and the diet advice can be skewed in for an anorexic or diet mentality survivor.
If you ascribe to HAES, disregard the weight loss talk!"
1630,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Helpful,5,Very helpful for motivating me to do the things I know I should be doing. Info that I have read over the years in one podcast.
1631,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,So relieved I‚Äôm not the only one. Thank you.,5,"I‚Äôve just started learning that I likely have ADHD within the past year. The more that I educate myself on it, the more it amazes me that I‚Äôm not the only one going through so many things that I struggle with. Education from these podcasts have been so helpful to me already. A couple of these podcasts made me cry just because I felt so relieved knowing I wasn‚Äôt the only one feeling certain ways sometimes. Thank you for this so much!"
1632,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,AMAZING! THIS IS EVERYTHING!,5,"This completely sums up EVERYTHING I have been going through my entire life but could never express, and I felt like no one ever understood me until now! He totally nailed EVERYTHING!"
1633,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,"Wow, I cannot emphasize how understood I feel!",5,"I absolutely love this podcast and am so grateful to have found it. It feels so good to feel understood. I ebb and flow through struggles with ADHD I was a chemical engineer, but quit my job to become a health coach full time after health transformation using a paleo diet. I love coaching, but now working as an entrepreneur my challenges have become magnified. Issues with organization, impulsivity, mundane tasks, accounting, followups, etc. I used to take stimulant medications for 5 years was definitely abusing them, i have very addictive personality, but I have been off for 2 years, but the challenges some days can be overwhelming, The practical tools are incredible and I love the Hunter perspective. Not looking at it as a disorder, but as a type and I love how this podcast gives practical tools to maximize the positives of being a hunter type and how to live effectively in a farmer world."
1634,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Better than a Self-help book,5,"This podcast is indispensable for creative adults who are fed up with all of the procedural, how-to, scientific, and ‚Äúcure all‚Äù self-help books. In themselves, such resources are not inferior or incomplete ‚Äîpersonally I have several great titles‚Äî but the neurological-type misnamed as ADHD demands a fresher perspective. Michael‚Äôs book & especially this accompanying podcast put forth a model which invites a new perspective. Yes, ‚Äúhunter-type‚Äù is an unusual identifying term, but at least it makes sense. The condition known as ADHD used to be called (in the U.S) ‚Äúminimal brain dysfunction‚Äù so anything is an improvement, one must agree.
Beyond the concept, the podcast hosts target very specific topics I need to hear & get value from. I found the podcast, then bought the eBook, but gladly wound up purchasing the softcover book. (incl the revision of time mgt). The personal stories & experience shared on the podcast clearly generate from two humble gentlemen whose motivation is to share wisdom learned only the hard way. Is that not what a reader or listener seeks after all? I think so. I‚Äôve not engaged all of the materials yet, but they have convinced me the hunter/farmer hypothesis is worth looking into.
Note: cognitive realities such as what is described as ADHD sometimes do require medication as part of a therapy program. I am glad that pharmacology is not dismissed however. This author knows his stuff."
1635,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Great podcast,4,"I listen to this podcast in my car, and it's been so helpful to me with my ADHD. Michael‚Äôs ability to provide simple yet effective strategies has helped me to balance work, home, and friends and decreased my anxiety of not getting things completed. Highly recommend!"
1636,Adult ADHD ADD Tips and Support,Life changing,5,"I knew in elementary school I was ADHD. Mom never let me use it as an excuse but medication to help with Ritalin. Now 33yrs, I still don‚Äôt have the grasp I need. My fianc√© is listening to this too, for us to hit our life goals. He is understanding how my brain works and he has helped with routine.

The one on lasers in particular was revelatory! If I had known before what he had laid out in his podcast, it would have saved me thousands of dollars. Every single clinic, doctor, medspa, and surgeon that I have visited is always trying to upsell me on their lasers. I might go in for botox or IPL and they tell me that I need lasers, peels, microneedling, these expensive products. Ugh!

I listened to a couple episodes and wasn‚Äôt impressed with the giggles about nothing, what‚Äôs going on in their personal lives, generic self help also available around every corner, and very vague info about hormones. I was looking for more science information/explanations. I found it more about self promotion of their brand/product(s)/book and less about helping women understand hormones. Hopefully this podcast has helped others on their journey but it isn‚Äôt for me."

Love it, love it, love it X)"
1718,Better Everyday with Sarah and Dr. Brooke,The first year is the best,3,"I have followed Sarah for several years now. She is the first ‚ÄúPaleo‚Äù author that made figuring out how to take on a real food lifestyle and care for my health seem possible.
Her real life experience of putting it all into practice is so helpful. Now, I just wish I could see Dr. Brooke! The knowledge she has of what is going on in our bodies is amazing. As a listener with multiple autoimmune diseases she makes it all so understandable. Every podcast I listen to makes me think, ‚ÄúWow! That makes so much sense.‚Äù I have had to have a good understanding of what is happening in my body. But Dr. Brooke's information is bringing it to a new level.
Edited May 2018:
I still definitely agree with what I wrote above for about the first year of the podcast. After that I think the helpfulness drops off. Lots of information you‚Äôve already learned is delivered, but I largely found it less helpful because I started to feel like I was being ‚Äúsold‚Äù to much more. I understand that to promote and sell their book/services is probably largely the point of the podcast. But it‚Äôs just not speaking to where I am anymore."

I believed they would do an outstanding job of this, and they have exceeded my every expectation. They vary the subject matter, sometimes answering listeners' questions, sometimes bringing on guest experts, and sometimes sharing their own very personal struggles. They are such a great exemplar of the program they have developed. Their book, ""Hangry"" will be out at the end of June, and it will tie in beautifully with the podcast! The cool thing is that all the episodes of this podcast are still relevant and worth listening to! There is something for every woman in these offerings. Please listen, and buy the book. You will be glad you did."

1730,Holistic Survival Show,Funny!,3,"Some of the ridiculous characters he has on the show like Aaron Clarey, remind me of my non-ironic myopic grand father. Fun to listen to, but so dated in his opinion and unreasonable in outlook it‚Äôs really entertaining! It just makes me laugh."
1731,Holistic Survival Show,Wow! Just wow!,5,"Great quality show with a lot of cool things about longevity, healthy living, and, as the title suggests, holistic living too.

1734,Holistic Survival Show,It's NOT the End of the World as We Know It,5,"Trying to comprehend the meaning of holistic survival makes my brain hurt, so I don‚Äôt spend much time doing that. Still, this is a podcast to be reckoned with. Don‚Äôt be so quick to dismiss it as another version of The End of the World as We Know It Crowd, because it‚Äôs not. In addition to truly fascinating guests (look for G. Edward Griffin), host Jason Hartman is full of financial common sense about how to achieve the American Dream even if we‚Äôre mired in something less than all-out armageddon, which, to my way of thinking, seems a more realistic eventuality. Check out the Holistic Survival Show. You won‚Äôt have to drink Kool-Aid afterwards."
1735,Holistic Survival Show,Best show on survivalism,5,The tips here are splendid! I've learned so many tips to better my life!!!
1736,The Herb Nerd Podcast,LOVE LOVE LOVE!,5,"Just discovered and listened to my first episode today and absolutely love the information and the vibe! I have always loved plants, but only recently became interested in herbal medicine and therapy. I have a degree in horticulture and for over 20 years I have been growing plants to restore oil fields back to their native habitat... but was feeling like something was missing. As woo woo as this may sound, during a conversation with a medium who spoke with my angels, it is apparently my calling to heal people using plants as medicine üíó I am so excited about this podcast and it‚Äôs inspiration!"
1737,The Herb Nerd Podcast,Yes yes yes,5,"So, I‚Äôve been on the plant path for a solid 8 years so far- learning my wild edibles, learning my starting herbal remedies, but this podcast has been amazing. Not exaggerating when I say it‚Äôs changed my life. After listening to the menstrual activism show, i went out and got myself a sponge and so far. Only praise.

1766,Primal Diet - Modern Health,Love,5,Just listened to your podcast on cats and their health/diet. I am going to try the freeze dried foods with my two kitties.

1787,Primal Diet - Modern Health,Beverly Brings Bevy of Brilliant Biological Bits!,5,"Ok I am an admitted podcast addict. During workouts, rides in the car, doing dishes and laundry I am always tuning in. And Primal Diet Modern Health is, by FAR, my favorite. Not only does Beverly provide the latest scientifically valid information on Paleo (and beyond) diet and lifestyle, but she manages to resonate on so many points and literally makes me laugh out loud. Whoever said she is not funny needs to get a sense of humor! I always learn something when listening that either applies to my own health or one of my clients (I am an FDN Practitioner).

She is always giving out tidbits of information that may not be directly related to the topic at hand."
1791,Primal Diet - Modern Health,Needs Tweaking,3,"This podcast would be 100% better if Beverly would ask the question simply. She gives an explanation for why she has a question on a topic, offers several suggestions for poosible answers, and, then finally asks the question. She frequently forgets the question by the time she gets to the end of her explanation. JUST ASK THE QUESTION."
1792,Primal Diet - Modern Health,Compassionate & Detailed,5,"Beverly's podcast is tremendous for all the detail she gives of her discoveries over the past 40+ years of her health journey. I have learned things from her I have not heard elsewhere, and I am only on the July 2015 podcasts, having begun listening from her first episode in 2012.

1814,Know Your Food with Wardee,Incredible!,5,"All the knowledge that Wardeh shares is invaluable!
She offers the Class on Traditional Cooking, weekly Podcasts and writes a blog. I want to stress the importance of the class first because that is something that I benefited tremendously!
1) Class on Traditional Cooking
I consider myself the luckiest person to come across this class on traditional cooking in my early 30s! Wardeh teaches how to cook nutritionally dense and health promoting food. Having that knowledge, I can even make better choices in a supermarket and when I am dining out. So now I can say with confident that I am able to prepare the best food possible for my family. Make sure to check her online classes! You WILL NOT regret!
2) Podcast series
I have been listening to these podcasts with great pleasure, constantly learning something new from her and her guests. I don`t know how she is able to find all these guests, but she is really doing a great job! So much useful information!
3) Blog
I love her blog! OMG! SO informative and useful! Check it out and you will see it for yourself.
Overall, I would say these resources are the best on Traditional cooking and homestead living in the Internet! I would recommend her classes to everyone, so we all could get healthier and happier! Also stay up to date by listening to her podcasts.
P.S.: I can not be more grateful for all your work, Wardeh! Thank you for doing all this! Thank you!"
1815,Know Your Food with Wardee,Wonderful podcast!,5,"I clean houses as my part time job while I am in school and I love downloading and listening to Wardee's podcast while I clean. Now, I make all my own sourdough bread, tortillas, muffins, rolls, etc. because of her helpful and thorough Sourdough e-book. Every episode is full of helpful information and the interviews are always a pleasure to listen to as well. I highly recommend listening and always look forward to new episodes!"
1816,Know Your Food with Wardee,Real Food!!,5,"Nice podcast for learning about real food, from growing to storage to recipes."
1817,Know Your Food with Wardee,Great information!,5,"I'm happy to have found a podcast on traditional food and living that breaks things down into bite sized chunks. I like that she has a tip, answers a question, and then interviews someone on a topic. You get a lot of information in one podcast!"

1819,Know Your Food with Wardee,Must listen podcast!,5,"KYF delivers a wealth of information on topics related to traditional living. Wardee incorporates time honored tradition with current research to ensure credibility of information shared. For anyone interested in gaining more in-depth knowledge of traditional foods (such as Weston A. Price Foundation), Know Your Food should be among your ‚Äúmust listen podcasts!‚Äù Keep up the great work!"
1820,Know Your Food with Wardee,Life changing,5,Such a great resource for getting away from the Standard American Diet & back to living & eating the way God intended.
1821,Know Your Food with Wardee,Cant recommend enough!,5,"Wardee's podcasts make doing the dishes a PLEASURE for me. Before, kitchen cleanup was a chore I would procrastinate. Now I can't wait to have my clean up time with Wardee! :)
I can't even tell you how excited I am to join Traditional Cooking School. I learned that I had leaky gut while breastfeeding my first child. He developed horrible eczema and my chiropractor suggested I take a food sensitivity test - I was positive for almost everything! After 1 month of cutting my sensitive foods out his eczema was completely gone. I have since successfully added foods back into my diet but want to be very careful with how I prep them so I don't trigger my leaky gut again. This is especially important as our second child is coming in July! I certainly don't want to repeat the experience!
I've been watching the podcasts, trying the recipes, and reading the blog with an insatiable hunger for more. I have had Nourishing Traditions for years and even took a webinar hosted by Sally Fallon a few years ago, so the principles are familiar but the Traditional Cooking School site has helped me to practically apply them to my life.
Looking forward to learning all I can before this baby comes so traditional cooking is second nature to me!"
1822,Know Your Food with Wardee,I am forever grateful,5,You are good and kind to share your knowledge. I learn more each time I listen‚Äîand you really do make things so approachable. Thank you.

1825,Know Your Food with Wardee,Know Your Food,5,Enjoy listening or watching both of Wardee's podcasts. Educational and encouraging help for implementing healthy traditional cooking in our lives.
1826,Zenworlds ZenCast,Still one of the best!,5,Still listening after discovering three years ago and still stands out as one of the best even if not being updated. Thank you!
1827,Zenworlds ZenCast,Excellence,5,I have been listen to theses on and aft for about four years. They have helped me get through many rough patches in my life. Thanks !
1828,Zenworlds ZenCast,Incredible,5,"I can't say enough about how superb these meditations are and miss, miss you Jenny. When will you produce more? Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this service you have gifted us. There are so many meditations available on the podcasts but yours are by far the best. Thank you."
1829,Zenworlds ZenCast,Perfect,5,"These meditations have a wonderful, relaxed tone. At 10-20 minutes long, they are the perfect length for someone who wants to fit in a meditation or two throughout the day. Very helpful, positive guidance. I also love the tuning fork vibrations. Thank you!"
1830,Zenworlds ZenCast,Best Meditations on the Internet!,5,"Jenny is a truly beautiful person and her guided meditations are so genuine, you can't help but open up during one of her meditation sessions. They're fun and light-hearted but still manage to address and unlock those serious life blocks. I wouldn't make it through my week without them!"
1831,Zenworlds ZenCast,Where'd Jenny go?,4,"Overall, I would recommend this podcast to others. Sometimes I find Jenny's voice to be a little less than soothing. I think it's her Midwestern accent. Other than that, some of the meditations are a bit much for me, but there are some that I could not love more! In particular, I like the chakra balancing one and the six healing sounds meditation. They are mind-blowing! I think my problem with some of them is that they're too bodily for me. I like focusing on chakras more than my kidneys or spleen. I also don't like the one where you're supposed to open up the top of your head, because I don't like the idea of the hole in the top of my head! It creeps me out! That said, I have yet to listen to all of them and I look forward to doing so. Which brings me to my question, whatever happened to Jenny? Why did she stop doing the podcast? Of course, I'm not looking a gift-horse in the mouth, but I was just wondering! Thanks, Jenny, for posting these podcasts. It must be nice to know that you have brought meditation to so many people."

1845,Zenworlds ZenCast,Excellent Guided Meditations,5,This is an outstanding podcast that includes guided meditations and the use of tuning forks to balance chakras. Jenny does a great job!
1846,Zenworlds ZenCast,Melted the pain away,5,"Last week I broke my ankle, and woke up one morning at 3am with throbbing pain. Instead of taking a Vicodin, I listened to the #29 Pain Management meditation. After listening twice, the pain just melted away and I went back to sleep. While I sometimes feel mild discomfort, the throbbing pains have disappeared. Since I have five more weeks with a cast, the meditations are very helpful."

I feel so much better when I have listened to these meditations no matter how troublesome my day had been, I instantly relax!( which is very hard for me to do!)

1848,Zenworlds ZenCast,Very helpful and soothing Meditations,5,"I've been listening to Jenny's soothing voice and relaxing meditations for 3 1/2 years. I ALWAYS feel better after listening to one of her zencasts. They have helped me sleep better, feel better about my personal situation, and deal with stress better. I no longer need to take a sleep aid since ive been listening to her zencasts. Even Jenny's intro's are so right on with what/how I'm feeling that it just reassures me that I'm listening to the right meditation- and that she just gets it. Thank you Jenny for sharing so much with us. I wish you tons of love and light."
1849,Taking Back Birth,Maryn calms the mystery of not knowing,5,"I might be pregnant (first child!) while typing this - I‚Äôm not sure, but I don‚Äôt want to test for HCG. I‚Äôve been listening to Maryn‚Äôs wise words for years now (sorry I haven‚Äôt reviewed sooner!) & I‚Äôve re-listened twice or even thrice to most of her episodes. In this weird limbo of time where I feel I‚Äôm either waiting for blood or waiting for a sign of life, her voice & honesty & wisdom are so validating. Well, that‚Äôs always. But it feels particularly special being in the midst of the transition from (perhaps) maiden to mother. Thank you Maryn ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1850,Taking Back Birth,Forever grateful,5,I am so grateful for Maryn‚Äôs willingness to share her wisdom with the world via this podcast. My life has certainly been changed for the better as a direct result of listening to the info shared in this sacred virtual space.
1851,Taking Back Birth,"Educational, Honest, Not for the Faint of Heart",5,"Maryn and the inspiring guests she hosts are simply overflowing with scientifically backed information, spiritual insights, and experiences they share - all in the name of exposing the realities of birth in today‚Äôs world, and letting the listener figure out what to do with what they hear. This podcast is for people who are willing to challenge themselves and take an honest look at the world around them, it is NOT for people who are okay with unquestioningly accepting whatever ‚Äútruth‚Äù someone else hands them. It is life changing, inspiring, jaw-dropping, and even funny. Truly the best of its kind."
1852,Taking Back Birth,jussayin‚Äô,1,"i find the topics this podcaster has chosen to discuss regarding free birth/home births to be appropriate and educational. i entrust that the LISTENERS are willing audience members because of genuine interest in the topics discussed, members of the obstetric/midwifery/doula/birth support community, preparing or curious about ‚Äúother‚Äù birthing options, and/or perhaps currently hoping for a free birth/home birth for their own experience. with that said, the podcaster has willingly taken on a role of being an educator/supporter/confidante and ultimately an ADVOCATE for such an experience. a position in which should be upheld to an elite standard - one in which i disagree that she shall carry. i have found her ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù to be nothing short of her own experiences and one her stance to be awfully judgmental and potentially dangerous. a ‚ÄúFAVORITE‚Äù [insert eye roll here] statement that she had made in the past , when discussing cervical exams in labor : i can‚Äôt quote exactly, but along the lines of ‚Äúno one should have someone‚Äôs hand in their body every hour...‚Äù THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN ANY INSTANCE OF CHILDBIRTH ( not in a hospital or birth center, etc) . cervical exams are done ON OCCASION, with proper verbal consent (when provider/caregiver is PROVIDING the best care), for a multitude of reasons including BUT NOT LIMITED TO: PER CLIENT REQUEST, for assessment or concern of cord prolapse (or other concerns with placenta/cord), to ensure providers are giving the utmost care to laboring mother AND THE HUMAN BEING SHE IS BIRTHING that deserves THE UTMOST CARE as well, and for labor progress ( NOT TO RUSH THE PROCESS BUT TO, ONCE AGAIN, PROVIDE THE BEST CARE TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED ). of course there are more reasons than just those listed . again, great topic to discuss in a podcast forum , BUT HAVE SOME DECENCY AS A HUMAN BEING AND DON‚ÄôT MAKE SCENARIOS UP IN ORDER TO MAKE WHAT YOUR PASSIONATE ABOUT SOUND AS THOUGH IT IS THE ONLY RIGHT WAY OF DOING THINGS. the danger that can come from a vulnerable subscriber hanging on to every word in which you say could be catastrophic. you‚Äôre brave ( or , in my opinion, irresponsible) for saying some of the things you do."
1853,Taking Back Birth,Not impressed anymore,3,"Used to love this podcast however, I am deeply saddened and hurt by Maryn pointing fingers at Freebirth communities and calling them dogmatic, bullying them, and essentially getting the whole point of freebirth communities wrong. I find her to be feeling quite triggered by freebirth movements and it‚Äôs clear that she is afraid to be called into council with other women when called out on her assumptions."
1854,Taking Back Birth,Free birth episode,5,"First off! I absolutely love this podcast and have listened to most episodes! I also hope to attend your school in the future! In regards to the free birth episode, have you listened to ‚ÄúThe freebirth Society‚Äù podcast? I ask because Emily often mentions how most of the women would have preferred to have a traditional wise woman present, but that wasn‚Äôt an option, so they freebirthed. I think her podcast really captures the true essence of free birth :)"
1855,Taking Back Birth,Every pregnant person should hear these episodes,5,"While podcasts weren‚Äôt the cool thing 7 years ago when I was pregnant with my first, I would have been in amazing shape had I been able to hear so many of these words.
So blessed to have found indie birth and this podcast during my current pregnancy. Excited to birth in power armed with this information!"
1856,Taking Back Birth,BEST BIRTH PODCAST,5,Thank you so much for sharing all these wonderful podcasts with the world! I‚Äôve learned so much from every single one I‚Äôve listened to (which is almost all of them!). Your advocacy for women to trust their own intuition is something that I needed to hear and I feel is a strong theme throughout all the various episodes.
1857,Taking Back Birth,Life Changing,5,This is my favorite podcast and I listened to Mantras for Birth during my unassisted birth. Thank you for everything you do.
1858,Taking Back Birth,Thank you,5,"Thank you for your wisdom, Maryn. Grateful for this wonderful podcast."
1859,Taking Back Birth,Best podcast out there,5,I recommend these podcasts to any pregnant woman I can!! These are some of the most empowering options out there for pregnant women! So much good info to be heard and reflected upon. You got this ladies take back your birth and birth your way!
1860,Taking Back Birth,Healing and Transformational,5,"This podcast series has provided me with sacred knowledge, encouraged me to fight for what I believe in, and addressed so many issues of the birth world. It heals me to listen to Maryn‚Äôs empowering words and brings such joy to me. Indie Birth has allowed me to dive deeper within myself, to address my fears and become a wild, fearless woman when it comes to birth. Totally worth the listen ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1861,Taking Back Birth,Transformative and Inspiring,5,"Taking Back Birth is an excellent resource for birthing from a wise woman perspective. I highly recommend this podcast to all women, especially to those who are mothers, becoming mothers, and birth keepers!"
1862,Taking Back Birth,Indie Birth = Empowered Birth!,5,"My husband and I wish we could give this podcast ten stars! Maryn Green is not only extremely well-informed and wise, but she is also realistic and all-inclusive of every kind of experience a mama could have during childbirth. I never feel swayed to think one way when I listen to her episodes. I just feel relieved to have more knowledge, and especially empowered to have my own experience. This is my first pregnancy and my husband‚Äôs 9th of natural deliveries! He‚Äôs been through midwives, home births and a birth center, and even he‚Äôs blown away by the revolutionary mission and practices of Indie Birth."
1863,Taking Back Birth,Empowering women,4,"I am so grateful for all you've done for women on your journey getting this information out. I feel so empowered in my body for this birth after being encouraged to just look inside myself, a feeling I was almost suppressing before. Thank you more than I could ever express!"
1864,Taking Back Birth,Responsibility,5,"I am a Childbirth Educator and mama of 3 and I appreciate so many voices in the birth world and the knowledge and truth they point to. I feel that the truth the Maryn points to is the truth I am exploring, which is wholeheartedly taking responsibility for your life. I am on that journey and feel that birth is such a wonderful opportunity to claim ownership that leads to knowing and trusting yourself more deeply. I had 3 home births with CNMs who were absolutely amazing and life changing, and yet looking back I can see how even though I believed in myself and believed in birth I used their expertise as a buffer between my fears and really stepping into my power by owning my experience fully. I owned it 80%, but that 20% is really interesting to explore and this podcast explores so much about going within yourself during pregnancy, birth, and parenthood to connect with your feelings, desires, and instincts. As a culture we seek so much for expert advice not realizing we can be the experts on what is best for us. I love tha Maryn is bold enough to live her truth this way....truly inspiring!"
1865,Taking Back Birth,Love Maryn,5,Maryn sounds like a great person to have as a friend and she covers really useful information using a natural approach to pregnancy and childbirth. Thank you Maryn for putting this out!
1866,Taking Back Birth,KMR,5,"A great podcast to listen to when considering all of your birth options, and especially if you are ready to take control and be responsible for your own prenatal and postpartum experience. Love these ladies."
1867,Taking Back Birth,revolutionary work,5,"Great, honest, revolutionary information for expecting parents, student midwives or other birthworkers. The work Maryn and Margo are doing is so needed and important for women to reclaim their power in birth! <3 Thanks!"
1868,Taking Back Birth,Thank you Maryn and Margo,5,"Bless you for your passion and willingness to share this to the world.
-Angelica Cook"
1869,Taking Back Birth,Love this!,5,Keep em coming
1870,Taking Back Birth,First time mother eliminated fear and anxiety thanks to all this knowledge provided by Indie Birth,5,"As a first time mother, Maryn has truly helped me eliminate fear and anxiety from pregnancy and birth with educating me on the entire process!!! I am so thankful that I have found these podcasts and this community! My midwife is amazed that I don‚Äôt have a ton of questions- and that‚Äôs all thanks to Indie Birth and Taking Back Birth podcasts (I‚Äôve listened to them all!)!!"
1871,Taking Back Birth,Just Great!,5,So much good information presented in a reassuring and conversational manner. Have been listening for 3 years and 2 unassisted births. It has been so educational and helpful to me!
1872,Taking Back Birth,I've really enjoyed this podcast,5,"I'm a 3 time mom and looking for a less medicialized birth. I initially just listened to episodes that sparked my interest, but have now found myself digging in deeper & listening more. It's a nice change of pace than the typical scare tactics I feel most mothers hear, even when using a midwife in a birth center. Instead, were hearing what and why then pros and cons."
1873,Taking Back Birth,Loved the high risk post!,5,Thank you so much for your latest post. This is the first time I‚Äôm listening to your podcast and i has two high risk pregnancies- delivered my son at 34weeks with HELLP & delivered my daughter at 36weeks with IUGR. This is so encouraging to me to continue to have kids even when there is a chance to be ‚Äúhigh risk.‚Äù Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
1874,Taking Back Birth,Keeping it Real,5,I've listened to a few so far and I appreciate the honesty and the pace of the podcast- it's like Maryn is just speaking from her heart and just telling you what she thinks. Merging the spiritual with just common sense. Love it!
1875,Taking Back Birth,Best podcast for mothers,5,"Highly recommend any expecting mamas listen to these podcasts. The greatest lie ever told was that we woman are not capable of birthing a baby. You are, we are and thanks to people like indie birth things are changing!!!!
THANK YOU FOR BEING THE CHANGE AND OPENING OUR EYES ‚ù§Ô∏è
I am 37 weeks and feeling so much more empowered than my previous 2 births. I cry and process many fears and emotions through listening to your podcasts and they have been a godsend during this pregnancy. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x"

1879,Dearest Doula with Nathalie Saenz,Affirmed my choice to become a doula!!!,5,"Wow. I am so grateful to this podcast. This really gave me the *COURAGE* to commit to investing in a doula certification training, and gave me the dose of reality that I needed to hear in order to imagine myself doing birth work. I‚Äôve listened to every single episode, and although I was drawn to listening to most of the topics, I even learned something amazing from the episodes I was not all that jazzed about initially‚Ä¶ In other words, I never felt disappointed by a single guest because every guest had at least 1 amazing insight to offer, if not many. Thank you, Nathalie, for doing this amazing work for the birth community at large. And thank you to all the guests that stepped up to share their experiences as a birth workers! I‚Äôve been happily awaiting more episodes since Nov ‚Äò16, yet I understand Life Happens with a newborn ;) (This community of all communities should understand that!) PS. I‚Äôm interested in the Accountability Tribe and looking forward to inquiring further about it after I attend my first birth and feel a bit more engaged in my path as a doula."
1880,Dearest Doula with Nathalie Saenz,Inspiring Podcast,5,"I am really glad I found this podcast, because I am a new doula so I have been learning so much from all the episodes and guests.
I even got my calling to become a midwife while listening to Juli Tilsner's and Aubre Tompkins' episodes back-to-back coincidentally during my commute home several weeks ago. Since then, I started looking into the Cornerstone Midwifery Training program and accredited midwifery schools to start my journey. Thank you inspiring birth workers like myself and keep up the great work, Nathalie!"

This is SUCH a valuable resource for new and experienced birth workers alike!"

1963,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Remember this is a podcast,3,"There is some very good information on these podcasts, but his drinking water and talking about it so much is utterly irritating. I know this is a YouTube to podcast format, but he needs to remember that there are listeners out there that don‚Äôt need to hear him drink water all the time and talk about it. Other than that, it‚Äôs pretty interesting."
1964,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Top source for health related knowledge,5,Extreme Health Radio has become my top source for health related knowledge. Thank you!
1965,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,"Most guests are great, hosts are lacking",3,"I love the majority of the guests they have on the show. Very informative. However, the hosts could improve on their commentary. A lot of repeating ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs awesome‚Äù, ‚Äúso so great‚Äù. Justin asks a lot of good questions though he interrupts too much with his own stories and the intro is way too long and there is a lot of rambling on at the end. It seems every podcast, he can‚Äôt think of someone‚Äôs name or the name of a certain modality, etc. Eating/drinking on air is not pleasant to listen to and the exclaiming off how great the water is every time you take a drink. Very distracting and annoying."

1971,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Awesome interviews with johnBergman FANTASTIC,5,I have been researching and healing myself successfully naturally for years now but I have never come across anyone that knows how to heal everything NATURALLY UNTIL I STARTED LISTENING TO Dr John Bergman who you interview and ask awesome questions of him that the people listening would want answered. Thank you for having him on.. I just did a phone consult with him and he is better than any MD EVER!!! I encourage everyone to listen to him on your website and his you tube videos!

They have such a great relationship with each other and their listeners. They make me feel like I'm sitting with them having these conversations. I look forward to every single episode. Their guests have so much knowledge and wisdom. I feel blessed to hear all of this info. If it wasn't for J & K id be struggling to find like minds to get inspired by. I love the free for all Friday's. It really makes me feel like I know them personally. they always respond to listener questions so that helps the community they've created grow. I am very interested in health, which leads me to questioning the entire reality we are apart of and I love that aspect of the show where they entertain thoughts that might be a little edgy or maybe too woo woo ;) overall I'd give this podcast 100 stars :) Thank you Justin and Kate you guys have inspired me beyond belief.

Interesting guests discussing natural healing and related topics. I also enjoy their Free for All Friday shows where they talk about past interviews and whatever fun and whacky topics that may come up. They‚Äôre pretty much the neighbors I wish I had.
1975,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Love This Podcast!,5,"What i truly love about Justin and Kate (and Maggie) is they are REAL! When it comes to their show nothing is off limits and they question the health risks of virtually everything. They are very knowledgable and informative about issues that most wellness shows do not even delve into. They offer different perspectives on physical, mental & spiritual well being and their guests are highly insightful on a plethora of differing topics. I have learned a lot for this show and I am always entertained listening. I definately recommend this podcast to anyone interested in living a healthy lifestyle and learning how to avoid the poisons propagated by parasitic corporations. In the words of Justin, Extreme Health Radio is Really Cool and Awesome!!!!"
1976,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Best podcast of all time,5,I have learned an incredible amount of information from listening to this podcast on my drives. The diversity and quality of the guests on the show is unparalleled. Justin and Kate's curious and open nature makes it even more engaging. I always look forward to listening to the next episode!
1977,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Very Empowering Podcast,5,"I love this podcast! I‚Äôve been listening on and off for the past 3 years or so and every time I learn something incredibly insightful. What I love most is the variety of information. You sometimes get guests who contradict one another which is comforting to me knowing there‚Äôs no agenda. You listen, you learn, and then determine, for yourself, what the right path is which is why I find it in empowering. Yes, there‚Äôs a lot out there that‚Äôs constantly compromising our health but there is also solutions. This also my first and only podcast review so that should tell you how much I love them."
1978,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,The Best Health Podcast I Have Found,5,"These podcasts are really good! They are so helpful to me in learning about improving my health, with speakers that are highly skilled in natural medicine and/or are on the cutting edge of scientific research.
There are a lot of eye-openers here in these podcasts. They dispel many commonly-held beliefs that have been disproven through science or by successful health recovery for many people.
I'm interested in natural medicine that works to treat the cause of my health problems, not just treat or mask the symptoms, which is the usual standard of care in the conventional health industry."
1979,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,My most favorite podcast of all time!,5,"I found Extreme Health Radio while trying to fill some of my commute time with alternative health related content about a year ago. I look forward to every show. Justin & Kate are amazing! They interview some of the most intriguing and knowledgeable people.

1982,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Amazing!,5,A fantastic show. Its helped me bring my health awareness to higher levels! Great interviews and a tremendous range of topics covered. You rock extreme health radio!
1983,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,One Problem,1,"While I generally find the show interesting and entertaining, my problem with it, as I have expressed to Justin in the past, is that he does not challenge his guests to support the views they hold. I understand that his purpose is to show listeners that there are many alternatives to the mainstream and that is commendable. However, if the shows are really to be helpful to anyone, then some level of credibility must be established. Some of his guests present some very ""out there"" views (not to say that they may not be true) but when this is the case I believe it behooves Justin to not just ask questions about the treatment, therapy, etc., but to ask questions that require the guest to provide some real evidence about their efficacy."
1984,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Best Health Podcast!,5,"If you want to learn more about alternative medicines which are not mentioned at your doctors office, you have to give this podcast a chance. The guests are top class and I have learned more about health on this podcast than in all my years of study."
1985,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Valuable Open Forum For Health Ideas,4,"The wide variety of guests and topics makes EHR a worthwhile podcast to have in your feed. Justin and Kate bring an openness and enthusiasm to their interviews, making it enjoyable to learn along with them. Not everything every guest says can be taken as gospel, but it is nice to have an open forum for so many interesting ideas about health and wellness."
1986,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,Something New to learn every show,5,Extreme Health Radio has so many viewpoints and topics that there is somthing new to learn every show.

1989,Podcasts ‚Äì Extreme Health Radio,This nurse's go to for everything health-related!!!,5,"Absolutely love this podcast! It's the only one I subscribe to and listen to consistently. As a nurse and patient advocate, I'm constantly looking for alternative theories and treatments for myself, my family and my clients. This podcast and the Extreme Health Radio website have opened my mind to so many options. Western medicine is amazing in so many respects, but it doesn't do an effective job in addressing the chronic disease that we're plagued with today. Extreme Health Radio helps me fill in the gaps and implement things that will help prevent chronic disease and augment treatment for those in the thick of it. The topics are balanced across mind, body and spirit, technology, simplicity and even some downright bizarre! The conversation style is easy and relatable. Take what speaks to you and leave the rest behind. Search for a topic that interests you and give it a listen. I so appreciate what Justin and Kate are doing and to show it, I support them by using their Amazon site for making all my purchases. My sincerest thanks and my highest recommendation!"

2011,How To Get Healthy And Get Pregnant,The BEST Podcast About All Things Fertility!!!,5,"I am a podcast junkie, so naturally when I was trying to get a regular cycle and get pregnant, I listened to this podcast weekly and looked forward to new episodes coming out. All the useful and informative tips coupled with Adrienne's relatable and realistic approach made this my favorite fertility-related podcast. While listening one day, I heard about Adrienne's Facebook group with the same name and eagerly joined. It was so great to be part of a commuity of like-minded women trying to get pregnant, and I learned even more through the group. When Adrienne was answering questions one day on Facebook Live, I decided to submit a question about my personal fertility challenges. She answered my question so beautifully and thoroughly that I knew I wanted to work with her one-on-one. Long story short, after about two months of working together, I got pregnant and now have a healthy two month old baby boy! And this was after being on birth control pills for over 10 years and not having a period for three years once I went off. I could not have done it without Adrienne's help. As an added bonus, I experienced many other health benefits from implementing her diet and lifestyle recommendations and had a very healthy and relatively easy pregnancy and delivery. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone interested in fertility, pregnancy, and/or hormonal balance. I also highly recommend working with Adrienne or joining her Practically Fertile program - not only will you get pregnant, but you'll very much enjoy working with a coach who is incredibly relatable, thorough, responsive, and knowledgeable. Adrienne is simply the best!!!"
2012,How To Get Healthy And Get Pregnant,Ready to Get Pregnant? Adrienne Has You Covered,5,"It wasn't until I met Adrienne and started listening to her podcast episodes and digesting ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE information and tips from her webinars, programs and freebies that I finally was able to get pregnant with my second child. Unfortunately, I had previously assumed it would be ""easy"" the second time around, and boy, was I mistaken. It took the direction of Adrienne for me to truly understand my body and the things I was doing on a daily basis that were preventing me from conceiving. Finally, after taking the lessons and tips I learned from Adrienne, I was able to understand my period, learn when my window was for optimal fertility/ ovulation and how to prepare my body to be as fertility friendly as possible. Her passion and dedication to families TTC is evident in every interaction with her (and her staff at Inner Peace Acupuncture) and I can truly say that without a doubt, Adrienne's guidance and presence in my life helped us to finally conceive our soon to be baby boy. I will be forever grateful for the kindness, compassion and direction of Adrienne Wei <3"

I've learned SO much, these podcasts have given me the guidance I was looking for to get through this condition, and have taught me essential things about the body and mind every person on earth should know!! The information I've learned has honestly changed my life, and will stay with me long after my SIBO's gone. :)"
2034,The Healthy Gut,Foundational Podcast to my Broader SIBO Journey,5,"I came to The Healthy Gut Podcast well after my SIBO journey began. In fact, I‚Äôd just cleared the ravages of SIBO and was in the midst of healing the damage to my body when I became a listener. That said, Rebecca‚Äôs interviews have proven as timeless as they are insightful and I‚Äôve learned immense amounts about this condition, the state of SIBO research and treatment, what the future might look like, and how I can continue healing and hedging against relapse. Perhaps most important, how to reconcile the condition with my past and current perception of self. (I don‚Äôt think any of is see ourselves with a chronic illness. Also, is it chronic? Time will tell. üòÜ)
With a sharp mind, a quick wit, and a heart as big as Texas, Rebecca blends mind, body, and spirit into a whole package that makes you feel like you have someone in your corner, even though she‚Äôs just in your ears. Truly, I was still measuring my calories and shaking like a leaf when I first began listening and her voice alone calmed me in ways I can‚Äôt express. I‚Äôve since marveled at, and been filled with gratitude about, what is surely a labor of love as she brings to light everything from Dr. Pimentel‚Äôs latest research to managing grief to thriving in spite of it all. Thank you Rebecca, and thank you to all of her guests, for sharing a bit of yourself/ves with all of us. The podcast has become foundational to my broader healing efforts as I continue peeling back the layers of this mysterious condition and how that all translates into living well."
2035,The Healthy Gut,Listening in the car,5,Hi Rebecca! I‚Äôve started listening to your podcasts on the car. You have an uncanny ability to know just what I would like to ask your guests. Thanks for supporting the rest of us!
2036,The Healthy Gut,Dr. Pimentel,5,I really loved learning about SIBO( Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth) and IBS from the Worlds leading researcher/ MD. Rebecca's podcasts are very informative and easy to understand. She asks the experts what we would ask them as if we were there. Great Podcast!
2037,The Healthy Gut,My favorite podcast!,5,"I just want to say that this podcast has improved my quality of life on so many levels! I have high methane sibo, I have been a patient of Dr. Sandberg-Lewis for about a year. Since I first started this podcast up until now I have learned so much it‚Äôs crazy! Every podcast I learn something new, and I have so many aha moments! It‚Äôs a great tool in anyone‚Äôs journey through sibo, or gut healing. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be where I am in my healing process today without Rebecca‚Äôs help."
2038,The Healthy Gut,Abundance of Wealthy Knowledge!,5,This Podcast excites me greatly! Thank you for having a podcast so specific as Gut health! I am a gut health thirsty individual and I'm thrilled by your valuable content! I loved listening to the interview about Mindset with Kristin. Reminders: check in with the role you give yourself..is it helathy or unhealthy. If the people around you are still stuck in claiming you're still the sick person you used to be..stake your claim of the new! Might need to remind people as well as yourself about the new healthy person you have become. Cheers to celebrating new healthy ways of living! CaraF13

I highly recommend this podcast to anyone looking to optimize their gut health, and thus their health in general!"
2040,The Healthy Gut,Great gut health information,5,"I started listening to this podcast because a close friend of mine has SIBO and I wanted to learn more about the condition. In addition to learning about SIBO, I've learned a lot about my own gut, how it all works, and how I can take a few steps to make it a little healthier (every little helps, right!). Rebecca is easy to listen to and seems to have a real passion for health, which kind of gets you revved up about your own. Recommended listening."

2042,The Healthy Gut,Awesome Learning Opportunity,5,"I was diagnosed with Sibo about a year and a half ago. Since then, I have had a couple replapses. I really want to learn all I can about this condition so I have the knowledge to prevent future relapses. The Healthy Gut has been such a wealth of knowlege with all aspects of sibo. I love how Rebecca includes information about awareness, movement, nutrition, mindset, etc. I also love, love, love her cookbooks.

Ashlie covers topics that are so deeply relevant to me while remaining universally accessible. The episodes are long enough to allow you to fully tap into a state of peace and stillness, but are short enough to do on your lunch break or as part of a morning or bedtime routine. I have found Ashlie‚Äôs emphasis on gracefully letting go of attachments to expectations or judgments particularly impactful, and my relationship with my self continues to improve the more I reflect on the message of this podcast.

She speaks a a great pace; she's easy to understand, and it feels like she's sitting in my kitchen talking me through my next project.

2110,The Asana Academy Podcast,Love you show,5,I have more understanding of yoga just by listening to your podcasts. You give sound advise and are very good in breaking down poses. I am trying to learn how to do handstand and I appreciate you going through the process thoroughly. I really enjoy listening to your podcast.
2111,The Asana Academy Podcast,Outstanding Resource for Yoga,5,"Brian is one of the smartest and most complete yoga teachers I have come across. He's erudite, funny, and extremely intelligent. I love how he's unapologetically himself but also has a passion for helping people which really comes through. I also highly recommend his Body Breakthrough course which I'm currently enrolled in. It's the first time I've done anything like it and it is one of the best investments I have ever made on so many levels, not just physical strength but mental and spiritual transformation. Definitely subscribe and support this guy - he is the real deal."
2112,The Asana Academy Podcast,One of my favorite podcasts!!!,5,Love listening to the podcasts whenever I am in the car or on the go! Brian shares incredible information during each one.. he has helped take my handstand and L sit to a whole new level!
2113,The Asana Academy Podcast,Love the podcast,1,I love this podcast and have been binge listening for the past week and can‚Äôt get enough. Every person into yoga should make this a must listen. Thank you so much for doing this.
2114,The Asana Academy Podcast,Good podcast,5,Very helpful information
2115,The Asana Academy Podcast,YES LOVE ASANA ACADEMY,5,Great info from an experienced and knowledgeable teacher. He's got anatomy DOWN. This podcast is really helpful for yoga teachers or any yogi for that matter. üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüíØüíØüíØüôåüèºüíÉüèºüï∫üèº
2116,The Asana Academy Podcast,"Good info, but not about yoga",3,"I like this podcast for exercise science. Brian has some great
Info- but always seems to stop short before it become relevant to me. Every single podcast seems to be focused on handstands. My clients do not care about handstands, nor do they have any specific athletic goals.
They are seniors, those with
MS, Parkinson's or back pain. Most of them just want pain relief. I listen hopeful and get a glimpse of
Brian's knowledge but he always seems to stop short of giving specific ideas for results and transitions to handstand goals. Yoga isn't about physical goals, it's about wellness in spirit mind and body. Still, it's obvious he has extensive knowledge in anatomy. I just wish he would talk about yoga."
2117,The Asana Academy Podcast,"Very well thought out, detailed advice for advancing your yoga practice",5,"He clearly has a good understanding of body mechanics, and has spent countless hours on the mat. My only criticism is perhaps he could be a tad more succinct, but overexplaining is always better than underexplaining..."
2118,The Asana Academy Podcast,"Informative, relevant and fun!",5,This is an exceptional podcast with an emphasis on yoga arm balances. Great interviews. Recommended!
2119,The Asana Academy Podcast,5-star !!,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this podcast. Jam packed with USEFUL info that I can use right away in my practice. I was skeptical that I could get so much help online, I thought that an in-person instructor was necessary. I was wrong!! And I like that the podcasts are short. Perfect!!"
2120,The Asana Academy Podcast,valuable yoga info,5,"i wish this podcast had been around when i first became a yoga teacher. learning lots of sound, insightful tips and advice. thank you for generously sharing your knowledge with all of us!"
2121,The Asana Academy Podcast,Awesome advise!,5,"I have been taking Brian's classes for a while now, but recently got the means to listen to his podcasts during commute. The more detailed advise is awesome! For instance I recorded myself in handstand and realized how much I was leaning to the left. I felt totally straight and had no idea!"
2122,The Asana Academy Podcast,Instant Fan!,5,"I was reluctant to spend 30 minutes to an hour listening to a podcast about yoga (because after all yoga is about the practice, not listening to someone talk about it) but I was immediately hooked. I‚Äôm really impressed with the quality of guests and the discussion topics. My drive home in traffic is actually enjoyable as I listen intently to this podcast. After listening to only a few of these via Brian's newsletter, I subscribed and downloaded them all. You won‚Äôt regret the time you spend on these. I‚Äôve never met Brian (or even heard of him until I saw one of his blog posts shared by a FB friend). I was intrigued, I clicked, and now here I am writing the first iTunes review I‚Äôve ever done. That‚Äôs how much I enjoy these episodes. Thank you, Brian, for the time and effort you put into these podcasts and your blog. It is appreciated!"
2123,The Asana Academy Podcast,Great Information,5,"Hey there, the podcast is great! Full of practical, nuts-and-bolts info for how to work toward difficult poses, especially inversions. This is the sort of information I've been able to piece together bit-by-bit, from various sources -- usually calisthenic-specific sites -- but it's not usually presented so well to an audience of yoga practitioners."
2124,The Asana Academy Podcast,Great show,5,Love the topics
2125,The Asana Academy Podcast,great tips!,5,With all this information I really want to practice engaging my core so it becomes natural. I think it will help in my yoga practice as well as strengthening my lower back muscle to help with back pain I experience often. Thanks Brian!
2126,The Asana Academy Podcast,Positive and practical!,5,"Thank you for teaching, Brian!"
2127,The Asana Academy Podcast,Exactly what I was looking for,5,"So helpful, very knowledgable, succinct, inspiring. Love!"
2128,The Asana Academy Podcast,Extraordinary Podcast!,5,"Brian provides honest, inspirational, and helpful advice and ideas. I have used many of the suggestions --about both the physical practice and tactical ideas for teaching-- and have seen instant positive results. Thanks for the extraordinary podcast!!"
2129,The Asana Academy Podcast,Amazing Podcast,5,Brian is great. He breaks down intimidating body poses that most people only dream about into small achievable goals. He will also reply to your email if you are stuck on something.
2130,The Asana Academy Podcast,Love this podcast!,5,I'm a little behind but I am bingeing all the episodes and I am loving all the advice! Thanks!
2131,The Asana Academy Podcast,Great advice,5,"I just recently discovered this podcast and have gone back to the beginning. Brian offers a lot of great, practical advice in a easy to listen to manner."

2133,The Asana Academy Podcast,LOVE this podcast!,5,"I'm a brand new yoga teacher and I cannot get enough of this podcast. Soooo much valuable info and delivered in a very casual, easy to absorb way. Highly recommend!"
2134,The Asana Academy Podcast,Awesome yoga engineering,5,"Brian does an awesome job at explaining the feel of advanced yoga positions. Also, he breaks down difficult postures using scientific problem solving. I have listened to each podcast at least twice and learn something new each time I listen. Thanks Brian!"
2135,The Asana Academy Podcast,So many answers!,5,"As a new-ish yoga teacher (2.5years) and full time job-er, this wisdom on the go (in my car, at work, or on a jog) is so invaluable. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge for my students and myself, but having time to get to yoga retreats or workshops isn't always an option. This is a GREAT way to grow my wisdom in so many more ways. Thank you Brian for sharing your heart!"
2136,The Asana Academy Podcast,Hamstrings,5,"Great job explaining the ""Process"" of opening the Hamstrings. Being a Cycle Instructor in a gym 4-5 days a week, my Hamstrings are really tight. It's been a slow process, but I keep at it, twice a week I try to work this area for 30 minutes"
2137,The Asana Academy Podcast,"i follow on instagram & email, JUST found the podcast!",5,"i'm THIS CLOSE to pressing up and episode 042 on hamstring stretching might put me over the top... i'm 6'4"", 240lbs, & i turn 50 this summer. age doesn't matter nor does extra height. i've been upside down for 3 years and following brian agnad for the past year or so has helped clean up bad technique developed by learning without a teacher.

2159,Gluten Free School Podcast,She is so into herself.,1,Sometimes the host makes every little detail a huge deal. There is a great need for self importance that is rather difficult to listen to. Loud and self righteous ! People...simply make the changes that you need...end of story. No drama necessary.
2160,Gluten Free School Podcast,Thank you,5,"Thanks for all the info you're providing. I don't have Celiac Disease, but my fianc√© does. I'm constantly trying to read up on everything that I can to better understand it and what she's going through. Great stuff!!"

2162,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Fantastic Podcast with Amazing Guests,5,So much helpful information for thyroid patients! McCall is a great speaker and the topics covered are informative and inspiring.
2163,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Disappointing,1,Not to beat a dead horse but the most annoying podcast. The guest seemed annoyed as if he really didn‚Äôt want to be doing it. Off topic too much.
2164,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Awful!!!,1,This is hands down the worst podcast I‚Äôve ever listened to! Super annoying and can‚Äôt sit through the giggling and horrible sound quality to even get to any useful info
2165,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Terrible,1,Really wanted to hear Mcall talk:( 1 of the podcasters didn‚Äôt know what she was doing and the other talked about herself the whole time! Terrible and very annoying
2166,Thyroid Nation RADIO,"Great podcast, but too much access!!",3,"Please stop talking to each other and get to the point quicker. Most people don‚Äôt have an unlimited amount of time.
Great information and I love your topics and and guests, but please cut the extra stuff."
2167,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Great information,3,"I‚Äôd like to thank the hosts for creating this podcast. I‚Äôve learned from the many healers in this show that not only do I pay attention to my physical health, but my spiritual immunology needs to be addressed as well. So I do not come to you in anger; that being said, it is very difficult to listen to your show. I cannot listen to the interrupting of the guests, and all the side comments and chat talk.
All the best, your fellow Thriver ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2168,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Way off topic,1,"I listened the the recent episode on intermittent fasting. It wasn‚Äôt until almost 40 minutes into the podcast that they finally spoke about it. Also, with four speakers on, it was very difficult to follow the conversation. Even the participants seemed confused by each other and would often talk over each other. It just felt very unprofessional and left me feeling frustrated."
2169,Thyroid Nation RADIO,"Good topics, bad quality",2,The content and topics in the podcast are interesting. But it‚Äôs hard to get past the poor sound quality and lack of any editing. I‚Äôve listened to several episodes and even with it turned all the way up I can‚Äôt hear everything said.
2170,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Thyroid Nation,5,I really enjoy this podcast. They have super informative guests and the topics are pertinent to what is going on in my life.
2171,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Terrible,1,"Giggling like teens, and terrible sound quality. One of the worst podcasts I have listened to. Ever."
2172,Thyroid Nation RADIO,This is pseudo science,1,The information contained in this podcast is not factual. It is based on anecdotal and sometimes imaginary benefits of erroneous remedies. This should be considered entertainment in the same way you would consider the advice from an astrologer.
2173,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Informative,5,"I was diagnosed with hypothyroid 3 years ago and have struggled tremendously, gaining 30lbs., extreme brain fog, bad dreams and puffy face. Even though I've taken care of myself, things don't seem to change. This podcast has really helped me understand some of the symptoms of hypothyroid and it has informed me on great remedies as well. I found this podcast a relief because I discovered that ppl have similar symptoms as me even when their test results come out fine. I like the natural remedies they provide and I am preparing myself to try them out. Listening has motivated me to do my own research and coming up with a ""Game Plan"" on how to defeat my thyroid issues."
2174,Thyroid Nation RADIO,A Must Listen!!!!,5,"As someone who is new to the Thyroid journey, Thyroid Nation Radio has provided me with such a wealth of knowledge about my condition that has served to help me deal with my physicians and my everyday living. Working under the powerful belief that no two people's journeys are the same, they give a neutral platform for people from all different camps of Thyroid protocols, and educate without being preachy. From Hypo to Hyper, Hashimoto to Graves and everything in between, Danna and Tiffany touch on all things Thyroid: medication, nutrition, exercise, challenges, triumphs, advances, family concerns and of course, those flower field moments. Their goal is all about the healing, so whether you are new to this, like me, or have years of Thyroid issues under your belt, Thyroid Nation Radio is an amazing resource for us all."
2175,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Unprofessional,1,I love the topics and guests. Unfortunately the hosts are incredibly unprofessional. They ask questions that have previously been answered. Sometimes I wonder if they are even paying attention to their guests. The sound quality is bad and the giggling and banter is a huge put off.
2176,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Can‚Äôt miss,5,"This podcast is a who‚Äôs who of thyroid experts. It has helped me so much in my thyroid journey when dealing with un-cooperative conventional doctors, I feel like these two ladies are on my side teaching me along the way. I never miss a show!"
2177,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Poor Sound Quality and Woo,1,"This podcast has very poor sound quality and promotes woo cures for those suffering with various thyroid issues. The products and protocols they promote are full of pseudoscience and are backed with anecedotal evidence. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially if you are newly diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. Listen to and work with your doctor to normalize your thyroid levels."
2178,Thyroid Nation RADIO,LET YOUR GUESTS SPEAK!!!,2,"I really tried to like this show as there can be guests that have great information. HOWEVER!!! The hosts of the show consistently get off topic by interjecting their own personal stories and experiences, giggling, talking over each other, and are overall just very distracting. The hosts seem to believe this show is about them and revolves around them...NEWS FLASH...your subscribers tune in to hear the information that your GUESTS have to share. Please stop or considerably limit the amount of time you interrupt, giggle, get off topic, and redirect the conversation so it's about you; this would make your show SO MUCH BETTER!"
2179,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Good podcast but...,3,"I like the content of this podcast really well, but the sound is awful. I listen to a lot of podcasts and this one has the worst sound quality. It's not that hard to get a good microphone. Please consider upgrading the sound."
2180,Thyroid Nation RADIO,"Fun, Upbeat and FULL of Wonderful Thyroid Tips",5,"This is a show I look forward to listening to every week. The hosts are fun and don't droll on like most of the other podcast hosts. The guests are top notch and the information is second to none. If you suffer with thyroid or autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto's, like myself, this is a fabulous place to start for your healing journey! Thanks!"
2181,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Must listen,5,This is great for some one who is newly diagnosed with thyroid disease. Lots of great information.
2182,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Ask Listener Questions,4,"This is a good podcast to listen too. But, everyone listening has there own problems too. I think Danna and Tiffany only ask the speaker questions to help themelves. Which I know others have, but other thyroid patents have more, or don't have thyroids. These people need help also. I think they should have questions that other thyroid patents have to ask different speakers. Post on Facebook questions to ask speakers in the future."
2183,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Horrible sound quality,1,"Great guests and topics, but the hosts don't do a good job and the sound quality, feedback, and delays are horrible."
2184,Thyroid Nation RADIO,unvetted guests,1,"I can't believe you would let David Borenstein on your show! He is a greedy charlatan and a terrible doctor who has contempt for his patients and for his role as clinician. I was treated by his one-size-fits-all combination of super-high dose of Naturethroid, adrenal supplements, and nystatin for yeast. I ended up way sicker than when I went in-- his treatment protocol turned my mild hypothyroid to full-on hyperthyroid and the nystatin gave me abnormally high liver enzymes -- a common side effect which he never explained to me could happen. He had me do hundreds of dollars of bloodtests, the results of which he never even looked at or discussed with me. I have found other patients who were treated as badly. I can't believe this guy is still in business and passing himself off as an expert. He's only interested in making money. He deserves Zero respect and you undermine your credibility by having him as a guest on your show."
2185,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Could be better,2,I want to like this podcast but I struggle with the sound quality. The giggling hosts drive me crazy! I'm all for having a good time but be more professional. Come on - this could be so much better!
2186,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Poor sound,1,"Couldn't bear listening despite the valuable information. The technology required for better sounding podcasts is well within the reach of the amateur so I feel they just don't care all that much about good production, and this hurts the shows popularity pretty badly I think."
2187,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Good concept. Poor execution,1,It seems I'm not the only one who finds the hosts talking over each other and the guest as well as the giggling very distracting and annoying. The sound quality is substandard. I have tried to listen but just can't take it.
2188,Thyroid Nation RADIO,Amazing info,5,"I am so thankful for this podcast. It gives so much insight from experts we wouldn't otherwise have access too. It is extremely helpful to those of us who are suffering from thyroid problems. I have learned so much from their podcast. The hosts are bubbly and giggly and it's extremely cute. The sound quality isn't the best sometimes, though but overall the information is worth tuning in for!"

2191,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,Rate,3,Loved your podcast. Would have given you a five but Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a male. A brilliant apologist whom was killed by Hitler. Surely I misunderstood you.

2195,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,First ever learning about TM,5,I have often wondered about TM. I was searching for an intro.

I am about to sign up for my first TM class to give it a try. More to follow!
2196,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,"Insightful, Helpful",5,"For anybody who has ever studied or practiced meditation, you are aware of how many different techniques there are, and how exciting and challenging each technique can be.
Morgan Dix presents it all. He interviews a wide range of experts and everyday practitioners. We listeners get to profit from it all, to learn, grow and develop our own practice from what we individually gather from each episode. There‚Äôs both great science and spirituality contained throughout the variety of episodes.
Morgan Dix is a great host. Clearly he‚Äôs a good listener, asks poignant questions and is open and unassuming with all his guests.
I don‚Äôt think it matters who you are, what your particular belief system is, or how long you‚Äôve been meditating, or if you don‚Äôt meditate at all and are just interested‚ÄîI think you‚Äôll profit from listening to even just a few of these podcasts.
Joe. (Columbus, Ohio)"

2201,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,"Mindful, soothing, chill, insightful",5,"This is a review about OM51: How to Nurture Mindful Relationships. FIrst of all I find Morgan's voice to be very soothing, chill and honest. This is the first one mind podcast I've heard. I liked that Morgan shared anecdotal stories from his own relationships. Thanks for the reminder to pause and allow intense feelings to defuse before responding in the heat of an argument! And also so important: making space for each other's perspectives whether we agree or not. I look forward to listening to more of your podcasts!"
2202,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,Aaaaaah‚Ä¶ (Those are angels singing.),5,"This is an incredible podcast hosted by a man with a voice that was delivered by angels. l‚Äôm a new listener, but am catching up.

2203,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,Life Changer!,5,"I started meditating Jan ‚Äô16! I am 37, have 3 kids 17, 12, and 7 and a wonderful wife. I also have 4 dogs, 8 chickens, work 8 hours a day, coach softball and compete in Archery as well! I stated all that to let people know that they can make time to take the time to practice this wonderful and powerful tool we have. Two or Three days after beginning or attempting to meditate I came across this podcast because I was already listening to Joe Rogans podcast. He talk about meditation and I then went looking and found Morgan and that was amazing find this podcast.
Morgan really takes the time and effort in getting in great guests on his shows and really explains the ins and out on meditation. In less then 3 months I think I have listened to majority of them all because they are so enlightening.
The only thing I can add is that I wish I would have known about this amazing tool years ago. With you Morgan and everyone else in the mindfulness community, I appreciate everything you are doing to make this more and more available to people with guided meditations and just learning and better understanding the purpose and the ways to go about meditating.
Thank you so much!"
2204,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,Right for our times,5,"I listen to the the OneMind Meditation Podcast and I‚Äôve been interviewed by Morgan. As a long time meditator I find it powerfully resonant. Meditation and mindfulness are too often couched within framework that seems embedded in a very far away place and a very far away time. But meditation is a practice for OUR times, it is what the species needs if we are going to take that evolutionary leap. Morgan gets it, and this podcast gets us there."

2215,The OneMind Meditation Podcast with Morgan Dix: Meditation | Mindfulness | Health,Relating to others in meditation,5,"I started meditating when I realize that I had uncontrollable anxiety Back in July of 2017. I was two month in working for a Tesla, a big company changing the world for the better and eyes are always on you. For some reason I could not take that and I was at the point of quitting because my anxiety was out of control. But I stuck it out, been meditating as a beginner for about 15-20min everyday since and I still work for Tesla. Hearing your podcast and the people that you interviewed so far is amazing. To hear their story, why they started meditating and their practice to better their meditation shows that my meditation can get better.

2219,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Love this podcast,5,This podcast is real and not scripted. This is a combination of so many topics. You won‚Äôt get board listening to all the various show topics.
2220,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Surprisingly... PROFOUND! üò≤üëç,5,"Just listened to ep: 109 Ex-Ex-Vegans, Pt 1.
I‚Äôve never learned SO MUCH from ONE podcast!
* Racial/Cultural/Class/Body-Image Discrimination - in Vegan/Animal Activist Communities & Work Places!
* PTSD/Mental Health‚Äôs influence on a person‚Äôs Vegan/Activist/Sexual - Identity and Social Interactions/Relationships!
* The [no but really!] Importance of Educating yourself on The Vegan Diet/Lifestyle ESPECIALLY for Women! #Iron üí°
* [Mis-]Educational/Societal/Familial Peer Pressures and Influences on vegan-identifying individuals who are otherwise isolated from the community.
* Oh, and I even learned about Gender Diversity in Drag-Queen Culture! üëç
All from Pt1 of a Interview-Centric type episode of an all around entertaining, educational and just FUN podcast encapsulated in its very wise, talented and open-hearted/minded host Ms. Honey LaBronx (Ben Strothmann).
To sum up; I Highly Recommend this podcast and encourage support for it, and the many endeavors of its lovely host.
üòäüëç"
2221,Big Fat Vegan Radio,If Ben could stop chewing that would be great,2,"The 100th episode did it for me, Ben was just rude and it grossed me out. This pretty much becomes the Ben show once Laura starts living in a castle. You will be a little lost if you don‚Äôt care for drag. I loved the personalities but it‚Äôs just morphed into a hot mess. There isn‚Äôt structure and at this point Ben should just have a podcast of just his life because he‚Äôs very like-able but BFVR isn‚Äôt really a thing anymore"
2222,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Love it,5,Great podcast
2223,Big Fat Vegan Radio,I'm in!,5,"I'm starting with the first episode, but I already can't wait for the next 87. This is a great lifestyle podcast for the average vegan. They cover all topics and make great recommendations!"
2224,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Awesome!,5,"This an awesome podcast, even if you are not a vegan."
2225,Big Fat Vegan Radio,great podcast,5,been enjoying this podcast. Think it has some really great information. It's straightforward and enjoyable to listen to. Definitely recommend!
2226,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Awesomeness!,5,"Girl! Ben and Laura are amazing. This podcast is informative, funny, and honest. I love how 'real' they are, not preachy or elitist. Be prepared to laugh out loud. Go Vegan!!!"
2227,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Love it!!!,5,"I've been vegan for a month!! The show is hilarious and the hosts are awesome people who really work tirelessly for animal rights and are all around cool people!
Check the show out!!
XOXOXOX!"
2228,Big Fat Vegan Radio,It makes me purrrrr,5,"This is definitely the most entertaining vegan podcast available. The hosts are passionate about what they do, informative about the information they share, and ever so entertaining! I absolute adoooore them!"
2229,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Love This Podcast!,5,This podcast is the must have for those new or not-so-new to the vegan lifestyle. These two are a treasure to listen to and are very knowledgeable. They are always so positive and give so much good advice!
2230,Big Fat Vegan Radio,"not for the ""uninitiated""",2,"The following is my opinion and observation only, your mileage may vary:
This show is neither helpful nor informative to those who are not already fully embracing the vegan lifestyle in larger cities. Nor is it meant for nor aimed at those who do not live in either New York City OR San Francisco. Flyover state vegans are ignored at best or dismissed at worst. The hosts idea of living what is allegedly a compassionate lifestyle is to advocate harassment and bullying of anyone who does not instantly and wholeheartedly believe their rigid idea of what is or is not acceptable to veganism. If you wish to adopt a completely plant-based diet for any other reason than the most severe and hypocritical political agenda, this is not the podcast for you."
2231,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Thank you BFVR!,5,"Being Vegan for only three months I was so overwhelmed by the resources and kindness of this community. After finding this podcast, I found a centralized place to get hysterically funny, brutally honest and accurate information. You guys make my day that much brighter. And remember...Go Vegan!!"
2232,Big Fat Vegan Radio,A wonderful podcast !!!!,5,":) usually I don't like interviews, but they do them well, and I love the hisses and purrs segment !!!!! Love you Big Fat Vegan Radio:)"

2235,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Veg-Tabulous,5,"Thank you Ben and Laura for your Podcast, you guys are absolutely hilarious. Such a refreshing and informative podcast, I enjoy every minute of it!!!!"
2236,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Wonderful!,5,"I have only listened to the first podcast, and I LOVE it. As a lonely vegan with no vegan or vegetarian friends, I'm finding myself saying ""Yes!"" to the things that Laura and Honey say. I've been vegetarian for 10 years and vegan on and off for that time, and I'm definitely going back to vegan for the rest of my life. Vegetarian just isn't enough. <3 Vegans!"

I have been vegetarian for five years, and after listening to this podcast I am officially vegan as of November 1st 2014. BFVR is addictive; I only found it a few months ago and tore threw all of the episodes nonstop. I wish I could afford to be a member so I could have access to the secret shows! Ben and Laura are hilarious and have such an adorable dynamic together. I feel personally invested in their friendship! They are so positive and witty, and I love that they don't take themselves too seriously so that every episode has a major element of spontaneity, humor and fun that you don't get from many other shows. Their excitement about veganism is amazingly inspiring, and I'd recommend this podcast to anyone who is even remotely interested in animal rights and the veg movement."
2248,Big Fat Vegan Radio,Fabulous,5,Big Fat Vegan Radio is both informative and entertaining. Every episode has been a joy.
2249,Not Your Mother's Menopause with Dr. Fiona Lovely,Thank you,5,Thank you for your time and content! It‚Äôs helpful! Truly a lovely contribution to your fellow beings! Thanks again.
2250,Not Your Mother's Menopause with Dr. Fiona Lovely,Not medically accurate,1,"A gynecologist‚Äôs opinion.
It is clear that Dr. Lovely is a dedicated and caring clinician and I appreciate her devotion to informing women. But her information mixes facts and hunches in a way that can be very confusing. In the first episode she states that she believes that birth control pills caused her Pap smear to show precancerous cells that went away when she stopped the pills. We know that cervical cancer is caused by the HPV virus and now we have a more accurate test than just the Pap. Stopping the birth control pill won‚Äôt stop precancerous changes and might lead to pregnancy. I agree that women should make their own choices but based on known science. Endocrinology is very different from chiropractic care."

Anyone suffering from a chronic condition can learn and benefit from the thorough, fun, and inspiring interviews. Cory and Ian (hope I spelled their names right) are so charming, and you can tell in their voices how much they enjoy exploring different peoples‚Äô lives and journeys with cannabis as medicine. A must have for anyone using this plant to heal in any form or method."
2272,Cannabis Health Radio,Love this Station,5,My mom has stage 4 breast cancer (spread to bones and other areas) for about 3 years now. She has recently began taking the oil via suppository and has felt such pain relief and energy. She opted out of conventional. While my mom has alot of work to do I truly believe that Cannabis Oil is a blessing and will eventually cure her. Praying for everyone going through this horrible disease!

2283,Cannabis Health Radio,Great stories and information,5,Thank you!
2284,Madness Radio,The truth-beyond the absurdity of the system,5,"Will Hall and Madness Radio allowed me to survive the narrow minded messages of graduate clinical mental health studies. This should be required listening for any mental health training program. Will is an awesome advocate for choice, wellness, and accepting who we are in infinite variety. If you want help to bust out of your box this is the show for you. I was bummed to run out of new episodes having listened to every one on iTunes back to March 2006. Phew, there is another whole year of episodes available on the Madness Radio website."
2285,Madness Radio,Critical 'Alternative' Perspective,5,"Will Hall's podcast gives voice to those whose voices have been supressed by mainstream psychiatry. Hours of first-hand accounts from psychiatric survivors on how they successfully went off psychiatric meds, learned to turn their voices into assets instead of crippling burdens, and how they found community in friendship on their journeys to leading happy, meaningful lives. A must-listen!"
2286,Madness Radio,a critical eye on the ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù label,5,"we live in an insane society, and labelling people as ‚Äúinsane‚Äù rather than the culture is a convenient scapegoat. this show looks beyond the stigma and examines a lot of the issues surrounding ‚Äúmadness"""
2287,Madness Radio,Awesome podcast,5,"Will Hall's soothing, wise voice is always a treat. He chooses such smart, accomplished guests and has such a great way of breaking down complex issues. Check this show out if you're interested in alternative approaches to mental health."
2288,Madness Radio,Such an Important source of Information,5,"For us clinicians working in the mental health system, hope is extremley important. We very quickly learn the system relies mostly on psychiatric medication and we are extremley frustrated when it seems our clients are not always benefited from it, Especially with those horrible side effects. This Program has the ability to broaden our view. To see there are solutions outside the realm of medication or in conjuction with medication. We learn that our clients are best to judge what are his or hers best medications (referring to personal medication, using the words of the great Pat Deegan). We listen from many role models interviews in this show. Thanks Will & Leah. We owe you one"
2289,Madness Radio,This podcast changed my life,5,"Past, present and probably future. Thanks, Will Hall, for making it available to those of us who live out of radio frequencies, to download and listen. What a legacy..."
2290,Madness Radio,words of sanity,5,"I can't believe this podcast hasn't taken off. Everyone knows someone who is dealing with mental health issues, and yet we struggle to know how to talk about these things.
I have found the different voices and perspectives here so interesting.. but more than anything I am finding new ways to talk about these topics. Too many of the words we used are heavy with additional meanings. Here I find stories and viewpoints that give me hope and make me smile hearing the courage of speaking one's truth openly and honestly. I have learned so much about others and myself."
2291,Madness Radio,New episodes?,3,I thought there would be new content bc of your kick starter campaign... Waiting....
2292,Madness Radio,Great Show,5,"Finally, someone who knows how to interview a guest. Most interviewers are just waiting for the opportunity to talk about themselves ‚Äì but Will Hall actually listens to the guests and does a great job of paraphrasing significant points. Topics are interesting and I always learn something I can pass along to my clients."
2293,Madness Radio,Must-Listen,5,"Truth-saying by psychiatric survivors and thoughtful researchers; what is really going on with people experiencing spiritual distress, unusual states of consciousness, or simple pain as a result of the madness of modern society. Gently led by interviewer Will Hall."
2294,Madness Radio,Madness Radio delivers dose of sanity,5,"Finally a radio show that delivers some truth in a mental health world dominated by pharmaceutical company deception and corruption. Week after week Madness Radio delivers thoughtful, compassionate dialogue from the real experts from around the world."
2295,Madness Radio,Thank you,5,"As a person with a ""psychiatric label"" and a history of sometimes intense alienation,this show has provided me with support and a much needed sense of kinship that's literally made my life much more livable at times.Will Hall is fantastic and the guests are always interesting.I have immense gratitude for everyone that makes this show possible.Thank-you from the bottom of my heart."
2296,Madness Radio,will hall will inform your world,5,"The interviews on this show are always interesting, if not earth shattering. Insightful criticism of the prevailing medicalization of mental states is what this show specializes in, but it's not some kind of all-or-nothing anarcho soapbox. Hall makes sure to give you the multi-faceted view of the story, but always keeps in mind that we're all pretty familiar with what Wyeth, SmithKlien, and Pfizer have to say about mental ""illness""."
2297,Madness Radio,"If you work with people in need, you must learn more about the nuance of the need. Please listen.",5,"A superb podcast. This is one of the best kept secrets out there. I find the epsiodes very informative. This serves as the ""rounding out"" of my mental health counseling training. A professional, thoughtful production."
2298,Madness Radio,Worth the time,5,"A very thought provoking show. It may just change how you view the world and the ""mad"" people who live in it."
2299,Madness Radio,Obsessive compulsive listening,5,"Will Hall interviews an eclectic array of psychiatric survivors, activists, patients and clinicians about the
insults and injustices of the ""mental health"" system, and gives advice, tips, suggestions and anecdotes
for those who have been through it and come out the other side."
2300,Madness Radio,The Best Thing I've Heard in a long time,5,Will Hall is incredible. He finds topics and subjects to interview that are thought provoking in the extreme. His interview style does not shy away from very difficult questions as he adds insight to dialogues those in the mental health field would be well advised to listen to and those of us who experience extreme states of consciousness can relate to with relief. I am impressed and delighted with every download.
2301,Madness Radio,excellent on mental health,5,This is a great podcast. Wonderful dialogue about very challenging issues in mental health treatment and perception. Professionally done.
2302,Madness Radio,A much needed alternative view of the mental health system,5,"I am so grateful for Madness Radio! Will Hall is amazing and quite brave to stand up to the stigma of mental health in such a selfless way.
A large variety of topics are covered, with the emphasis on alternative views of mental illness beyond the biomedical perspective.
It's healed my heart and mind - keep them coming! Thanks to all who work on the program - especially Will!!"
2303,Madness Radio,I learn more each listen!,5,"This is absolutely one of the best podcasts around. I can listen to the same shows over again and learn more each time. Some are with survivors of mental illness/the psychiatric system, and others are with compassionate experts. I recommend this show to those with a history of mental illness as well as those with loved ones with psychiatric diagnoses. Madness Radio provides much needed reassurance that there is more out there than a life of hospitalizations and psychiatric drugging."
2304,Madness Radio,Excellent.,5,One of the best.Great interviews and informative.The host has a very soothing presence.Well done.
2305,Madness Radio,Challenging mainstream ideas,5,This program is one of my favorites. It challenges the myths and the accepted ideas surrounding mental illness in a very lucid way. Hope comes with alternate stories. I can't recommend it enough. It's scholarly but accessible to the average thinker.
2306,One Radio Network,Sofia Smallstrom,5,Refreshing to hear her perspective. Nothing short of the truth. Please have her back.

(I'm constantly posting it to Facebook to share with my friends!) I write about health and food politics and his interviews with the likes of Mark Bittman, Michael Pollan, Michael Moss, Sandor Katz, Mary Roach, and many others who are perhaps less well known (but no less interesting) keep me on top of these issues. I typically come away with a few tips on how to improve my own health, or the health of my loved ones, too."

2329,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Inspirational!,5,"Before this podcast I wasn‚Äôt very sure of what a doula did, but now I am inspired as I realize that this is what I have been dreaming of doing all this time! I love the earlier podcasts where you and Sarah would discuss issues Doula‚Äôs face and the business side of it, and I also love the stories. This podcast has inspired me to look at different certification programs to become certified!"
2330,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Wonderful!,5,"This podcast is amazing! So helpful, knowledgeable, and well rounded. I can listen for hours. Thank you for all you do! Can‚Äôt wait for y‚Äôall to come back with more ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2331,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Wonderful Podcast!!,5,I am a doula in training and have appreciated this podcast more than words can explain! I wish I had found it earlier before choosing my certification body because I would have chose toLabor without a doubt! Thank you for all of your hard work!
2332,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,So Lucky to Have Found You!,5,"I was literally called to be a doula - by family and friends! I kept saying I'd love to, but it was always with a disclaimer: ""I have no idea what I'm doing."" My youngest is weaned now to a point where I can be gone for a few days and she doesn't ask for me while I'm gone, so this has been my year to focus on training and my first few ""official"" clients. This podcast has been such a blessing!! I listen to and from every client interview, every pre- and post-natal visit, every doula meet and mingle, and every birth! I feel as though Th√©r√®se, Melanie and Sarah are three more exceptional doulas that I can trust to help guide my journey. They are the perfect addition to my mentoring women's circle. I love, love, LOVE this podcast - and now that I actually have paying clients, I can actually click DONATE! :)"
2333,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Phenomenal podcast!,5,"This podcast is phenomenal. So much wisdom, interesting information and anecdotes from from experienced birth workers. This podcast should be listened to by ALL; Ther√©se shares insight that can be used by anyone in life: how to be compassionate, an empathetic listener, how birth touches and shapes all of us. I've learned so much from this podcast- five stars all the way!"
2334,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Perfect for me!,5,This podcast is incredible! I love all the topics covered... so inspiring for the work that we do. Gives me a lot to think about. My favorite podcasts so far were the ones on how to talk to clients about their care provider choices and the one on doula self care. Keep this up!! It's how I get through my workouts.
2335,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Helpful & informative ‚Äî A real Joy!,5,"I am happy to write a review here to say that this podcast holds great value to me! I find it informative, professional, real, and inspiring. It is especially helpful to me as a new doula as I am getting my ducks in a row to begin taking clients, and I feel better prepared listening to all sorts of topics again 6 months after taking my certification training with a different organization ‚Äî I even take notes directly from the podcast sometimes to catalog strategies and new insights. The case studies have been very helpful in bringing up a hypothetical space for me to imagine what strategies or options I would offer had I been the doula in that situation. Case studies have pushed me to think in different ways as I imagine being put on the spot like those doulas were. This is a new & unique kind of preparation tool for me.
Feedback discussion: I quickly skimmed other reviews and saw that a few people mentioned frustrations with Therese interrupting guest speakers ‚Äî I just have to say that I have not noticed that myself, or haven‚Äôt found it bothersome/ distracting enough to notice. I've perceived Therese to be very respectful most of the time.. With limited time to turn a cut&dry interview into a thought-provoking dialogue, it sounds like Therese finds value in delving into discussions and building off of what guests are saying. We must remember she carries so much wisdom as an ‚Äúelder‚Äù in the birth community, and although the interrupting may be distracting or offensive to others, I know that I personally benefit from her commentaries as she bounces off of guests‚Äô experiences. I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ it seems to be done in a respectful way for the sake of highlighting the guests‚Äô perspective. That‚Äôs how discussions are created in a 3-person podcast episode of 60 minutes.. everyone‚Äôs trying to get a word in edgewise.
The only thing that has actually bothered me about this podcast is the frequency at which Sarah interrupts Therese, and although I realize Sarah is working hard to keep the flow of the podcast on track w/ time limits, I find it distracting when she rudely cuts off Therese mid-insight, right in the middle of a word (not just between thoughts). At times I‚Äôve felt robbed of hearing the end of Therese‚Äôs sentences, especially because she puts so much care and thoughtfulness into her choice of words. As a disclaimer, I have only listened to the first 30 episodes, so maybe this has already improved by now, but I would love to hear Sarah give Therese the chance to finish more of her sentences and honor her *full* thoughts before jumping to the next point on Sarah‚Äôs agenda (which seems more important to her). That being said, Sarah is very wonderful and thoughtful as well, and I so appreciate her fierce inquisitiveness and devotion to dissecting each moment of birthwork from the doula‚Äôs perspective. I really value when she slows down the momentum of the subject and gets into the nitty gritty of micro-desicions a doula has to make. For an experienced doula, she does a great job putting herself in the new doula‚Äôs shoes for the sake of the podcast education. All around, I want to stress that I do not feel very critical of this podcast or the way it is handled, I just want to give honest feedback. I love that the podcast fluxes organically and that topics are sometimes fluid, yet professionalism is maintained.
One thousand thank yous! You have my respect and utmost gratitude. I am considering a 2nd training with ToLabor even though I loved my 1st training with other organization!"

2341,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Doula,5,What an amazing resource for birth workers and anyone interested in birth. I learn so much from this podcast and it helps me to be a better doula. Thank you!
2342,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Such an important gift to doulas!,5,"I trained with toLabor in 2012 and was excited and grateful when these podcasts became available on ITunes. Therese is a powerful source of wisdom and experience and her co-hosts, Sarah and Melanie, have been thoughtful and engaged, their own deeply felt understanding informing the conversation. I hope this podcast keeps on going for a long time. I often do repeat listenings on topics that most matter to me. Five plus stars!"
2343,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Great Resource!,5,I love listening to this podcast and anxiously await the arrival of each new episode. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your philosphy and knowledge. I am a practicing doula and feel like this is continuing education for me on my journey.

2344,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Amazing Podcast!,5,I love this podcast! So much useful information! Listening to it really makes me want to take a workshop with Therese! Thanks toLabor for doing this!
2345,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,I‚Äôve learned so much!,5,"I have listened to all of the toRaise Questions episodes, and I can say that I‚Äôve learned more practical skills from listening to Therese, Sarah and Melanie than I have from any of the books I‚Äôve read and trainings I attended before training with toLabor as a birth doula. I love the topics, the tips, the interviews, etc. Keep them coming!"
2346,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Fantastic,5,I'm a new doula and this podcast as been essential for my learning process. It's such an amazing free resource for anyone who works in this area. I'm hoping to save up for one of their in-person workshops!
2347,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,I can‚Äôt stop listening!,5,I‚Äôm serious. I cannot stop listening to these podcasts! I feel like I am getting continuing education hours and new tranings from tuning in to these. Therese and Melanie are fabulous together and balance each other very well. I am so appreciative of them for putting this together. There need to be more doula resources like this.
2348,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Started listening a few days ago and can't get enough,5,The best podcast I've found so far on Doulas. I really enjoy the different types of episodes and the wealth of information! I've just started researching becoming a Doula and I can't thank the hosts enough for putting out this show.
2349,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,toLearn,5,I have learned so much from this podcast. It really helps you look at situations from different prospectives. I always listen to this podcast as I am gearing up for a birth. Keep it up ladies :) I will keep sharing this podcast with my doula buddies.
2350,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Insightful,5,"My doula endeavor has taken a backseat as I've started midwifery school, however I really enjoy listening to these on my commute to/from school! It is a great way to bring me back to the emotional aspect after learning the technical things in school all day. Thank you Therese, Melanie, and Sarah for taking the time to provide such a wonderful resource for new/aspiring birth workers."
2351,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,I find myself listening and re-listening,5,"There is such sound advice offered to so many sticky situations that as someone not new to birth, but new to the role of doula I find myself referencing these podcasts when a new situation arises!!
I would love for them to do an episode about how to balance when the doula has other skills-like labor nurse, birth assistant, chiropractor, (just to name a few) and how that can change the relationship with the client."
2352,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,I feel like you come over for dinner,5,"Hi ladies! I just want to say thank you so much for hosting this podcast. toRaise Questions is the fist podcast I have ever listened to. I have since searched for other birth and doula podcasts, but they just don't compare. I'm on round two, as there are no more episodes in my 'unplayed' folder.
I listen mainly while I work in the kitchen. My fianc√© travels for work, and my two year old plays while I cook and clean, so I let you ladies fill the silence.
I am in the early stages of my doula training, and I would love to attend a workshop of yours in the future. (I live in Vermont and am keeping my eye on the Middlebury workshop in May, I believe)
I have attended one birth, though I have been around natural childbirth my whole life. The birth I attended was in the hospital, and I felt totally unprepared coming from a natural birth background. Luckily my 'client' was my sister in law, so I felt comfortable enough. I don't know if enough listeners would benefit on an episode in preparation for the hospital experience, with procedures and what not, but I sure would. Or maybe one on the difference of procedure when comparing home birth to hospital?
Therese, Melanie and Sarah are my birthing heroes! If you are a childbirth professional, or aspiring to become one, have a listen.
Maybe I should have composed an email. But I just love you ladies. Thank you for all that you do.
*Sarah*"
2353,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Such a great way to continue doula education!,5,"I attended a training workshop with ToLabor, where I heard about this podcast. I am so grateful that I can continue to learn even after the training! I highly recommend this to both seasoned doulas and doulas who are just starting out. I learn so much each time I listen. Please keep this podcast coming! I just love it."
2354,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Love this!,5,I am a childbirth educator and I am learning so much that is helping me get in the birth frame of mind
2355,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,"Good resource for moms, too.",5,"Love tuning in- I'm just a mom-to-be, not a doula, and have learned a lot about what to expect during my pregnancy/ birthing day/post-natal. Therese takes over when others try to speak in every conversation, and that's a bit hard to listen to over and over."
2356,toRaise Questions Doula Podcast,Thank You for Sharing!,5,Thank you for providing such an informative and wonderful place for other doulas to come & hear your experiences. I love listening to everyone's stories & I definteily take away something from every podcast!

Thank you for encouraging folks to think in all matters of life not just health and to always ask 'What does God think most of all above anything else in our daily walk with Jesus Christ according to His wisdom and not by our own understandings.' üòÄ"
2362,Know The Cause Podcast,Ketogenic Way of Life,3,"Hi I did enjoy the podcast addressing the Ketogenic way of eating. However, I am in disagreement on a lot of points. First of all, it's not a diet. It's a way of life. There are people who have been in ketosis and who have been following this way of eating for years. They have lost weight, they no longer have T2 Diabetes, their cholesterol numbers and triglyceride numbers are amazing and some have been the recipient of some pretty significant health turn-arounds. They have more energy and are generally healthier all around. I'm not talking just a few people but hundreds and probably thousands.
Second, no one sits around eating cream cheese all day. This way of eating is filled with very healthy proteins and fats.
This kind of misinformation is very irrisponsible and misleading.
As for myself, I've been following this way of eating for about a year. I was just told yesterday that my fatty liver disease is gone. My triglycerides are fantastac and my cholesterol is better than it has been in my entire life. I had gastric bypass surgery in 2014 and I wish I had found the ketogneic way of eating before then. I am thankful that I found it and am following it now. I will be eating this way for the rest of my life.
There is scientific proof that tumors are fuelded by glucose. Yes, too much protein can turn to glucose in the system which is why the ketogenic way of eating is high fat, moderate protein and low carbohydrate. While it takes some time to undersstand the workings, it's well worth it in the long run.
There were other points in which your information was a bit skewed. I could go on but I think I'm finished.
The podcast was entertaining but also very sad that the information you gave to a very needy public just isn't correct."

2378,Beyond Your Wildest Genes,Exactly What I Needed to Hear!,5,Thank you for having Jessica Barton on your show who inspired me to gift myself 1 week of gettting up earlier to empower my inner being by meditating for 15 mins a day. I love the reference she made to Kundalini meditation about how it is a very powerful marriage of breath work and meditating. It was great hearing how Jessica appreciates simplicity with her challenges given to herself and how she makes them like a game. I am now more driven to set a meditation challenge for myself for simply 1 week that includes meditating for 15 mins and writing in my gratitude journal. Thank you for sharing your magic that inspired me to bring more magic into my life! InterviewvaletCF

2396,Optimize Paleo by Paleovalley,Wonderful health podcast!!,5,"I discovered Paleo Valley when I heard an interview of Chas Smith on Jimmy Moore's ""Livin La Vida Low Carb"" podcast. So I tried Chas's podcast and immediately appreciated the amount of really good information provided, the quality of the guests, and the very good questions posed by Chas and his wife, Autumn. They are truly serious about health and nutrition, and also maintain a sense of humor.
A few years ago, I decided to try a low carb - moderate protein - high good fat diet (akin to Paleo - Keto - Candida diets) to eradicate a yeast or candida condition that I had for a long time and it really worked, finally! (Not to mention that I lost weight naturally, without even trying - about 14 lbs) I'm very very interested in learning how to take care of my health and, at age 64, feel like I am re-learning everything that I was taught about health for most of my life. Crazy, huh? But I'm excited to learn about all the possible health benefits of this type of eating and lifestyle.
There is so much useful information in these podcasts, even from the topics I'm less interested in. I often replay the podcasts a few times over to really absorb the key points.
All I can say is a big thank you for the work and time that Chas and Autumn put into these interviews - you are really helping many of us! Please keep it up and all the best as continue to grow and reach more listeners!"

2409,Optimize Paleo by Paleovalley,"Love it, but audio issues!",3,"On the January 23 episode Isa stays consistent throughout, but it sounds like Autumn keeps moving away from the mic so you are constantly turning the volume way up to hear her and then quickly back down when she moves back to the mic or when Isa starts to speak.

2416,Fit 2 Love Podcast Show with JJ Flizanes (Audio only),My Cat Decided I Should Listen to JJ (Episode 126),5,"True Story. I was in the shower listening to a different podcast when my cat, Miko, touched my phone and switched to JJ's Fit 2 Love podcast Episode 126, ""How to Get Out of Your Own Way."" Once I heard the title, I looked at Miko and said, ""So you think I need this instead, huh?"" I swear she nodded. So, I listened. I was immediately hooked with the concept of ""the only way to block the light is to do something physical to make it go away"" as a metaphor for the wellbeing we have at our disposal. Instead, we focus on the physical and ignore or lose touch with the spiritual piece of us. We must move beyond resistance and ALLOW ourselves to feel and see the higher vibrations. JJ stated that TRYING blocks allowing. Trying carries resistance and negative emotions. Finding EASE in moving from resistance to allowing makes the journey smoother. Success comes when you change your feelings, your beliefs, and what you focus on. I loved the metaphor of turning down the bad feelings like a radio dial and only focusing on the good things.Contrast is what helps us determine what works and what doesn't work for us. In a short 30 minutes, I was able to clearly see what I could change in my own belief system to move forward. Turns out Miko was right. Just don't tell her that. :)"

Dr. Mercola - get yourself to Esther Gokhale in Silicon Valley because your neck position is messing up your upper back and creating your shoulder issue that your trainer works around."

And Video is fine on iTouch, however"
2447,Mercola Natural Health Videos,Movie format not supported on iPhone,1,"What's up with that?? If zero stars had been an option, I'd give zero. Sorry."
2448,NutriMedical Report,Been listening for years and enjoy,4,It's interesting how he's gone out of his way to scour the web to remove any ability to review his website or products. Here and google maps are the only two places you can leave reviews. His products are excellent but they're sooo expensive. I've gone out of my way to go to the vendor's website to purchase some products that are a bit steep in price. If there is a vendor website. Company has excellent customer service. I've only had issues with the shipping companies. Prices seem to be creeping up more than normal lately. Prices have basically doubled in 10 years. I use to have 20+ nutrimeds on my shelf now I only have 3-5 at most due to inflation. A lot of my health issues have been sent into remission. Knowledgable and reputable. Due to him being flooded in heavy orders and inquieries it takes several weeeks to get a reply. He wrote a protocall book a few years ago and I use that to base most of my protocalls. I treid the website but it's a bit glitchy. I'd happily pay for a subscription to have access but the link is not working.
2449,NutriMedical Report,Most informative show there is!,5,We‚Äôve been listening to Dr. Deagle for over 9 years. I am so happy there is now an iTunes podcast app.!

I listened to two episodes, they have a lot of opinions. What about facts..... just another propaganda radio show."

2454,NutriMedical Report,Medical and political commentary,5,Outside the box thinking on a wide variety of topics. *****
2455,Sweet Stella's Guided Meditations,Amazing app,5,"I love this app, it has changed my life. Her voice is so calming and the topics are spot on. Keep up the good work!!"
2456,Sweet Stella's Guided Meditations,Not just for pregnant mamas,5,"I found this podcast because of the great birth affirmations from Shannon (whose voice is very calming). But she also has other meditations that are applicable to everyone in various stages of life. I particularly like the chakra meditation, positive energy, and anger release. Thank you Shannon!"
2457,Sarah B. Yoga,One-size-fits-all!,5,"I was a student of Sarah's in Cambridge, MA and I loved her classes! Sarah's classes were always a bit slower than some of the other classes I would take, but were always the most challenging, and taught me a lot about my body and my relationship to my practice. What I found most helpful about Sarah's classes is that, despite practicing in more 'intense' classes -- power yoga, baptiste, etc. Sarah's classes always left me feeling that I had addressed some important detail, a muscle which had been ignored, a joint which had been out of whack... which allowed me to go back to more flowing, faster paced courses stronger, with a better understanding of my body, better alignment, and better attention to detaill. Since moving away from Cambridge, I have been using Sarah's podcasts to maintain my yoga practice from abroad. I set my mat up in my room, turn off my phone, dim the lights, and I'm back in the studio in Cambridge! I can't recommend this podcast enough. Moreover, the variety of styles, practice times, etc make it really a one-size fits all yoga practice!"
2458,Sarah B. Yoga,Love Episode 50 Yoga Nidra,5,I listen to Sarah's yoga nidra on a regular basis at bedtime. She does a beautiful job. I listened to episode 54 but I prefer episode 50. Thank you so much!
2459,Sarah B. Yoga,So Thankful,5,"Sarah is absolutely amazing! She has not only changed my yoga practice for the better, but also my life. I can‚Äôt thank her enough. I have had the privilege of attending Sarah‚Äôs classes as well as taking private lessons with her - I highly recommend both. Before working with Sarah, I truly disliked downward dog. Because of Sarah‚Äôs work with me, my relationship with downward dog has been transformed and it feels so much better in my body, something I never thought possible. Not only has she helped me to transform physically, but also mentally and spiritually. I can‚Äôt recommend Sarah and her services enough ‚Äì it has been an honor to be a student of hers."
2460,Sarah B. Yoga,"Real, simple, beautiful.",5,"Sarah's yoga is for any and everybody. I have been able to build a home practice around her classes- these podcasts. Her cueing is so effective, and easy to follow; she is able to describe motion, direction, and take you through visualizations of postures that allow for unexpected growth and depth. She makes yoga relatable and approachable. I have deepened and developed my practice with Sarah. These classes have been a blessing for me, and I strongly encourage you to try!"
2461,Sarah B. Yoga,"Thanks, Sarah!",5,"I‚Äôm writing this after having done only one podcast; I‚Äôve never met or even heard of Sarah before. And I am subscribing and downloading most of her previous ones ‚Äî this is powerful yoga. The one I did was slow and strong, really an hour well spent."
2462,Sarah B. Yoga,"No ranting, pure yoga",5,"I like how this podcast starts immediately. I don't really care for yoga teachers talking too much in the beginning. Sharing is okay but some people overdo it. If you want to have quiet, serious, meditative practice at home, try this podcast. I hope new episodes keep coming."
2463,Sarah B. Yoga,Remote Learning Opportunity?,4,"Perhaps you're like me. I've never met Sara. I've never been to one of her classes. I live in a rural area and at times the closest real, live yoga instructor is 90 miles away.
Doing yoga while listening to a podcast is like canoeing a river blindfolded. Sara B as your guide shows you how to navigate that river successfully. Her recent releases incorporate the imagery necessary when you're at the disadvantage of not seeing someone model the pose. So many of the yoga podcasts available are simply a recording of a live class. It is incredible and rare to find person so mindful to include cues and descriptions for those following along after the fact. Thank you, Sara B, from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan."
2464,Sarah B. Yoga,Wonderful,5,"Sarah is a wonderful teacher, precise as an OM yoga teacher always is. As an OM teacher myself it is fantastic to find Sarah's pod casts so I can have a directed practice at home. You will learn a great deal from Sarah. thanks Sarah"
2465,Sarah B. Yoga,Best yoga practice podcast,5,"I've tried most of the other practice podcasts out there and this is by and far the best. The instructor does an excellent job with directions, intentions, and mantras.
The soft music in the background is just enough. Not too loud and not obnoxious."
2466,Sarah B. Yoga,i love the sarah b podcast!,5,"I took a few classes with Sarah while I was living in Cambridge and really enjoyed her classes. Her pacing is well considered and she has a nice range - i really grew in my practice through classes with her and others at Karma. When i moved out of the country, i was thrilled to find that I could take Sarah with me in the form of the posdcast!! Sarah is also incredibly responsive to contact - i was having trouble with the site and emailed her and her reply was quick and she was warm and engaging - even over the world wide web!"
2467,Sarah B. Yoga,Sarah is amazing!,5,"Sarah is an incredible yoga teacher and an inspiring source of humor, creativity, compassion, honesty, introspection, and proper alignment. Her classes are challenging for the body, grounding for the mind, and incredibly instructive towards improving your practice and your alignment. Sarah creates incredibly creative and fun flow sequences. Sarah is a dancer as well as a yogi and so I think her dance experience helps her choreograph the flow in totally cool ways. Often in a class, I will be doing a flow of familiar poses in a new and interesting sequence. Her style is creative and at the same time grounded in yogic tradition. She is truly a beautiful, brilliant, and inspirational yoga teacher. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically recommend class and podcasts with Sarah!"
2468,Sarah B. Yoga,The best you'll find,5,"Sarah is an incredible yoga instructor - the best you will find. Here are some reasons why: In addition to her yoga training and practice, Sarah's professional dance background gives her an extensive and intricate knowledge of body alignment and techniques of relating to the body.
She has a deep understanding of the philosophies at the heart of yoga and incorporates them into her classes. Her wholistic, mindful approach leads to benefits deeper than fitness and flexibility alone (though these of course happen, too!) Sarah's classes are focused and challenging while simultaneously lighthearted and creative. You will rarely do the exact same sequence twice in her sessions. Sarah is open-minded and mindful of the needs of her students, often describing how to adjust practice to cater to personal intentions or limitations. She is a warm, compassionate person who lives and practices what she teaches. She is a truly dedicated and inspirational instructor. SPREAD THE WORD!"
2469,Sarah B. Yoga,Thanks Sarah,5,"Sarah's live classes, and podcast classes are the best I have found. Sarah has a simple way about her instruction that really brings mind, body, and spirit together. Thanks Sarah. Keep up the good work!"
2470,Sarah B. Yoga,boston loves sarah b!,5,"I have been a student of Sarah's for over two years (in both Minneapolis and Boston), and I haven't encountered another instructor that even remotely compares to the creativity and diversity of her teaching and her attention to detail. Each class of hers is a small, wonderful little journey! I had taken many yoga classes before I met Sarah, but didn't understand the practice well, and (despite the cliche) the first class I took of hers really did change my perspective about my practice. Her classes are wonderful regardless, but I found them extremely helpful in recovering from a back injury. I highly recommend Sarah's classes to anyone needing a small frame of happiness!"
2471,Sarah B. Yoga,Try her classes and you'll be hooked,5,I started yoga in 2003 and I have been taking classes with Sarah for over 2 years now. In the 7 years I have not met another instructor so careful of what her students need. Her classes are almost like they are custom tailored for any pain you might have. The way she suggests modifications and alternatives and helps correct your allignment enables you to enjoy challenging poses without fear of injury. I have recommended her classes to 4 of my friends who are at different levels of familiarity with yoga and all 4 have become regulars for her classes (vinyasa and hatha) and podcasts.
2472,Sarah B. Yoga,"Beautiful, brilliant yoga = Sarah B",5,"Sarah is one of the most gifted yoga instructors that I've ever met. She is truly a gem! Throughout my 10 years of practicing yoga, I have never found a more compassionate, graceful, gifted, intelligent and grounded instructor.
Since moving away from Boston, I have continued my practice with Sarah through her podcasts. They are perfect for rainy days, yoga while traveling or for home! Her focus on alignment is unlike anyone you will meet. Each class is tailored to address specific ailments and Sarah always provides detailed instruction, which you can follow even if you are a beginner!
After every class, I always emerge renewed, re-aligned and feeling more like myself. Like a breath of fresh air. A must for any yogi - aspiring or advanced. And, when in Boston, Minneapolis you must make sure to take a class with her live, too!
Thank you Sarah and continue the beautiful work!!"
2473,Sarah B. Yoga,Sarah is my all time favorite yoga instructor,5,"Sarah's teaching style is thoughtful, accessible and perfectly down-to-earth. I have complete trust in her knowledge of the body. As a dancer, I've taken a lot of yoga classes over the years and she is by far and away my favorite teacher. She's gifted at creating a practice that addresses the body, mind and spirit. I use her podcasts to warm myself up for rehearsals, I take them with when I'm performing on tour and I turn them on when I just want to stay home and practice yoga in my living room. She offers a range of classes and I can always find one that fits in with my needs on any given day. I'm so thankful to have them."
2474,Sarah B. Yoga,"Inspiring, Intelligent, and Worth every second",5,"In each of these beautifully-crafted yoga classes, instructor Sarah B guides you with precision and warmth through a creative sequence of postures that leaves you feeling at home in your body and at ease in your mind.
Technically, Sarah's clear instructions, intelligent sequencing, and deep understanding of alignment make these podcasts a wonderful basis for your home practice.
Even over the internet, her wisdom and care come shining through. I feel so grateful to have these classes as part of my yoga practice and as part of my life. They are worth every second!"
2475,Sarah B. Yoga,"Calm, Cool & Challenging",5,"Sarah's pace is a bit slower than other vinyasa podcasts i currently practice with, but that's what i love about it. her classes allow me to focus on alignment, paying attention to different sensations that may come up, & i'm also able to be that much more present in each pose. this podcast has been so beneficial to my personal practice!! thank you, Sarah!"
2476,Sarah B. Yoga,As well Boston should!,5,"Boston SHOULD love Sarah Baumert, Minneapolis and St. Paul sure do! And we MISS her! Sarah is uniquely gifted in reaching every yoga student (in person AND online!) has a soothing, calming voice and manner, and puts all students at ease, while helping them strive to reach their personal potential and focus. I cannot sing her enough praise, and I'm a jazz singer! ;) I deemed Sarah ""The Yoga Whisperer"" when I first started taking classes from her in the Twin Cities, and this title will always hold true."

2514,The Gabriel Method,"Interesting info, poor execution",1,"I've listened to episode one, and I really want to hear the rest, but the interviewer interrupts Gabriel's story constantly while he's mid-sentence and her active listening (""Wow."" ""Yeah."" ""Right!"" ""Oh my!"" ""That's amazing!"" ""That's very powerful."") is incredibly disruptive to the flow of information. This podcast is almost unlistenable, especially if you value your time."
2515,The Gabriel Method,Thank you!,5,Great to hear these!
2516,The Gabriel Method,The Final Answer-FINALLY!!!,5,"Jon Gabriel's insights, vast knowledge, passion and compassion, experience and teaching are spot on. I have been listening to all of the previous podcasts, read his book and am using several of his visualizations, and find my whole point of reference for how I see myself has changed. I am forgiving myself for all the years I hated my body, when all along my body was dancing as fast as it could to protect and take care of me. I am so grateful for my body now. Thank you, Jon Gabriel for the gift you give so freely to all of us. A book and program every person who has ever struggled with their weight should read-it will change your life. 5 stars seems so inadequate to rate these podcasts and The Gabriel Method. Donna in NC."
2517,The Gabriel Method,The Only Way To Go,5,"After listening to the simple rationale of the 1st chapter of Jons audiobook I feel I have the keys to the castle. And I must becuase I have lost 20 pounds in a week, and am having LOW blood sugar.. which is bad, but welcome as this can be controlled and is a GOOD thing...
I no longer even think about the ""nasty"" foods that maks my body sick and big...
I can not wait to hear all these podcasts, and finish the book as well.. I am so happy now and feel there really is a way out of obesity.. Everyone should try this method!"
2518,The Gabriel Method,Totally facinating !,5,"I absolutely love these podcasts! I read Jon Gabriel's book, this is a whole new concept to weight loss. I have always believed there was more to it than counting calories, I have been dieting my whole life, this makes total sence to me, I will never diet again! I can't wait for these podcasts each week."
2519,The Gabriel Method,Fascinating,5,"You'd think this would get old, but it doesn't. Jon Gabriel has a few concepts that he repeats again and again, and I am fascinated every time he talks about them. He has a truth he has experienced, an evangelist's heart (in the best sense of the term), and a passion to help others benefit from what he has learned. I have been trying to adopt some of what he teaches, but even just listening to him is an encouragement. Enjoy his show!"
2520,The Gabriel Method,Dealing with the Mind when trying to lose weight,5,"Most of today's diets don't deal with the core issues of weight loss, the mind and emotions. Mentally and emotionally why are you obese. Learning why one is having trouble with food can be more powerful then the diet itself. And finding healing in your mind and emotions can trigger your body into healing itself. This is the crux of Jon's message. I purchsed the Gabriel Method and have been listening to the audio's. I look forward to listening to his blog. He lived obesity and he lost it."
2521,Real Food Radio,Wealth of Knowledge,5,"I love Ayla! The show is so educational. I‚Äôve worked with Ayla personally and she‚Äôs open, empathetic, and gentle in her approach. She‚Äôs a wealth of knowledge. Meeting with her and listening to Real Food Radio has changed my health! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

2524,The Hashimoto's Doctor,Negligent and self promoting,1,I‚Äôve listened to a few of these podcasts which honestly sound like they‚Äôre filmed in a car without any real forethought or plan. Dr. Shook claims to be an expert on Hashimoto‚Äôs but many of his podcasts fail to even mention Hashimoto‚Äôs like his episode on why you can‚Äôt lose weight with Hashimoto‚Äôs. This episode was a rambling mess about intermittent fasting and Hashimoto‚Äôs was not mentioned even once. Well I‚Äôve done that before being diagnosed with Hashimoto‚Äôs and it didn‚Äôt change anything for me because there were a whole host of other issues that needed to be addressed. These podcasts are negligent and don‚Äôt offer information Hashimoto‚Äôs patients really need and come across as elitist and like he believes he is far better and smarter than his audience. There are plenty of actual experts in this field. I‚Äôll stick their books than this self serving podcast.
2525,The Hashimoto's Doctor,"Self promoting, he is not an Endocrinologist",1,Your lack of actual context in your podcasts is concerning. You obviously do not have any formal endocrinology training which is also concerning since you promote yourself as a Hashimoto‚Äôs expert. Overall very disturbed by your self proclaimed expertise without a formal fellowship.
2526,The Hashimoto's Doctor,Good information poor recording quality,3,Really recording while driving? I can hear the turn signal
2527,The Hashimoto's Doctor,Very helpful,5,Great podcast! I‚Äôd be happy to listen to longer episodes. Only negative here is that sound quality is often poor at times.
2528,The Hashimoto's Doctor,Jo-Ann Inguanta,5,"Dr. Shook‚Äôs podcasts are such valuable resources for people who are looking to improve their health. They are detailed but short enough that I can listen as I go about my day cleaning, cooking, doing laundry, on a lunch break at work, or driving in the car. Thank you Dr. Shook for taking the time to educate the world with great information that we can trust from a reliable source. You are absolutely one of the very best Functional Medicine doctors on earth!"
2529,Life By Design Podcast,Logical and sensible,5,"I love this podcast. Their approach to healthy lifestyle changes is centered around common sense and small attainable changes. They are practical and understanding of the challenges faced by many people in today's society. There is never blame or that guilty feeling you get for missing a workout or eating the wrong food. After every episode you walk away with a true ""I can do this"" attitude! This is a top ten podcast for me each week!"
2530,Life By Design Podcast,Too much politics,2,"Some good stuff if you appreciate or if you can get past the conservatism. Not worth the effort, IMO, there are plenty of podcasts that teach similar material without forcing an ideology down your throat. Nice sound quality, obviously very prepared, the 2 is for political content only."
2531,Life By Design Podcast,Taking care of your life,5,This is a common sense approach to taking care of your life. Good health starts with Life By Design.

2535,Authentic Living,So many gifts and insights,5,"The more I listen, the more I learn and appreciate. ‚ÄòLearning to receive love‚Äô changed my life. <3"
2536,Authentic Living,Love Andrea Matthews,5,"I have been following Andrea Matthews for a while, but until recently I hadn‚Äôt realized that I did not truly understand what she has been teaching, most especially regarding the Authentic Self. I‚Äôm revisiting her work again, through her Podcasts, her Psychology Today posts (‚ÄúTraversing the Inner Terrain‚Äù), her OmTimes posts, along with reading her books. Ms. Matthews is a treasure and I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more reviews for this amazing woman who makes understanding psychology, spirituality, and more, easy, complete and enjoyable, as well. Her manner is direct and succinct, as well as compassionate and loving. I especially love that she poses things as not ULTIMATE TRUTHS but rather as PLAUSIBILITIES! My Inner Ears are finally open and I‚Äôm learning so much. Thank you, Andrea!!!"
2537,Authentic Living,LOVE this Podcast/ Author/Speaker,5,"Listening for many months. Very worth my time... Contemplative in up times, nourishing in low times. Consistent w/ my highest beliefs, yet allowing of differing views w/o offense, IMO. You Rock, Andrea, in the best senses of the word.

2562,Forbidden Doctor: Revealing Forbidden Health Secrets!,Cataplex F,2,"What do cold sores, restless leg, and heatstroke have in common? This product being recommended has gluten in it, and also isn‚Äôt plant based for someone like myself.

2565,Forbidden Doctor: Revealing Forbidden Health Secrets!,Beware!,1,"So much information in this podcast is harmful to your health. Its hard these days to know whats right or wrong when it comes to health and nutrition, so i would proceed with caution. If theres no science to back it up i dont even bother, and even more so there IS science that absolutely proves them wrong."
2566,Forbidden Doctor: Revealing Forbidden Health Secrets!,Spread the good word!,5,"Thank you Jack and Mary for all the time and life experience that you put into this vital work of helping us realize that we are the doctor that has been forbidden by simple lack of knowledge and dependent tradition. Thank you for helping to restore that knowledge and giving us a new awareness of the responsibility for our own well-being and health that we can take on.
The most powerful thing I have learned from you in the 20 years I‚Äôve known you, besides how our bodies work and ways to take care of them, is being ‚Äòloving, kind and tender‚Äô with my own heart is vital if I want to love anyone else!‚Äô And this is the most important thing I can teach my children. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2567,Forbidden Doctor: Revealing Forbidden Health Secrets!,I adore you,5,You guys are adorable and I love learning from you.

2569,Nourish + Flourish,An honest approach to holistic health,5,"Betsy and Emily humbly offer their honesty, vulnerability, and honest conversation about a kind of holistic care we should all consider.

2570,Nourish + Flourish,Good For The Soul,5,"This podcast has made its way into my regular rotation, which is saying a lot since there are so many podcasts I love and so little time.

2580,Good Night,Gem,5,"Discovered this podcast at random on Stitcher a few weeks ago. So I have a ton of back catalog to enjoy.

I'm a bit young to be in the Louie Louie generation, but man I dig this podcast."
2581,Good Night,Better than a sleeping pill,5,"What a wonderful way to go to sleep. I don't know why Mr Sommers does this pod cast, but I am very greatful. His delightful stories and little asides gets my mind away from its racing thoughts and lets me think about sweeter things until I fall gently asleep. Much better than taking an addictive antipsychotic pill to make me sleep. Thanks for the memories. Good Night!"
2582,Good Night,Love Dick Summer,5,"I fell in love with Dick during the 80s when he was a DJ in NY. I have never in my life head a voice like his, very sexy and yet relaxing. Dick is the last one I hear at night, for I go to sleep listening to him on my IPod. Thank you Dick for giving us these Podcasts. I would also recommend the great CDs you have made, I have purchased several of them and they really move me.
Thanks again Dick for sharing your talent with us,
Janette Channing"
2583,Good Night,i love dick summer,5,"i not only have a problem falling asleep, but my family likes watching scary movies, and every night when im desperately trying to squeeze in as much sleep as possible, i always replay the scariest parts of those movies, its just the way i am and theres nothing i can do. so, i was cruising around the podcast section and i saw the 5 star ratings of this podcast, and i thought, hey, i'll give it a try. and now every night before i go to bed, i listen to one of these podcasts, his voice is so relaxing sometimes i fall asleep in the middle of what he's saying. and then the next morning i'll wake up angry at myself that i didn't get to hear the whole thing! His stories and his voice are enchanting, and i wish there were more guys out there like dick summer... but anyway, everyone should listen to this podcast, i know that I feel as though my day isn't complete unless i listen to one of these FABULOUS podcasts!!!!!!!!!!!!!
p.s. i would just like to thank dick summer for creating these wonderful podcasts!!!! never stop making them!!!!!!!!"
2584,Good Night,very soothing,5,"I love Dick Summer's voice! His podcast is very soothing. Since he intends to distract you from your worries to help you fall asleep, I've tried listening when I wake in the middle of then night, but I find it too engrossing. So I put Good Night at the beginning of my 'sleep' playlist to get me started on my relaxation & my journey into sleep. Keep up the good work, Mr. Summer!"
2585,Good Night,Tranquilized,5,"A great podcast for lowering the blood pressure, I'm enjoying Good Night for a nice voice and an easy style with lots of humor about offbeat things in life."
2586,Good Night,Relaxing and Hypnotic,5,"I use my iPod for many things: work, church, and working out. After d/ling Dick Summer's podcast, I now use it to fall asleep. The stories that Dick tells help to get my mind off the day's events, and tomorrow that is only a few hours away. They're engaging without causing your mind to race...they relax you. Plain and Simple.
I think Dick Summer is probably the only artist who considers putting people to sleep a success.
Excellent Podcast!"
2587,Good Night,"Thank you, Mr. Summer.",5,"I cannot tell you how much I'm in love with Dick Summer. I'm a 22 year-old college student and I have serious sleep disorders... as do most college students. Dick Summer's podcast has now become my nightly ritual and I usually fall asleep within the first 5 minutes. he really makes you forget all the silly things you worry about before bed! Trust me, if he can put an end to the skitzo college days, he can put you to sleep! Best podcast on the ipod waves."
2588,Good Night,Very Impressive!,5,"I too am a recent graduate, and falling asleep quickly has been one of my many sleep difficulties. Dick Summer is a life saver! I can't remember the last time I've slept so great! Def. give him a shot, if you're skeptical! You can't help help but shut your mind off when you turn him on, and fall asleep soon!!!! Everyone is different I suppose, and it won't work on everybody, but hey, what do you have to lose? It's free!"
2589,Good Night,It works for me!,5,It is hard to describe this podcast. Maybe it is so effective because he used to be a clinical hypnotist. But he doesn't hypnotize. He just talks in this fantastic deep and gentle voice. He tells great stories and gently moves me to sleep. I am very greatful.
2590,Good Night,Wonderful,5,"Amazing. Either I fall asleep instantly or I'm deeply touched by an emotional story - even if I'm far from being a member of the ""luyluy generation"" (?). summers skill and background in hypnosis shows in every word he uses."

2605,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Such A Good Show,5,"Glad to see this show again, and I will subscribe!"
2606,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Enjoyed it until..,1,"Brand new listener here, and I probably shouldn't just judge the entirety of this podcast by one incident. However, I think it speaks to her character.
Began listening to episode 26 and she began discussing her interaction with a friend who purchased a puppy from a breeder. She became really subtly judgemental and when her friend got upset, her reaction was ""it's your problem if you feel bad about it"". (Not a direct quote). Idk, I completely am for situations where direct confrontation is needed, but I think this attitude Erin has just further embraces the stereotype of the high and mighty vegan. You made your friend feel bad. Are there dogs that need rescuing? Yes. Should they be considered before adopting a bred puppy, yes! But if someone doesn't go in the direction you would have, you do not need to make them feel as though they personally escorted a kennel dog to the chamber. And further, it's not wholly their responsibility if they are offended.
Other people might hear this and not think anything of it, and that's totally fine. I, however, was too put off by this attitude to continue listening to her."
2607,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,"Huh, Returning?",3,"If not, just say so instead of saying you'll be back ""soon"" on Twitter. Be honest about it. If you are doing something different now for the animals--GREAT! But it's rude to keep listeners wondering.
But whatever, it's your show to do--or don't do--as you wish."
2608,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,"Real, Raw and Compassionate: The Perfect Blend",5,Red has literally changed my life with her approach toward veganism. Thanks for providing this information to the public and I look forward to hearing more!

2619,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,It's okay,3,"People seem really into this show, but I guess I don't see what it brings to the table that isn't done by better vegan podcasts like Our Hen House. It's just fine, but no big deal. She also seems a little full of herself, but maybe that's just the way you sound when it's just you talking."
2620,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,<3,5,love your show. I learn so much ever week from you.
2621,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Fantastic!,5,"Every week Erin's podcast brings something new, exciting and accessible to listeners of all backgrounds. Erin has a fresh perspective and fun personality. On a personal note, listening to her podcast as a new vegan has helped me feel supported as a new member of the vegan community. Thanks Erin!"
2622,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Love!!!,5,"In addition to providing excellent insight & information, Erin Red puts a charming twist on all things vegan. Witty & a bit wicked at times, this girl is true inspiration. Download them ALL!"
2623,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Vegan banter with a bite,5,"A must listen for those who are considering or are already vegan. Great interviews, tons of info, super awesome."
2624,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,not inclusive,2,"As a vegan I could not recommend this podcast to potential vegans. I listened to a few and it seems judgemental, exclusive and a little angry - We don't need smug vegans."
2625,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Video Gamers Unite! Go VEGAN!!!!,5,"As a gamer (and a friend of lots of gamers) I know first hand what horrible diets we have, and it needs to stop. I've improved in every aspect of my life (including gameing!) since going Vegan."
2626,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Still Amazing,5,"I just finished listening to episode 57, and this show has just gotten better and better (seemingly impossible considering her first interview was GPG). The Dirty Birds episodes had me relating more to her than anyone I actually know. I feel like she is one of my best friends... at least once a week. I'd go crazy if I didn't have my vegan podcasts. Lovin it, always."
2627,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,I've Been Waiting A Long Time For This.,5,"I have been looking for a ""great"" vegan podcast for the past several years and I have found it with Red Radio.
Red Radio is smarty, witty, socially conscious and extremely entertaining. It's everything you could want in a podcast."
2628,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Great podcast....,5,Great rep for the vegans.
2629,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,Fun to listen to but disappointing,2,"I've enjoyed listening to many episodes over the last several months because I like Red's spunk, voice, attitude, and many of the topics are interesting to me. However, after listening to episode 57, I am extremely disappointed in Red and the guests she brought on the show. I had read the article they discuss a while ago and forgotten about it, but over the course of this podcast these women crucify someone for one choice, insulting her personally, making wild assumptions about her relationships, career, and personal life that seem to have no basis in reality, and make fools of themselves with repeated and hypocritical contradictions (""she said she was afraid of the backlash? She wasn't scared, she's weak and addicted"" umm) It sounds like veganism was central to the author's life and career; thus, when something so central changes, it makes sense to explain oneself. I understand that Red and her guests didn't approve of this woman's choice, and were apparently incensed by her (eventual) explanation, but their childish and borderline slanderous public gossip session leaves me hitting the unsubscribe button.
Overall, the podcast's not a bad listen for anyone interested in plant-based culture, food, lifestyle, and the environment, but it's not worth the negative vibes."
2630,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,LOVE IT!,5,She is so articulate and is a regular part of my news feed. I listen to each and every episode!
2631,Red Radio: Vegan Banter with a Bite,What a bite,5,"With a voice and bite like Erin Red's, what's not to like about vegan focussed Red Radio. Thanks Erin, love your vegan spunk!"

2644,Chiropractic Science,Science based validation,5,"Dr Dean Smith has a effective interview style that is easy to listen to. He presents a variety of evidenced based, relevant topics.
Thanks for keeping the profession and public updated."
2645,Chiropractic Science,Learning From The Leaders,5,Dr. Dean is putting together a collection of interviews in order to archive the leaders in chiropractic research.

2647,Chiropractic Science,Great information,5,Kudos to Dr. Smith for putting together a podcast focused on current research in chiropractic. Much of the information within the field is unfortunately antiquated. The current research discussed brings to light the modern understanding of the subluxation complex and the mechanisms therein. Excited to hear from more of the industries brightest researchers!
2648,Chiropractic Science,Scientific and philosophical excellence,5,"Being in practice for many years, I am weary of ideologically biased forums when 21st Century chiropractic can have, and bring it all; evidence and practice based science WITH a strong philosophical foundation.

2652,Chiropractic Science,Inspired me to become a researcher,5,This podcast literally inspired me to go get a PhD so I can research the brain and help out the Chiro community. I love this podcast!
2653,Chiropractic Science,Excellent chiropractic podcast,5,"This is the podcast that gives me hope and optimism for the chiropractic profession. Too many podcasts focus on vague philosophy without offering any practical advice or real world information.
Listening to the true leaders of our profession discuss their journeys and the future of chiropractic makes me excited for what's to come. I recommend this podcast to any practicing doctors, students, and even chiropractic skeptics!"
2654,Chiropractic Science,This is for every chiropractor!,5,"This is for chiropractors who want to help their patients by advancing chiropractic among other health professionals. It's time we stop seeing other health care providers as those who resist the chiropractor. If we were better at communicating, educating, and explaining chiropractic more providers would collaborate with us and more people would be healed. This podcast provides the resources to do just that."
2655,Chiropractic Science,Great podcast,5,"I absolutely love Dr. Smith's podcasts. He brings the best of the best in the chiropractic profession to share current research knowledge with his listeners. His podcasts are engaging and informative, and I always end them being more knowledgeable than when I started. Great leader for the profession"
2656,Chiropractic Science,Fantastic Resource,5,"I stumbled across this podcast as a trimester 2 chiropractic student. The first segment I listened to was with Dr. Bernadette Murphy and I was hooked. Dr. Dean Smith does an incredible job of guiding the interview fluidly and asking the very questions that come to my mind while listening. As someone who wants to be involved in research Dr. Smith ends his interviews with ""what advice would you have for someone interested in pursuing research?""
The responses from those interviewed have been nothing short of inspiring. I'd recommend this podcast to anyone interested in neuromusculoskeletal medicine ESPECIALLY manual therapists."

2658,Chiropractic Science,Fresh Ideas from Contemporary Scientific Thought Leaders in the Chiropractic Profession,5,"Dr. Smith brings you insights from contemporary researchers from around the world.

I am reminded of the references and research personalities my mentor, the late Dr. Joe Keating would report and these podcasts continue in that same spirit. Keep up the good work!"
2659,Chiropractic Science,What an outstanding resource!,5,By far one of the most valuable content sources for new and old chiropractors alike. Reliably poignant content presented in an easy to digest manor.
2660,Chiropractic Science,Chiropractic Works,5,So many Chiropractors see ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù happen in their offices but have no clue of the physiology of why they happen. This is a great podcast that can help docs confidence in what they do grow and then be able to ethically help more people.

I just love hearing their voices and know that the information I am getting is real, honest and funny. Keep up the great work you guys!"
2667,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Sexy Stoners Smell,5,"Listen to MADAS if you don‚Äôt want to be a stupid stoner. They will educate you on anything from how to grow your own cannabis to the history of prohibition. Cannabis prohibition. Thanks for all the laughs, education to help normalize cannabis in life. üôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è"
2668,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Great podcast,5,"Love listening to the podcast. Was wondering if you ever get a bad taste in your mouth from a bong or bowl even after you cleaned it? It‚Äôs really hard for me to smoke papers and my pipes and bongs all taste terrible! It‚Äôs deff not the weed!
Also can you talk about the best types of flower that get you the highest?"
2669,Mom and Dad are Stoned,New subscriber.,5,"As a single dad out there, I love this show. It's entertaining and informative."
2670,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Thanks a bunch!,5,"I listen to you all day at work while I make pediatric heart catheters, and dream about when I can go home and smoke. I then come home and do the family thang. My hunny and I sit back and relax when the 3 monsters go to bed and toke up while we listen to your podcast! Love you guys! And keep up the great content!!"
2671,Mom and Dad are Stoned,My #1 Podcast,5,I discovered MADAS and Stoner Mom about 8 months ago when I first started medicating with cannabis. They helped so much with all the questions and feelings and awkwardness that come up as a new Stoner. It‚Äôs my #1 podcast to listen to when I walk my dog. They are super relatable and feel like friends from the neighborhood.
2672,Mom and Dad are Stoned,"Fun, Informative Podcast!",5,"I love listening to MADAS on my long morning commute! I always learn something new listening to them and enjoy the banter between Katherine and Blavid. As a stoner mom myself, it‚Äôs nice to feel like I have a connection to other responsible stoners; I feel like I‚Äôm a part of this stoner family in a way. Thanks for the great content! I always look forward to listening to another podcast from you guys every morning."
2673,Mom and Dad are Stoned,So Relatable!,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to MADAS for over one year and look forward to each new episode. Kathryn and David are real, unpretentious and informative. Medicating with cannabis in a heavily stigmatized world can feel lonely at times. Kathryn and David help me to realize that I‚Äôm not alone in this and always put a smile in my face!"
2674,Mom and Dad are Stoned,I love it,5,Its a great podcast to listen too at work! So heres my story. I am having a child being born on February 11 of 2019. My girlfriend is 22 im 21 we live on the beautiful Oregon coast. Im originally a Colorado native (born in boulder). But we have been smoking since we met. She loves dabs I prefer flowers. Well i hope all is well!
2675,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Legit lifesaver,5,"I relate to Kathryn on so many levels and the love between she and Blavid is obvious. (My husband‚Äôs name is also David üòâ) The Stoner Mom reviews are also my favorite reference when trying out something new. Her reviews are spot on and super honest. MADAS invites the listener into the lives of its hosts and lets you feel like you‚Äôre just hanging with some friends rather than strangers in a totally different part of the country.
I started listening maybe a year ago, but since I‚Äôm a SAHM with a toddler I can only listen during kid free time so I‚Äôm still working my way through the earlier stuff between new episodes. I live in a nonlegal state so I cannot be open about my daily cannabis use. I use cannabis to treat constant nausea, depression, anxiety, ptsd, and to sleep. This podcast and the stoner mom have gotten me through some pretty tough spots. When I‚Äôm low it‚Äôs really hard to medicate even when I know it will help. Listening to MADAS reminds me how important it is to medicate and stay present for my son. They remind me that there are things in the world that are funny and sweet and worth it. I‚Äôve learned SO much from this podcast, from which strains are better for certain things to ideas on how to store my stash more responsibly to tips on medicating discretely.
10/10 would recommend üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
2676,Mom and Dad are Stoned,OMG. I finally reviewed.,5,"So, even though I don't use I tunes one bit. I <3 this pod so much I wanted to give some shiny stars to my Cannabis Mentors. Thanks. And so you know this was extra effort."
2677,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Amazeballs!,5,Love this podcast! I enjoy finding out what‚Äôs going on in Dave‚Äôs grow every week! You guys seem to have an amazing relationship with each other and it definitely translates on this podcast. Keep up the good work!
2678,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Love it!,5,I wanted to update my review to say that I love every single thing y‚Äôall do! I work from my car and I almost always have y‚Äôall on while I drive. Keep up the amazing work Blavid and Kathryn!
2679,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Love love love your show!,5,"As a mom of 6, who lives in a not legal state, it is wonderful to listen to you all. Your show is funny and sweet, plus I learn so much!!! I have used CBD for anxiety for awhile now and in March started using cannabis as a way to help with my stress. Thanks to you both I feel no guilt for it, and I have a wonderful Pax 3 because of your reviews!!You have made me want to be a better advocate for legalization in my state, and I want to work to help the laws pass here in Indiana. I also am now planning a trip to Colorado to enjoy all it has to offer!! My favorite thing is you have taken away the shame moms feel for medicating! Thank you!!!"

2684,Mom and Dad are Stoned,SAHM trying to cope,5,"Honestly I‚Äôm way to stoned to be writing this right now. I am a stay at home mom of an almost 2yr old boy. Since giving birth I have been struggling with anxiety and depression. To this day I am still trying to figure out medication and ‚Äúget back to normal‚Äù. I listen to y‚Äôalls (yes I‚Äôm from Oklahoma) podcast while folding laundry, cleaning house, cooking dinner, etc. It‚Äôs like having the company of friends when you don‚Äôt even want to be around yourself. I still have bad days but listening to you talk about your experiences & that it‚Äôs okay to medicate with cannabis helps ease my mind that I‚Äôm not being a bad mom by smoking bud. We just got medical legalized here last month!!! Yea! I figured Oklahoma would be the last to legalize. Please send good vibes that I will be able to obtain a medical card! BTW I LOVE your videos!

As a returning Veteran and sliding into the medical cannabis world as an alternative to BigPharma these two have not only reinforced my decision but also shed a different perspective on the subject for my beautiful patient kind straight edge (except vodka drinks here and there) never done anything except have a drink now and then. Keep doing good things. We need more people similar to this.
2689,Mom and Dad are Stoned,Love this podcast!,5,"Katherine and David and hilarious and super informative. I‚Äôve been listening to you guys for about 6 months now and have all my friends listening too! (Don‚Äôt get too excited, I only have 2 friends) lol. I appreciate all that you share and now I don‚Äôt have to smoke alone. So thanks for normalizing smoking and making me feel better about medicating as a mom. You guys rock, continue doing what you‚Äôre doing üòä"
2690,Mom and Dad are Stoned,On FIRE!!,5,"Kathryn and David are all-around good people. I appreciate what they are trying to do to break the stigma of stoner parents. I started listening when I was pregnant with my second child, to learn more about cannabis and live vicariously when I could not partake. I stuck around after for their variety of interesting topics and adorable conversation. Keep it up MADAS!"

She's a breath of fresh air, and it's great to listen to a doctor with up-to-date and new ideas, versus the older, more outdated, old-school docs. I can tell you that the information she presents is all very reliable and up-to-date, and she organizes and explains it in a way that I never could. I refer many of my patients to her podcasts! Everyone should listen to her podcasts."
2746,The House Call Doctor's Quick and Dirty Tips for Taking Charge of Your Health,Lost the magic,3,"I really liked this when Dr. Rob was the host. In addition to the information, his personality was engaging and shone through. Dr. Majd just doesn't strike the same chord for me. It's hard to tell if it's the content, personality, or both. But it just doesn't hook me anymore. I just made the decision to unsubscribe."
2747,The House Call Doctor's Quick and Dirty Tips for Taking Charge of Your Health,I miss Dr. Rob!,5,Dr. Rob was funny. I think the new host is fine. I like her better in this podcast then the girlfriend doctor podcast. But why aren't there any new posts?

2750,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Powerless,4,"Step 1 is about coming to terms with the FACT this this thing is controlling you, you don‚Äôt control it. It‚Äôs a power statement that actually gives people their control back vs the addiction to/of whatever having that control. It‚Äôs a powerful statement to say I am powerless over this and I need help to regain control of my life. There‚Äôs a significant difference between emotions, behaviors and substances, so you have to keep it in context. We can‚Äôt never eat again, but I can certain work my program and never use again."

2755,Healthy Mind Fit Body,"good content but irritating banter and too many ""Ya""",4,"I like content if this podcast a lot the topics they chose to discuss and explain and the psychological examination and analysis is all great. But the banter between these two guys can get really annoying and irritating just because they try to be funny and its just not. But I guess people cant really help how funny they are, The most annoying thing off all is how often they say ""ya"" to each other. Its as if its the preahmble to every thought they speak. They need to improve their delivery."
2756,Healthy Mind Fit Body,What I've been missing for a decade!,5,"Wow, you guys have the best balance of information about nutrition and self-esteem that makes listening to your podcasts the highlight of my day. The inner-critic series goes beyond the mainstream ""learn to love yourself"" cliche and really gets at the personalities within ourselves that try to shape who we are. It's completely changed how I view my ""task master"" (forward, slave)! I've had a blast catching up on your old work since I'm new to the podcast world. I think your speaker choices are dynamite. Your laid back attitude makes the information seem interesting instead of preachy. Love it all!! Keep doing what your doing!"

2759,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Psychology of healthy eating habits,5,I really appreciate the deeper view of healthy eating as it is presented in this podcast. I think it's often overlooked just how important the mental/psychological aspect is related to our food choices. The two hosts have done a great job putting together great topics and arranging excellent guests to speak about the science that confirms many of the nutritional facts they bring forward. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a craving for good information that can be put forward towards achieving good health! Keep up the great work Kevin and Wes!!!
2760,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Humorous Hosts,5,"Kev and Wes are quite entertaining in their presentation of health/fitness material. They address both hot topics and also current research in a light manner. I love the sarcasm, though it has been mellowed a bit after listener complaints."

2764,Healthy Mind Fit Body,"Excellent podcast --- entertaining, informative and worthwhile",5,"I have checked out many of the podcasts available about health, diet and exercise.

I've always been pretty fit but since my forties I felt my energy level going down and I thought it was just normal aging. Also I was eating less and less to keep from gaining weight, but I hadn't made the connection!
Following your advice I replaced sugar and starch with more greens and fat (I would only eat the leanest meats before), and now that I eat as much as I want of healthy foods I feel like I'm ten years younger! And I look younger too, gone are the love handles and the weird skin problems I kept having. Thank you for helping me get back to health and enjoying life!"
2772,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Be positive,3,"I find the information to be useful. I don't believe in the Palio diet, but I take the good interviews and info and put it to good use. The host are very down, and seem negative versus sharing a positive view and motivating the listener to make positive small changes. The host just muck in a sarcastic way the so called common knowledge instead of just focusing on good info and leaving personal politic views out."
2773,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Superb podcast!,5,Love love love these guys! Both are very knowledgable and informative. I've learned so much from them. You guys have got me hooked; can't wait for the next one!

2776,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Excellent balance to a fit body and lifestyle,5,"I listed to many podcasts on fitness, diet, nutrition and exercise but you are the only podcast that emphasizes that a healthy lifestyle begins ""between the ears."" It is a mind game and you do an excellent job keeping the podcast interesting and informative. I lost 30 pounds over 8 years ago and I have kept it off on my low carb and moderate exercise lifestyle. Your podcast is unique in that it has multi focuses and discusses tools for maintaining your healthy body, not just losing weight. Thank you for an excellent podcast and one I enjoy very much. Joyce Brown"
2777,Healthy Mind Fit Body,"Nice guys, too chit chatty.",3,"The hosts seem like nice guys, they chat and have good chemistry. If you are looking for that, this is may be the podcast for you.
However, I am a very busy person, I like to use listening to podcast as a way to fit learning and information into my day while I drive / do dishes, etc. It helped a bit when I skipped the first 10 minutes or so to get to the meat of the podcast, but for
me, there is just far too much time spent BSing and chatting, to little time spent relaying interesting, useful information."
2778,Healthy Mind Fit Body,Average,2,"If you like the paleo diet.. You'll enjoy this podcast. If you don't, then you won't enjoy this podcast"

2812,PaleOMG Uncensored,Really wanted to like it,3,"While I enjoy the subject matter, the language drove me up the wall. I know it is marked explicit, but most I listen to have that mark because of a couple words but this was every other sentence. üòï"
2813,PaleOMG Uncensored,Juli is the BEST!,5,"I love listening to Paleomg podcast for her light entertainment that makes me giggle. I love her sarcasm and sense of humor. üòä It is just the best. It is like listening to a friend chat!
Her blog is packed full of interesting content and love following her and learning what she is up to. She is extremely honest and open about her life which is VERY hard to do. Yep so if you want to learn about food life and skin with a touch of sarcasm - listen to this podcast !! üòä 5 stars!!"
2814,PaleOMG Uncensored,Pretty awful.,1,"If you‚Äôve ever wanted to listen to a privileged white woman complain about the most non-sensical, uneventful, trivial events ever to occur, this is the podcast for you.
I like her blog - her recipes are fabulous. However, 95% of her podcast is her complaining about first world problems and sounding like a completely spoiled brat."
2815,PaleOMG Uncensored,Totally understand,5,"I understand rebranding, improving and trying out new ways BUT I‚Äôm so sad I won‚Äôt be able to listen to your podcast every Saturday. üò´"
2816,PaleOMG Uncensored,I think we could be BFFs,5,"I adore listening to this podcast and look forward to it each week. She‚Äôs hilarious, opinionated and foul mouthed and I‚Äôm here for it. Love all her tips/info about health and fitness too. You rock Juli!"
2817,PaleOMG Uncensored,PoSiTiVe ViBeSüíú,5,Of course if you love Juli you will love this podcast! It's like chatting with your bff. Juli strives to spread positivity in a world of not so positive things and i LOVE it! Juli is so funny but if you don't like yawning please don't listen and please don't tell her to stop yawning. k? k!
2818,PaleOMG Uncensored,So boring,1,"Why does anyone want to hear 15 minutes about a non-eventful trip to the airport, followed by the product pitch, before ever getting to the point of the podcast?"
2819,PaleOMG Uncensored,"Some really good, some useless episodes",3,"I LOVE Juli‚Äôs blog and have been following her for years, her podcast started off really informative in the earlier episodes and I listened to every single one, but the content has kind of trailed off into more ‚Äòjibber jabber‚Äô more than anything. It‚Äôs not nearly as informative on health and wellness as it once was, but she has a funny personality. I find that I listen to half of her episodes and delete/don‚Äôt listen to the other half if the content is pointless or random."
2820,PaleOMG Uncensored,EBook Episode 102,4,"Yes absolutely do the ebook! Love your content!
- Hattie, Dickinson, ND"
2821,PaleOMG Uncensored,Love her!,5,"Yes, she may swear a *little* too much sometimes, but so do I. Haha love her no BS attitude and confidence. Absolutely addicted to this podcast lately."
2822,PaleOMG Uncensored,üëå,5,"Omg can you stop yawning!!! It makes me yawn !!!! Jk I find it hilarious that people care about that and your water breaks make me think to drink water... so I guess I can forgive you for making me yawn ! I love how you so openly talk about your social anxiety, and the balance
Of being self employed. Keep up the great work it‚Äôs so appreciated !!!"
2823,PaleOMG Uncensored,Pitiful representation of REAL women,1,"Uses the word ‚Äúlike‚Äù too much. Comes off as a narcissistic ignorant valley girl, like oh my gaaaad..... I couldn‚Äôt even finish one episode."
2824,PaleOMG Uncensored,Love you but STOP talking politics!,1,"Whyyyyy??!! Why go political Juli?? I come here bc I love your workout ideas, recipes, even your rants. But this was the one place to not hear politics. And over the last year you have started talking about it more and more. And you say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to bring up politics....‚Äù then don‚Äôt!!!"
2825,PaleOMG Uncensored,Juli is the best,5,"Juli doesn‚Äôt talk about ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù on her blog but rather food, fun, and life (and one time only ever-basic human rights.) A bunch of whiny conservatives are butt hurt because she had the audacity for the only time in 5 years I‚Äôve followed her talk about what it‚Äôs like to be a female for one day in this world. If people don‚Äôt like someone standing up for themselves then they should just move on. Otherwise the convo is about food, life, and it‚Äôs like talking to my friend when I listen."
2826,PaleOMG Uncensored,OMGreatttt!!,5,"***I had to update my review of this podcast after listening to the two most recent podcasts. Juli‚Äôs honesty and bravery blew me away. I really appreciate her willingness to discuss important topics in an authentic and powerful way!! <3
***
I love listening to Julie! I actually learned about her and her blog through GGW. She's honest, genuine, talented and hysterical!!"
2827,PaleOMG Uncensored,Sounded like she would rather be napping,1,"Complained about other people‚Äôs kids and yawned throughout the whole pod cast. She seemed bored by her content and I was to by mid yawn. Eh, I wasn‚Äôt a fan."
2828,PaleOMG Uncensored,I don‚Äôt get the fascination,1,"Between the interruptions, yawning and cussing I have no clue what people love so much."
2829,PaleOMG Uncensored,The BEST,5,Love your podcast so much Juli!!!! So entertaining and motivation. Keep being awesome !
2830,PaleOMG Uncensored,Unorganized and uneducated,1,"If you are looking for an opinion podcast, then go ahead and give it a try. I‚Äôve followed Julie for many years and appreciate all of the free content she puts out. I‚Äôve also purchased her cookbooks and her recipes are great. With that being said, I‚Äôve tried to continue to support her by listening to her podcast and it wasn‚Äôt worth it. There is a lack of content and knowledge behind her topics. She literally just talks about whatever she wants that day. No rhyme, no reason. Her stories go off on insane tangents. The lack of effort put in for the episodes are obvious. She yawns throughout the podcast, does baby voices with her dog and sometimes even eats food in while talking. If there were a point to her podcasting, I truly don‚Äôt understand it. Not worth the time, there are much higher quality podcasts out there that don‚Äôt waste your time."
2831,PaleOMG Uncensored,LOVE,5,Absolutely Love Juli!!! She tells it like it is!
2832,PaleOMG Uncensored,Love!,5,"Juli is a breath of fresh air! Love listening in and the variety of topics covered. Also, I appreciate the humor and no nonsense advice. Great job Juli!"
2833,PaleOMG Uncensored,I can't even...,2,"I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I truly appreciate Juli's free content that she obviously works really hard to put out--her workouts, recipes and fashion have been a staple source for inspiration for years now. But please Juli, stop doing podcasts! The content has really gone down hill, as has her commitment to any sort of professionalism. Not that she was ever really professional, but the quality has plummeted in recent months.
Here's a basic rundown of each podcast (you'll have to remember to insert plenty of ""likes"", distractions, talk about buttholes, insanely annoying tangents, random distractions, excessive yawning, excessive negativity, pointless and annoying conversations with her SIL and general vapidness): a narcissistic (RUDELY) positioned review of life in general that follows no structure, talking smack on kids, men, or anyone not in her gym or podcast clique. Very little informative content about fitness, health and life.
All of the above have been tolerable, but what's not tolerable? Her obssession with working out, her weight and her wrinkles. If she gains 5 lbs, you hear about it for weeks across multiple channels. I'm sure this gets her likes, comments and listeners because that's what wrong with this industry - women are compelled to look a certain way and are influenced by ""role models"" like Juli that just further imprint unhealthy habits and mentalities. They beg for more information on how to lose that stubborn 5 lbs they gained on vacation, or how to look ""perfect"" in a bathing suit, or that they should also be ashamed of their butt. I used to be one of those girls and will no longer be listening to this triggering podcast.
Juli's facade of being the picture of health is false. She recycles canned and disingenuine motivating content on how to be a better person, but don't be fooled."
2834,PaleOMG Uncensored,Negativity and Yawning... Juli is a Mean Girl at heart,1,"I tried very hard to listen over the last almost 100 podcasts because I really like her cooking, I follow her blog and I have bought all her books... but sadly, Juli is mostly negative and yawns non-stop during her podcast. I thought this would improve as she did more, but it doesn‚Äôt. Neither does her negatively. It isn‚Äôt a place to go to be entertained or uplifted. If you like to listen to her complain about her life and neighbors and such, go ahead. Not entertaining in my opinion and I have listened to parts or all of at least 40 trying to like it"
2835,PaleOMG Uncensored,What happened to this podcast?!,1,"I‚Äôm not trying to be a ‚Äúhater‚Äù, not trying to be mean or anything that would cause harm to anyone else but my God what happened ? The episode of GGW Joy&claire doesn‚Äôt even have an intro for God sakes!"
2836,PaleOMG Uncensored,Love this chick!!,5,"I went to write a review about how much I love Juli and her podcast and was disappointed about some of the negative things people say about her.
Juli is real, raw, hilarious, and entertaining. This is not one of those educational/let me take notes during it podcasts, but it‚Äôs her talking about things that a lot of women can relate to. I always feel like I‚Äôm just listening to one of my girlfriends talking & it always entertains me. Juli is real about life struggles (are they world shattering struggles? No, but they impact people, myself included) and seeing that someone who is gorgeous and seems to ‚Äúhave it all together‚Äù struggles with these issues too is refreshing. I‚Äôm a huge fan and am always excited when a new episode comes out! üôåüèª"
2837,PaleOMG Uncensored,Great content but the cussing :(üëéüèº,4,I really like this podcast and think Juli is just the best (obsessed with making her recipes!!) but oh my word I loose count of how many times I hear the ‚ÄúF‚Äù word! I get that this is just her ‚Äústyle‚Äù but it‚Äôs so unprofessional and I can‚Äôt listen to the episodes while driving like I normally do because I don‚Äôt want my 2 year old to hear F bombs. It‚Äôs a shame. I would listen a lot more if there were other descriptive words used..
2838,PaleOMG Uncensored,I love Juli,5,"I love Juli‚Äôs honesty. When I listen to her podcasts, it feels like I‚Äôm listening to a close friend sharing her thoughts and experiences. I love her blog and Instagram posts too! She shares a ton on good info and her recipes and workouts are great! She‚Äôs very relatable and she‚Äôs hilarious. Love you, Juli! Keep being you!"
2839,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,This is how I fight my Battles,5,"I am breaking chains of the world that has had me in bondage since Jan. 2019 when my sister in law shared a RevWell podcast with me. I am training to be healthy and whole. If you are looking to get healthy body, soul, and mind for the Lord- look no further! It is life changing- join the Lord‚Äôs army! Platoon #25"
2840,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Love this mornings 24 March 2020,5,"Just what I needed during these uncertain times of darkness. But, there will be so much good to come from it . Praise Jesus, God Almighty, Savior, Healer and Protector!!

2841,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Changing in The Turn!,5,"I am making that turn toward our father and moving Far away from Fear of All kinds. I am SO great full for your YES to his Call to help set us FREE!! Alissa My warrior sister I cannot express in words how much of an answer to prayer you are! These Podcasts, your Revelation wellness book and all the other Resources have changed me in so many ways! God Bless you and your family and all the ladies that have multiplied the anointing he has bestowed upon you .."
2842,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Look forward to my workouts with Revving the Word,5,"If there is anything out there like Revving the Word or Be Still & Be Loved, I have yet to find it despite many searches. This is a wholly unique resource to help you see holiness while moving your body, being encouraged, and also learning to have times of rest and stillness. Alisa‚Äôs Revving the Word literally makes me look forward to waking up and getting on the spin bike or treadmill. I can‚Äôt wait to hear Gods word, the powerful truths she pulls out of it, and the JAMS she has going in the background. Revving the Word #394 is my absolute favorite right now ... somehow she knew in September exactly what I would need to hear this week. And the Be Still & Be Loved sessions are my favorite way to end the day and get ready for bed or to to recenter after a stressful day at work. Seriously, please check out the Thanksgiving Day Be Still & Be Loved Mashup. You will be incredibly blessed by it. Thank you for reading this!! Now bless yourself and listen!! Enjoy!!‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
2843,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,#440,5,I just listened to #440 what do you Divina with Ephesians 320 through 21. It was such an on time word for what‚Äôs going on now. I‚Äôm working on the Revelation Wellness instructor training for fitness teacher gospel preacher. I was just told yesterday by my supervisor that I might not be able to travel or fly to the training due to travel restrictions. This podcast was a good reminder that He has a plan and it‚Äôs much better than mine.So I‚Äôm gonna keep doing my homework and I‚Äôm gonna wait on him. Thank you for sharing this.
2844,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Just What I needed!,5,These podcasts are amazing! Yesterday the Lord spoke to me through Ephesians 3:20 as my daughter was in the ER with a high fever and pneumonia. And here I come to work out to this weeks podcast and is the EXACT SAME VERSE! And just to testify she came home hours later with no fever no longer coughing chronically and today she was back to her normal self with a little runny nose and slight cough! The Lord is using this ministry powerfully in my life and not just for fitness.
2845,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Best therapy with movement,5,"Revelation Wellness podcast has given me some of the most life changing therapy sessions. Between the intervals and the Be Still and Be Loved, I always have an opportunity to hear truth and be challenged. This has been a ministry that is helping me become more me! Thank you Alisa!"
2846,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Awesome Podcast!!,5,"Alisa, hosts of the Revelation Wellness podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The hosts and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
2847,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,I can relate #334- BII,5,I am so glad I am friends with a Rev Well instructor. Once I opened up about my journey with Breast Implant Illness she told me about this podcast and blog. I relate to so much of what was said and scheduled for surgery in April after 6 years of unknown symptoms. Praising God for the provision and wisdom from others that have gone before me. Thanks for being real and willing to share.
2848,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,This! Life changing!,5,"I have been listening to these podcasts since the beginning of the year. I go for walks with the ‚ÄòRevving the Word‚Äô and be quiet with ‚ÄòBe Still and Be Loved‚Äô. The words are honest and healing. Not preaching, but words spoken through movement. I am healthier, more at peace and closer to Jesus than I can remember ever being. Highly recommended if you have been involved in dieting or disordered eating and trying to help yourself. This showed me that I needed to find Jesus to find healing and He‚Äôs been with me through it all."
2849,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Changing the way we view life,5,"This podcast has helped me work through to STUFF. I absolutely love the revving the word and be still & be loved episodes. Never in my life did I realize how much we can process and let go of by moving our bodies while listening to some powerful scripture. It is SO GOOD.
Revelation Wellness has taught me how to make my weight loss journey about more than what I do with my body. It‚Äôs about my relationship with myself and God. They‚Äôve helped me break down walls and build myself up again. Amazing. 10/10. Let‚Äôs go."
2850,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,So freeing!,5,"Wow. I just listened to #334. That episode brought me so much peace. Just knowing that I‚Äôm not alone in feeling insecure. To see the pain that the breast implants brought and that it wasn‚Äôt satisfying was really eye opening. I‚Äôve always picked parts of myself I didn‚Äôt like. Ever since I was little I would compare myself to the other girls. First it was my stomach I didn‚Äôt like, but then I slowly started finding other ‚Äúproblems‚Äù and eventually there weren‚Äôt many parts of myself that I genuinely found beautiful. I can very much relate with the need to feel loved. Always trying to be pretty or have a good body to appeal to a guy. I‚Äôm a Christian so I was always trying to stay pure as far as relationships go. I would never have an ungodly relationship, and am very in tune with that. However, something inside of me felt this desire for love. And I thought it could be satisfied by a man or people. But people fail me. And if God‚Äôs love isn‚Äôt enough for me, how can the frailty of a human‚Äôs love be fulfilling? Believing the enemies lies was a cycle for me. I didn‚Äôt even try to find truth. I just believed what he said. All I can say is thank you. Thank you so much for sharing your story. God brings good out of brokenness. You are so inspiring and a beautiful example of Christ‚Äôs love. Keep doing work for the Kingdom! ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üëè"
2851,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Cannot Say Enough Good Things,5,I have reviewed this podcast before but I had to come back and edit it because the episode from Alisa where she explains her reasoning for getting breast implants hit me harder than any podcast has before.
2852,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Teaching,5,"Listening to the teaching while working out and/or just simply moving my body in obedience has been life changing. The teachings have fed my soul while the work outs have made me stronger mentally and physically. I am thankful that my friend introduced me to the Revelation Wellness Community.

2853,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,God is taking my workouts to a whole new level!,5,"I always thought is had to run and workout to loud, angry music. This podcast has changed all that. I started listening thinking I‚Äôd only be able to use this for walks but the more I listened, the more God told me how He wanted my body to move! Some days it is a restorative walk but other times I hear God challenging me spiritually and physically, telling me to push my limits. And He is so faithful because He always gives me the workout I need that day. I love both the intervals and the endurance workouts.. the music is uplifting and God‚Äôs word being spoken over me restores all of me. I‚Äôm so thankful for this ministry. It has forever changed fitness in my life."
2854,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Phenomenal,5,"This podcast has changed the way I exercise! I used to run as punishment, out of fear, and to escape. Now I run as worship, in freedom and for freedom, and to lean into the one true safe place - our God‚Äôs open arms. Never before had I used my workout time as a quiet time, but Alisa has been faithful to let God speak through this podcast and bring truth to my soul as I move. This is my rescue story!"
2855,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,So good,5,"This is the first podcast I‚Äôve ever connected with. I learn so much practical knowledge about how my mind, body and spirit are connected but more than that it‚Äôs a reminder that God loves me. What a gift."
2856,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Life changing and life giving,5,"This podcast has absolutely positively 100% changed my life. It has transformed this recovering striver, overexerciser, restricter to someone who looks forward to moving her body as a get-to and a way to connect with the One who made her. It has completely RUINED how and why I work out in the BEST way. I have discovered the God who has been by my side the whole time, just waiting for me to look up and notice. Thank you Alisa ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anne"
2857,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,You taught me to Breathe!!,5,"Alisa, episode 399, you taught me to breathe. To breathe deep into the 3 levels of my core, but not only in my physical body but into my soul and spirit. This podcast has helped me grow deeper in my relationship with God and a bonus of helping me grow in a relationship with my own self. Healthy and whole. I love this podcast!!!"
2858,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,BRAVO!,5,"From one podcaster to another‚Ä¶ BRAVO!
One of my newfound favorite podcasts! Why has it taken me so long to find you? I head to the gym 5 days a week and go for long walks the other 2. Now I have the perfect listen for, not only my walks, but the cardio portion at the gym.
Thank you for your faithfulness and truth in keeping to the Word of God. This is truly an encouragement to my soul!"
2859,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Pure. Solid. Gold! LIFE,5,"Alisa‚Äôs heart shared and God‚Äôs word speaking through her voice, over me in the Be Stilll & Be Loved have brought me all the way back to life numerous times! I am so so grateful for her and her obedience to this beautiful calling on her life! Every time I hear a podcast, I literally say out loud, ‚ÄúI freaking love you, Alisa!‚Äù This is the top of my many podcast! Thank you, sweet Alisa üíú May God bless you and fill you with His grace and Love!"
2860,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Even in the Middle East,5,"I am a 21 year old senior in college and found Rev Well via Instagram when I was a Junior in high school, at the height of an eating disorder born from the pressures of being ‚Äúthe perfect athlete.‚Äù I distinctly remember being shaken by captions about exercising for the love and glory of God rather than fear of what my body would look like if I didn‚Äôt. Since then, cycling and praising God like a fool in my college gym to Revving the Word and weeping on the floor of my dorm to Be Still and Be Loved podcasts has led me through and out of some difficult times.
Currently I am studying abroad in the Middle East and have faced incredible challenges and even some persecution. My soul has been unsettled and my body often feels like it doesn‚Äôt belong to me. But God is good, and He has yet again brought me to Rev Well as the vehicle to bring me back to His truth, hope, and peace. I‚Äôm in the middle of Jordan, and listening to Be Still and Be Loved on my walks to school, realigning myself with the kingdom as I go."
2861,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,So blessed!,5,I‚Äôve been following Rev for a long time now. It‚Äôs changed the way I view fitness and live my life. This podcast is nothing but a breath of fresh air that goes into my ears and through my body! So thankful and blessed to know this ministry and Alisa!
2862,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Great podcast!,5,This latest podcast on how to have lasting change is exactly what I needed to hear before the family shows up for the holidays. I love my family but sometimes they get on my nerves. I need to be kind and remember that God is kind to me. Thank you so much for sharing these beautiful words and pushing me toward freedom.
2863,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Amazing podcast,5,I have been a listener for the last 4 years after having my first boy. I now have a 4.5 year old and a one year old. This podcast helped me get moving and get reconnected to god. My first son was born 10 weeks early and it was a tough tough first year. Physically it took me a long time to heal. I developed HELLP syndrome and was so sick my liver almost failed which is why he was born at 30 weeks. The message behind the podcast of keeping god first is just so important and keeping our bodies moving and healthy is so important. Thank you for this podcast which has helped me more than I can say!
2864,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,"Move your body, Grow in Jesus",5,"I cannot recommend this podcast enough. It is helpful for teaching, meditation, getting me up to workout and move my body to the glory of God.
Alisa is encouraging, kind, WISE. Her book, her podcasts, just do it all. Your life will be better for it because it all starts in the heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you Alisa!!!!!"
2865,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,For You!,5,"I just finished instructor training! Platoon 23!
I didn‚Äôt know about these podcasts until about 10 weeks ago. They help me so much. They help me with my quiet time with God and to workout without spending a lot of money on a gym. I highly suggest you add these to your daily routine!"
2866,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,The BEST!,5,Thank you for this ministry! I can‚Äôt go for a run without you!
2867,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,Thankful!,4,"Podcast # 399 showed me I did not have enough scripture memorized and only had a few that I could shout out during the silence. The Lord put on me this week to start memorizing verses, I have shared these with my family and work family. I am thankful for Alisa showing me how to worship more and grow closer to the Lord. My prayer is to be set free from the control of food and be free from the stronghold of all food. I want to just have a normal healthy feeling for food and not dwell on foods! And I understand that maybe this has been a struggle to bring me closer to the Lord and seek Him and learn to tell others of His love. Been in church all my life but I am closer to the Lord more now than I ever was. Thankfully He never left me!
Deena C."
2868,Revelation Wellness- Healthy & Whole,So motivational,5,"You taught me how to breath today, how to fill up on Gods word. I thank God for you!"
2869,Food Heaven Podcast,Fantastic,5,I recently started listening to this podcast and following food heaven on Instagram after a recommendation from a couple cooks. I had asked them for a good resource to help me learn how to get what I need (nutrient wise) from a mostly vegetarian diet‚Äî I feel like I‚Äôve already gotten so much more than that! The pod is great so far and I love how they are breaking diet culture and ditching the idea of being afraid of your body shape/size. Give this podcast a listen! It‚Äôs good for the soul!
2870,Food Heaven Podcast,My favorite RD‚Äôs,5,"You can trust this podcast to discuss a broad range of evidence-based nutrition topics as well as delicious food. The hosts share personal stories so you feel like you connect with them on a personal level. Also, they emphasize relying on Dietitians for nutrition advice and not influencers!"
2871,Food Heaven Podcast,Great podcast!!,5,"This is an excellent podcast! The hosts have good personalities and present quality, factual nutrition information. The topics are interesting and cover a wide variety of issues."
2872,Food Heaven Podcast,Diversity of topics,5,"I thoroughly enjoy this pod, and the diversity of topics within nutrition covered."
2873,Food Heaven Podcast,Okay,2,The two hosts spend the majority of the podcast talking about themselves and things not relevant to the title of the show. I don‚Äôt like having to sit through fifteen minutes of two friends talking about personal things when I want to hear about food and nutrition.
2874,Food Heaven Podcast,Amazing!,5,Super informative and engaging. Love it!
2875,Food Heaven Podcast,Love this podcast!,5,"First heard these ladies on The Friend Zone and have been subscribed ever since. They are a whole vibe and I genuinely appreciate their advice, their perspectives, their mission. I even love hearing about their weekly sponsors lol. I‚Äôve been turned onto Feals & Go Macro bars, and these have been game changing products in my life. Thanks for all you do! Don‚Äôt stop! We need y‚Äôall and we‚Äôre here to support ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2876,Food Heaven Podcast,Thank you so much!!,5,"This is such a great podcast, it‚Äôs so informative and very helpful for me when it comes to navigating the food world and nutrition. Thank You!!!"
2877,Food Heaven Podcast,Really informative and easy to listen to,5,"I like that you guys are focused more on the facts than selling us specific types of diets.
I always learning something from your episodes. The information is really digestible."
2878,Food Heaven Podcast,Good Info Nourishing for the Mind and Heart,5,"Love love love this pod. Gives solid, evidence based info in a compassionate and loving and fun way - check it out. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
2879,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,The adrenaline. Now...need faster than 180bpm!,5,"OMG, these podcasts got me pumped!!!!"
2880,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,"fabulous, fantastic, and perfectly timed!",5,"To the makers of these exercise grooves: THANK YOU! They are all perfectly timed, and perfectly in rhythm with a workout. It's a joy to move and groove with this music. I want to hear more!! Can't wait for new posts and workouts. You've got the right stuff."
2881,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,Excellent!,5,"Absolutely nothing short of excellent.
The upbeat music is heaven esp. when you are on the run and need some motivation when you feel you can't go any further.
The bpm's aren't ridiculous either. Great stuff!
I just wish the uploads were more frequent. It's already the end of November and the latest upload was on October 10. Otherwise, I use this podcast all the time during all of my workouts."
2882,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,WHAT A GREAT PODCAST!,5,I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO EXERSIZE PODCASTS FOR A FEW MONTHS AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS ONE IS THE BEST!! GOOD MUSIC AND GOOD ADVICE - I SUGGEST EVERYONE GIVE IT A TRY!!
2883,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,How cool! I used to take Terri's classes in NYC!!! She rocks!,5,"Wow! How thrilled and surprised was I to pop this into my ipod and see my old instructor from Crunch??? Yo GO GIRLLLL. This woman is the REAL DEAL. I have never taken a class that good since I left NYC, and boy do I miss it. This workout got me psyched again. What a great surprise!
I've been using it with light weights one day for a quick cardio (sometimes I do it back to back) - then the next time i do the workout i use heavier weights and go slower for more toning. She always was efficient like that, and always includes ways to make something work for you. I told my mom about it and she's been using it too. Yay video ipods!!!"
2884,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,efficient. effective. clearly expert.,5,"loved all these podcasts. i don't think they expect you to follow along at the same time, like one reviewer mentioned. it was clear to watch first, but whatever - i asked a question at their site and got an answer to my question about the yoga podcast in under 30 minutes. i sweat my butt off and was impressed by both instructors. can't wait for more!"
2885,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,Impeccably done! Great if you're crunched for time :),5,"I loved UpperBody-Beg! Brilliantly and beautifully thought out. Professional, and efficient! I loved the pace and focus of the workout. The instructor has excellent technique as well as very clear concise instruction. I've even reccommended it to my studio owner as we're looking for ways to bring weight training into our dance academy, but can't spend alot of time in class.
I thought it was challenging, yet accessible and I'm keeping it in my pod!"
2886,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,These podcasts are awesome!,5,"I've used the Upper Body podcast and the Yoga one and they're both helping me lose 20 lbs!
I've been alternating them in between my gym workouts and they're easy to incorporate into an existing fitness program. I also learned some new stuff I didn't know before.
When I checked out the site I found alot of great info there too. What and awesome concept.
Well done! Keep them coming!"
2887,Exercise-World Fitness Social Network,VideoPodcast Uploaded-Test podcast deleted,5,"Hello Fitness Fans...
We're uploading our first video podcast today 6/8/06 - the test podcast will be deleted. We hope you enjoy our first effort and we look forward to producing more (and getting better at it as we go!)"
2888,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Such a game changer,5,"Thanks so much for generously providing this podcast. It has helped change my outlook on life and really made a difference for me. I related the content so much, even though I don‚Äôt have kids and work in a medical-related field rather than being an MD. These are such valuable tools for everyone. You‚Äôre the best!"
2889,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,New mindset,5,"Like many reviewers, I heard about this podcast on a women‚Äôs physician group. I don‚Äôt really struggle with my weight but my thoughts can be pretty problematic. Several women wrote about how this podcast changed their thinking, helped them get through their work, enjoy their jobs, erase their burnout, and be more present at home. I have gained so much from listening, particularly during this challenging time. I listen on the way to the office to help get my mind set for the day. And on the way home to try to prepare for the work that awaits there at the end of the day! Thank you, Dr Ubell! You‚Äôre great!"
2890,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Fantastic thought work,5,"I love this woman - Her thought models are GOLD. I really have learned a lot through following some of her thought models, especially a client-interview with a busy ER physician mom. While weight loss is not my goal, creating a world of healthy thought processes has been a game changer. Thanks Katrina - you‚Äôre amazing!!"
2891,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Overrated,1,Overrated. Not sympathetic or emphatic at all. Taking advantage of the current pandemic.
2892,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Started great now unrelatable.,1,Completely out of touch with practicing health care workers now.
2893,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Some good morsels but largely out of touch,2,"Dr. Ubell no longer seems able to relate to practicing physicians, especially as I am working on the front lines in the middle of a pandemic. I have gleaned some good strategies from her in the past, but I no longer find her relatable or applicable to my life."
2894,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,"Started listening March 13, 2020",5,"Dr Ubell,
I started listening on March 13, 2020. I have lost 14 pounds. More importantly I have changed my way of thinking about my job, my relationships, and my life. I am sure more challenges are ahead , however I think with my new tools they will be easier to handle. Thank you for all you do!

Thank you Katrina for sharing all of your amazing knowlegde."
2898,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Thank you!,5,"Thank you for creating this podcast and for continuing to share your wisdom and lessons learned! Learning how to reframe my thinking has been so powerful.
I have shared your podcast with non-physician friends and family members who have found the lessons just as valuable!"
2899,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,LIFE CHANGER,5,I am a newbie binge listening to this podcast from the beginning. I love how I am able to understand my thoughts and how the episodes build upon each other. This is a whole new way of thinking for me and although there are still some bumps in the road this is clearly the piece I have been missing in my weight loss journey. Thank you for this gift!
2900,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Awesome!,5,Enjoying Katrina‚Äôs podcast and appreciate all of the life coaching in the episodes. I am not necessarily trying to lose weight but looking for ways to maintain and not fall off the wagon. Working my way from Episode 1 to the newest.
2901,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,"Great for non MDs, too!",5,"I found Katrina's podcast on a total whim looking up ""weight-loss"" (must have been all those itune reviews pushing it to the top of the list ;) - thank you!) and while it has definitely helped me to lose weight more easily and more sustainably than in the past, the true benefit has been in changing my thinking and making my life SO MUCH better! I have recommended this podcast to lots of folks, none of whom are docs. I have had decades or therapy, spent thousands on personal development courses, and been in 12 step for 10 years and I am learning new amazing and EFFECTIVE tools from Katrina. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
I have been listening to all of the podcasts starting at episode 1 and I am now on episode 67 and just getting around to leaving an itunes review on my laptop. Thanks for the push :)"
2902,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Total mind change,5,"This was recommended by so many physicians. I thought it was great the first time I listened but wasn‚Äôt that life altering. However I think I was too deep in burn out. Starting to listen in a better place, and her topics are AMAZING and applicable to every day. I truly feel like I have more control of my own mind and live in a better place despite the details of my life only being slightly different. Every day I find something I can think about in a more productive and helpful way and this continues to compound itself into a healthier mind and body, and I‚Äôm only about 40 episodes in."
2903,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,So great!,5,"I‚Äôm not a physician but my friend‚Äôs OB recommended the podcast to her. I feel like this is THE best information I‚Äôve ever heard and was motivated to change my behaviors immediately!
Thanks so much for making this a free listen!"
2904,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Life changing,5,"I feel like each episode seems to speak directly to my brain and soul. Her words, ideas, and thought processes are so true and help with things I‚Äôve struggled with for years. This is such a different way to help with weight loss and truly helps with lifelong changes. Thank you Katrina!"
2905,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Katrina uball,5,Katrina really has it figured out I find her message inspirational!!
2906,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Hooray!,5,So happy to have found this Dr. Ubell again. She was my daughter‚Äôs pediatrician. I had my first child as a 4th year medical student and there was so much stress and anxiety involved in that. Dr. Ubell was such an amazing support during that time. Happy to have her back! I have lost my final 15 lbs of post baby weight with this podcast. Life changing approach to approaching our thoughts.
2907,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Great podcast!,5,I‚Äôm super behind (currently on episode 48) but I listen to this during my morning commute and it‚Äôs so helpful for mindwork surrounding weight loss. I‚Äôve even shared the thought model with friends and family when they‚Äôre working through other problems. Keep the great content coming!
2908,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Love my friend Katrina!,5,This is my favorite podcast and I am an avid podcast listener. Katrina keeps me company on my way to the gym in the morning before work and it‚Äôs the main reason I get up. Everyday I think ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get up‚Äù and then I think- as Katrina taught me- ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ok. I said I‚Äôd get up and go to the gym so I‚Äôm gonna do it.‚Äù And then I get up! It‚Äôs amazing what this thought work has done for me. I‚Äôve lost 12 pounds listening to this podcast and it‚Äôs more than I‚Äôve ever lost in my life. Thank you!
2909,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,very helpful!,5,Thank you for this helpful and informative podcast!
2910,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,"It worked for my daughter, so she is sharing it with me!",3,"My daughter and I are very similar in size. We have both battled that extra 10 pounds for as long as I can remember. She is a physician, and came across your podcast. She called me a couple weeks ago with such excitement. She is losing weight and is basically at her goal weight. She knows I similarly struggle, so am listening and hoping I have similar results..... wish me luck!"
2911,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Love!!,5,Is it weird that I look forward to my commute now that Dr. Ubell is there with me? I love this podcast so much and I love talking about what I‚Äôve learned with others. The episode about our manuals. Pow. Life changer. Thank you!!
2912,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Katrina, host of the Weight Loss for Busy Physicians podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
2913,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,It Starts with our Mindset,5,Katrina lays out the ground work for how to be ‚Äúnaturally thin‚Äù and it starts with our thoughts.
2914,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,So good...,5,"I love the words she uses to describe this content...she always says SO GOOD when something resonates with her. What she is teaching here really is that good, and applicable in every part of life. This is WAY beyond a weight loss thing. This will change how you think and change how you live your life. I am a physician and it does feel like she is speaking directly to me and my specific struggles, often. But I think this context would literally help everyone. I‚Äôve told my mom, my hairdresser, my nurses, everyone about it. I love this podcast and I LOVE KATRINA! So good...seriously."
2915,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Thank you!!!,5,"Thank you Katrina! Although I‚Äôm late to the podcast, this information as helped me so much! Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. And I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm late to the podcast because now I can listen to you daily and on repeat to apply all the principles you‚Äôve taught."
2916,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Truly life changing,5,"Thank you Katrina for truly life changing guidance and advice. I started listening just to see what the buzz was about on social media groups, and now I‚Äôm hooked! I am not listening for weight loss but maintenance and just improving my thinking and day-to-day happiness. Thank you!!"
2917,Weight Loss for Busy Physicians,Listen it‚Äôs so worth it,5,"I am not a physician but my sister (who is) recommended this, as I had some nagging pounds that I wanted to shed. One of the ideas that keeps reverberating in my mind is, to stop making myself feel better with food and alcohol. This podcast has truly helped me see things differently. Special props to episode #41. Appreciate that share. Thanks, Katrina!"
2918,Starting Strength Channel,Brilliant Content on Strength,5,"A
Rippetoe is a brilliant guy who has a deep understanding of human anatomy and biomechanics. A great podcast from a truly original thinker."
2919,Starting Strength Channel,Exactly what strength needs,5,"Must Listen!
If Sam Elliot and Dave Ramsey share a cousin, it‚Äôs Mark Rippetoe. The guy breaks strength training down simply but with that southern style that makes you want to succeed.
He‚Äôs Robert Duvall in Days of Thunder.
Humor mixed with serious data and science. One of the most under the radar pods available."
2920,Starting Strength Channel,Keep up the good work.,5,"Thanks for breaking down strength training into common sense terms. Barbell training has help with my jiu jitsu and physical appearance much more than high volume/HIIT.
JCW"
2921,Starting Strength Channel,Blackconserve,5,Keep pushing down the left
2922,Starting Strength Channel,True Foundation,5,I wish all who choose to start the weight training endeavor start with this podcast. Rip provides a solid foundation of information. Knowledge is power!
2923,Starting Strength Channel,Hard to take seriously,1,"Just recently saw game changers, and trying to look at both sides for evidence, but their ep on it was hard to take seriously. I'm sure there is a lot of good info on other episodes but they really seem to get high of their own supply while innacurately generalizing the movie. So sensative to the other side they have to say words incorrectly. The whole thing was like your mom in a bathing suite. A real turnoff."
2924,Starting Strength Channel,Repetitive,2,"It‚Äôs good for one episode, and then repetitive week after week."
2925,Starting Strength Channel,Life changing,5,"It‚Äôs a good thing for us all Mark Rippetoe decided to go into strength training instead of starting a cult. He uses a matter of fact delivery and tone to lay out simple arguments that leads one to the unerring conclusion that ‚ÄúRip must be right.‚Äù And he is.
Rippetoe‚Äôs program and approach are that one needs to use resistance in a consistent manner, at regular intervals, and increase the amount resistance in regular, adaptable increments each time. This will cause adaptation and growth in the lifter. And it will.
But beyond that, listening to Rip explain something as basic as how to get a plate off the rack, put it on a bar, and then return it to the rack has a surreal entertainment value that is hard to explain.
It‚Äôs like tequila, powerful and to be respected. Not everyone is going to be able a steady diet of it. But a little won‚Äôt kill you and it‚Äôs a good time."
2926,Starting Strength Channel,Don‚Äôt miss this one,5,How can you not like a show where the host has hard nipples? Arguably the most informative and humorous podcast in the S&C industry.
2927,Starting Strength Channel,Building Strength,5,I just came across this podcast from MOTW podcasts. I am getting back to the basics. Stronger each week in 5 pound increments. Thanks
2928,Starting Strength Channel,Great listen,5,Love the info and great guests for strength and conditioning
2929,Starting Strength Channel,exactly what I was looking for,5,"I am new to Starting Strength, but I am reading the book and was delighted to find this podcast. I throughly enjoy the show and look forward to every opportunity I have to listen to it."
2930,Starting Strength Channel,If barbells could talk,5,"If barbells could talk they would be like Mark R. They would have his voice, his attitude, his practicality and his effectiveness. This podcast reminds you how simply and rare and hard to follow the SS program is"
2931,Starting Strength Channel,Listen to Rip,5,Good information and great humor.
2932,Starting Strength Channel,Superior information,5,"Rip gives away more beneficial content than other people sell. I don't understand how or why he does it.
You can subscribe to this channel and watch the form videos on YouTube and you are all set. I world suggest however to buy the books just for a great reference.
Sometimes I don't understand his business model . I am thankful for all of this information don't get me wrong. But like I said before he has given away more superior information than most programs have sold.
It is simply the best."
2933,Starting Strength Channel,As Good As It Gets,5,If you're looking for reality-based strength training information then you're at the right place. Doesn't get better than this.
2934,Starting Strength Channel,Top 3 fitness podcast!,5,If you want to get strong here's your podcast. Starting strength is straight to the point and has no gimmicks.
2935,Starting Strength Channel,Nothing to write home about...,3,Sounds like the strength coach that ripped my hamstring in college...There's better strength and conditioning podcasts that are more science based and less Rip driven.
2936,Starting Strength Channel,Great podcasts.,5,The best podcast out there for strength training bar none.
2937,Starting Strength Channel,Best and most informative strength podcast,5,"If you are looking to get strong and have a better quality of life, then this is the podcast for you."
2938,Starting Strength Channel,Change,5,Changed how I viewed working out for 25 years and totally for the better. If your 20 something start now. You will not regret it or start at 50 like me.
2939,Starting Strength Channel,No BS!,5,Best common sense advice I've heard on strength training!
2940,Starting Strength Channel,Learn from the Master,5,"Mark Rippetoe delivers his advice on everything related to getting strong using the barbell exercises. His advice comes from literally thousands of hours of training and coaching people from all walks of life, combined with his own considerable powerlifting experience. One of the best podcasts out there, I can't recommend it enough."
2941,Starting Strength Channel,Age & Fat,5,Excellent.
2942,Starting Strength Channel,Good information,5,Always like to hear Rip‚Äôs take on the Ask Rip and the various articles.
2943,Starting Strength Channel,A Lie Agreed Upon....,5,Very well formulated opinion from Rip...back up by proof. 5 Stars.
2944,Starting Strength Channel,Q an A episodes,2,"Generally Q an A episodes are quite interesting and entertaining.
His Q and A‚Äôs are like sitting at the bar with your inebriated grandfather.
Look I get it, but being a bitter old man, hubris, is not genuine...
Thanks"
2945,Starting Strength Channel,The plain truth about getting stronger,5,"I learned about Mark Rippetoe when I starting to learn to squat and really committing to getting stronger. Eventually I started Powerlifting, then competing, and eventually several World Records in Powerlifting. I have a good coach and a knowledgeable strength community. 4 years at competition level and immersing my self in the strength sports and helping others get fit by getting stronger, my experiences have led me to believe no one knows more about building strength then Mark Rippetoe. I respect his practical evidence base approach to getting stronger. He has a no nonsense approach that can be applied to ANYONE! Before you fall for the BS touted by so called fitness ‚ÄúInfluencers‚Äù and fads, listen first to Rip."
2946,Starting Strength Channel,An Interview With ...,3,"Just be warned that any episode that features and interview you should expect that Mark mark ask a question, then cut the interviewee off after 10 words, then answer the question himself."
2947,Starting Strength Channel,Just love this show,5,"Rip is, per standard, frickin awesome lol. I love the Rippetoe take on pretty much all matters and the show is outstanding for the entertainment value alone. Couple that with rock solid, time tested, proven methods and great information and you have the best tool (besides barbells) to get in the best shape of your life. Starting Strength is a game changer. And this is hands down the most useful podcast on the interwebs. Thanks, and keep em coming!"
2948,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Who is your Favorite woman trainer,5,I just started listening to your podcast and I‚Äôm really enjoying it. I know a lot of your stuff is geared to men but do you have a favorite woman trainer/podcaster that you would suggest!
2949,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Helpful for all Ages,5,"Awesome podcast. I just turned 29 years old and love training. I did local professional wrestling for 11 years and all of the practical, joint friendly training has helped me tremendously from the wear and tear from wrestling and put me in a position to continue loving training as I move into my 30s and beyond as I raise my 2 young kids. You‚Äôre the man Jay!"
2950,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,New Listener,5,"Hey Jay, my name is Joshua Meadows and my trainer turned me on to listening to you in recent days.

2951,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Best Podcast Out There,5,"I have been following Jay‚Äôs stuff since I stumbled on his blog after I graduated college back in 2010. I‚Äôve been a member of the RSC and now Renegade Strong since that time. I used to go to his blog multiple times per week hoping to see a new post. Things haven‚Äôt changed a bit except now I check my podcast app just as frequently instead of the blog. I listen to a handful of fitness podcasts but Jay‚Äôs is the only one that I listen to regardless of the topic. If your into fitness, self improvement, motivation, old school hip-hop, wrestling, and even comedy, then Jay‚Äôs podcast is a must subscribe."
2952,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Jay,5,"I really enjoy listening to Jay. It‚Äôs almost like hanging out with one of your boys who happens to be an expert in training. I used listen to different strength training podcast, but a lot of times those guys would speak over the everyday guy‚Äôs head. Not Jay he makes it easy to understand and his passion comes out through that."
2953,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Thank You to You and Jack,5,"Hey Jay,
My name is Bacilio and I‚Äôm a long time follower of your stuff. I recently subscribed to your Renegade subscription monthly workouts and I wish i would have done it sooner. The workouts have massively helped with my low back pain being almost non existent all while making steady gains. I have a home gym and luckily I can do most everything. I don‚Äôt have dumbbells so I substitute land mine stuff and body weight stuff with bands and a weighted vest.
I do jiu Jitsu a lot - not now because of the pandemic - but my body felt shot after lifting heavy all the time for low reps and trying to train. Now I‚Äôm feeling great - so thank you very much.
Can you do me a favor and tell Jack Penner thank you. I don‚Äôt know if he remembers me but a while back in 2017 I wrote him a message and he responded. I asked him for some advice on getting into Physician Assistant school. I remember him going to MD school about the same time. He gave me valuable advice on my essay. Needless to say - I go in that year and I am now a practicing physician assistant. I like to think it was because of him.
To anyone reading this - Jay‚Äôs stuff is so valuable and I wish I would have signed up earlier. I didn‚Äôt because I was I‚Äôm school and in debt - but if I had the money i would have done it sooner.
Best Wishes Jay and thanks to you and Jack. I‚Äôll keep following your stuff and competing the weekly lifts.
- Bacilio Ruiz"
2954,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Quarantine,5,"Great pod Jay really enjoyed all aspects. I think you nailed it as far as eating healthy and taking key supplements. I haven‚Äôt tried athletic greens yet mainly because I juice celery, apples, ginger, and cucumber as often as possible. Obviously lately it‚Äôs been difficult to get all the ingredients lately so I may look into the green supplement. Thanks again for keeping us informed and safe.
Stay strong,
Matt"
2955,Renegade Radio with Jay Ferruggia: Fitness | Nutrition | Lifestyle | Strength Training | Self Help | Motivation,Thanks!,5,"I've been listening for about five years now and have enjoyed watching your own evolution while greatly helping mine!

The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
2958,Super Human Radio,Too many ads,2,"Content of the podcast is amazing. Just way too many ads. The JRE podcast is one of the biggest podcasts in the world, and does it right. Ads at the beginning and the end, because he cares about his listeners."
2959,Super Human Radio,Open honest and informative,5,Carl is a wealth of knowledge and i appreciate and appreciate his open and honest personality . Im a 57 year old PT and Wellness Coach with a keen interest in anti aging for myself and my clients and constantly learning something new from he and his guest.
2960,Super Human Radio,Carl's the Man,5,"I've been listening to Carl for over 6 years now and I've learned so much over the years. He produces a lot of content so I only have time to listen to shows that really interests me. But when I do listen, I always learn something new. And Carl's not afraid to admit when he's wrong."
2961,Super Human Radio,Life Teachers,5,"Just listened to Carl and Mike Mahler, you guys are awesome, I learn so much from you guys, thanks for everything that you these us. SHR#2307"
2962,Super Human Radio,Very informative and fun to listen to,5,"I can‚Äôt remember how I discovered this show but boy am I glad I did. I have learned so much from Carl, especially the dangers of long term keto. I really like his sense of humor and he‚Äôs very knowledgeable in so many topics. I highly recommend it."
2963,Super Human Radio,Amazing!!,5,I have listened to this podcast for almost 10 years now. Carl has been one of the most important and positive influences in my life and we have never met. The information from this show is the only reason my mother is alive today (pancreatic cancer). You are missing out if you are not a regular listener. Thank you Carl!!!
2964,Super Human Radio,Always learning,5,"I've been listening to Carl for many years and have learned so much from him and his guests. I wish I had his rentention of knowledge! His commitment to health and fitness is nothing short of inspiring. ""Muscle is metabolic currency, get in to the gym and make a deposit today!"" I will do that Carl, and continue to do that throughout my life. Thanks friend for your support and encouragement to all of us in your audience."
2965,Super Human Radio,Super cast! Super info!,5,"Carl has spent over 10 years grilling the best minds in the health and fitness space, and somehow has RETAINED everything learned on his shows from that time. The man has a mind like a sponge. He also has a giant heart, as he has made it his personal responsibility to better the human condition by doing everything he can to find the answers to chronic disease, suffering, obesity...etc. On top of that, you get first person access to world champions, renowned scholars, athletic and supplement insiders, and groundbreaking scientist on the regular. This show is the best part of any time I have to waste."
2966,Super Human Radio,An audio PhD on health,5,"Excellent source of information from the ‚Äòtried and true‚Äô to the ‚Äòtip of the spear‚Äô in leading research on all things health, mind/body/soul. The King of all exercises is the squat; listening to this podcast is like the squat exercise but for your brain."
2967,Super Human Radio,Couldn‚Äôt get any better info for health.,5,"This podcast is the most informative about physical fitness I have ever listened to. The countless topic that I‚Äôve heard from this show has hands down not only changed my life with diet, supplementation and workouts but also to those I share it with. I couldn‚Äôt recommend a better source for info, regarding taking care of your body If you‚Äôre in love with physical culture. Thanks Karl, I will always look forward to the topics you discuss as well as the well informative guest and co host you have on the show."
2968,Super Human Radio,I like it,5,"You may not agree with everything, but there are interesting things to learn in every podcast."
2969,Super Human Radio,The Howard Stern show of health Podcasts,5,"If I could listen to only one podcast about health, strength and antiaging it would be Superhuman radio with Host Carl Lenore. This is a daily show with informative insightful and entertaining guests in the health and wellness field from around the world. Listen once and you will be hooked!"
2970,Super Human Radio,My GO-TO health/fitness podcast,5,"Carl may initially come off as a meathead with some anger issues, but once you give him a chance, you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs actually a very informed physical culturist who is passionate about his beliefs. His interview subjects are always interesting. You will see there are different types of shows he does each week like Casual Fridays w/ Alisa and sometimes the author of the excellent Suppversity blog. This used to be my 2nd favorite health/fitness podcast after Ben Greenfield, but I now find myself listening to Superhuman Radio even more! Listen to a week worth of podcasts and you‚Äôll be hooked!"
2971,Super Human Radio,Physical culture,5,Love this show.
2972,Super Human Radio,This guy knows his stuff!,5,"Carl might sound like some Jersey Shore goomba, but he really knows his stuff! I'm quite impressd. I started reseaching anti-aging, longevity and functional fitness a while back, but now I just listen to his show for most of my starting material. He has great guests on that run the gamut from doctors to physical trainers and athletes and everything in between, all giving great insight into physical development, anti-aging and longevity."
2973,Super Human Radio,One long commercial,1,"Interspersed with very thin understanding of ‚Äúcurrent event"" health information."
2974,Super Human Radio,Super Human Educated,5,I will say without a single RANT.....Carl is always on target. The interviews are conducted with expertise and we learn right along with Carl how to become the Super Humans we were meant to be. His physical knowledge and ability to use information to crack primal needs keeps me coming back for every episode.
2975,Super Human Radio,Very informative,5,This covers some great topics and gets very deep into the information. I suggest picking topics you‚Äôre interested in hearing and listening to those. I‚Äôve found if I‚Äôm not that interested in the topic of discussion it gets boring very quickly.
2976,Super Human Radio,Addicted!,5,"I've been listening to Alisa and Carl for about 5 months and I can't describe how happy I am to have found their podcast. In the world we live in today, where media brainwashes the masses, it can be difficult to have a mind of your own and not follow the ""popular"" ways of living and raising a family. I appreciate their honesty and their stance on very debated issues in our country!"
2977,Super Human Radio,Ads Are Squashing Content In More Clever Ways,3,"The content in this show is really good. Yes, the ads are long, but hey everyone has to pay the bills. What‚Äôs getting annoying is when the host comes back after the ads on to provide more content and starts trying to sell more supplements or promote campaigns to encourage listeners to actually listen to the ads. These practices are pushing me closer to the unsubscribing."
2978,Super Human Radio,Much better info elsewhere,2,"Gimmicky, half-truths, quasi-scientific hocus pocus. The host of this podcast uses just enough scientific window dressing to give the appearance of authenticity. Most of the advice on this podcast falls flat. What Gary Null was to the lay audience of the 1970's, this podcast is to today's generation. Look elsewhere for good training advice."
2979,Super Human Radio,Inspiring health,5,"An inspiring health / physical culture podcast that inspires me to strength train regularly, eat smart, and speak far more confidently with physicians."
2980,Super Human Radio,"Fascinating, educational, and entertaining",5,The title says it all. Carl has been putting out this amazing show for years. It's a great way to keep up with the latest research as well as learning the basics if you're just getting started.
2981,Super Human Radio,A++++,5,A true pioneer in healthy lifestyle podcasts. Carl is the real deal.
2982,Super Human Radio,Become Limitless,5,"This is by far one of the best podcasts in the physical culture space. Carl Lenore has made it his mission to get real answers to questions regarding health, strength, and longevity. I just can't say enough about this podcast. If you want to be superhuman then you must give this podcast a listen."
2983,Super Human Radio,"Get over it, Carl",1,"This is specific to episode 17 where insecure baby Carl Lenore apparently decided to take potshots at me. Both he and his girlfriend or wife or whatever need to get over it.
Number one, he and she are both wrong about menopause with every study on the science of fat gain saying it‚Äôs due to lowered activity. PERIOD. But they don‚Äôt like science, they like nonsense.
Second, here‚Äôs the story: over 10 years ago (TEN YEARS) little Carl asked me to be on his podcast. HE ASKED ME.
Subsequently he said on his wall that soy lowered testosterone and male fertility. I told him that 1 billion Chinese said he‚Äôs wrong.
And like the other insecure children in this industry, he cracked. Suddenly I sucked and didn‚Äôt know anything and he didn‚Äôt respect me.
Remember kids: HE ASKED ME TO BE ON HIS PODCAST.
Well a decade later he‚Äôs still butthurt over me.
Get over it Carl."
2984,Super Human Radio,90% commercials,1,"It's impossible to listen to this podcast. Carl inserts a commercial break every 5 minutes. It's beyond excessive. If you want a little bit of information sprinkled in with messages from the sponsors, this is the podcast for you."
2985,Super Human Radio,BEST Podcast for health and Longevity,5,"One of the best things i like about Carl and this podcast is that he brings on the Authors of the papers that he is discussing and interviews them which shows his insane critical thinking ability to break down the information and ask some of the best questions I've ever heard. This brings so much credibility to these topics and just an immense platform to learn from. BP Power Hour is one of my favorite, and Dr, Jeff is anothe staple. Keep up the good work. I've been listening and learning for at least 7 years now. And i'm not leaving."
2986,Super Human Radio,"Awesome show, highly recommend!",5,"Carl and his guests provide some incredibly compelling content that‚Äôs geared to help you take actionable steps to live a healthier, more well-rounded life.
Highly recommend listening and subscribing to Super Human Radio if you want the knowledge AND mindsets to improve your body, mind & spirit (and experience life with a new physical and emotional resilience as a result)!"

2998,The Evan Brand Show,Wealth of knowledge!!!,5,"I am soo impressed with Evan Brands podcast!! He is cover such important topics in such depth and detail yet still makes it very easy to take in.

2999,The Evan Brand Show,Always interesting subjects,5,"I totally enjoy listening to Evan. The subject matter is always interesting. He gets right to the point, and doesn‚Äôt bore you with an over long interview."
3000,The Evan Brand Show,Information Everywhere!,5,I recently found this podcast and it was been a wealth of information!
3001,The Evan Brand Show,I love this show,5,"Definitely one of my favorite podcasts.! Evan has really great guests and topics, and I am enjoying his style of podcasting and how he shares so much of his life. The added birdsong on one of the current episodes was a wonderful bonus!

3004,The Evan Brand Show,Outstanding podcast,5,Evan Brand's podcast is outstanding. He brings infomation in an understandable way and he teaches on topics that we all need to learn about. What I also love about Evan's podcast is that he helps both adults and children and he encompasses all facets of nutrtion and lifestyle into healing your body.
3005,The Evan Brand Show,So many topics brilliantly covered,5,"I am so happy to have discovered this treasure trove of podcasts. I will continue to listen to others as well, but it‚Äôs almost unnecessary as Evan brings most of the experts that I respect onto his podcast. There are so many that they can almost act as a library to look up specific topics in which I am interested. I also appreciate how dense and concise they are. And when you can augment them with Evan‚Äôs YouTube videos, it really provides a powerful body of knowledge that has helped me to address several health issues."
3006,The Evan Brand Show,Evan Brand is the real deal!,5,"I have been keto and fat adapted for almost 2 years now. It was the first step in trying to get rid of my downstairs problems. I knew I still had to search for answers as every now and then I would still get major attacks. Whether it be what I just mentioned or even panic attacks, I knew I had to keep researching to figure out how I could help my issues beyond just eating clean. I came onto Evan‚Äôs podcasts last spring and I‚Äôm glad I did. He made me aware that regular lab testing will get you nowhere. I was diagnosed with SIBO by my Gastro and of course told I was told not to do probiotics and fermented foods etc. The Gastro/recommended FODMAPS diet wasn‚Äôt really getting me anywhere either. After taking Evan‚Äôs urine test and fecal test, I finally found out after years of conventional testing that I actually have names to my IBS issues rather than just the broad term SIBO. Finding out that I had H pylori and a few other specific types of bacteria that can be eradicated with specific gentle herbs is a great start to my journey of restored health. It has opened up the beginning pathway of letting my body experience what nature intended; homeostasis or giving me back the balanced hormones that make the body run efficiently. I can‚Äôt stress enough how much better I feel since I started on the recommended herbs. We are not supposed to feel rundown and stressed out on the level we have all too well come to accept! I believe a bout of food poisoning that I got while traveling was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back causing me to search for answers. It has taken a lot of patience and perseverance to find answers as in the beginning I was relying on conventional testing. I did the scrambled eggs with the x-ray testing to see that I was digesting my food like I was supposed to be. I did the endoscope down my throat and blood tests to no avail. I can say without a doubt the herb supplements I have been using have helped me tremendously and I have not been having the panic attacks that I was having almost daily or weekly. I know it‚Äôs a journey to get rid of a lot of these issues but Evan knows exactly the order you should go after them and I thank him for this. Evan is a great person to work with during this journey and it is well worth the effort."
3007,The Evan Brand Show,Awesome show!,5,I am loving this podcast. I love the way Evan shares his experience and struggles with his health. I also appreciate that Evan is open to learning from the many awesome guests he interviews. I find this show so informative and more relatable than most health podcasts.
3008,The Evan Brand Show,Can he change your life???,5,"Yes. Yes he can. I listened to Evan‚Äôs podcast for a while when I realized I needed to actually schedule a consultation and start drilling down to the root of my issues. I was suffering from seemingly random symptoms that western medicine sought to attack with prescription medications. Evan did the tests, got the numbers, made a protocol...and here I am three months later feeling better than ever. Don‚Äôt wait, you‚Äôre too important."
3009,The Evan Brand Show,I recommend him to everyone,5,My family is obsessed with Evan brand. He is not only informative but his sweet and caring nature really makes it feel like you know him just from listening to his podcasts. You can FEEL that he cares so deeply for functional medicine and helping as many people as he can. I listen to him daily and it has helped me stay strong in changing all aspects of my life to get to root causes of my illnesses. I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful for finding him!
3010,The Evan Brand Show,I learn something jaw dropping each week,5,I love Evan‚Äôs comprehensive discussions of a variety of health topics. Even when I think I know all there is to know about something I learn something new and fascinating. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone interested in finding root causes of health issues.

One of my favorite podcasts!"
3014,The Evan Brand Show,Great resource for Functional Med!,5,"Evan has a real talent for asking the right questions from his guests. Not only are the guests/topics great, but he translates what can often be complex topics into a conversation that the end consumer can grasp. Definitely worth the time!"
3015,The Evan Brand Show,Make ‚ÄúThe Evan Brand Show‚Äù A Daily Habit!!!,5,"I will recommend this podcast to anyone, as he covers such a vast range of topics beyond functional medicine and gut health. Evan is so down to earth and has a level head on his shoulders, he‚Äôll ask out-of-the-box questions, help you piece together health woes and walk listeners through logical answers! He‚Äôs intelligent, educational, fun, inspirational and spreads hope like a wildfire...and he even offers his own practice to work with patients remotely! I‚Äôm so thankful I stumbled across his content, he‚Äôs definitely one of my role models now. üåø"
3016,The Evan Brand Show,Best functional podcast,5,I love Dr. Evan‚Äôs interview style. He asks all the questions I want answers too. I love that he shares his own health experiences for all of us to learn from. His is by far the best functional med podcast I‚Äôve found. I wish I would‚Äôve found him sooner.
3017,The Evan Brand Show,"GREAT Content - Thank You, Evan!!!",5,"The Evan Brand Show provides such valuable content ALL THE TIME!

3018,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Best Podcast Period!,5,"I downloaded Itunes just to leave a review, I like to listen on spotify. I have known about Joe D. for years now, just learned about his podcast 2 years ago. I have been around S&C for along time and I have learned more from the Industrial Strength show then I have from my certifications and schooling. I love it so much I joined the Defranco Insider so I can learn from the edicational tools they have in the insider. Keep up the great work and content. also put your carts away :)."
3019,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,"Making Progress Again, Thanks to Joe D",5,"I‚Äôve only been training a little over a year, but wish I would have found The Industrial Strength show from the beginning, especially since I started training when I was 40. Joe gives such great advice about training smarter to make progress AND prevent injuries at the same time. The information Joe shares on this podcast alone has helped me overcome some injuries and make progress again after several minor injuries. After listening to almost all the episodes, I have started using his programs (as has my wife and two kids). I can truly say this podcast has helped me and my whole family train smarter and get stronger!"
3020,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,5 Stars that deserves 10 STARS!,5,"Should I say more? There are good podcasters, there are great ones, then ones of EPIC PROPORTIONS. That is Joe D. Joe D falls on a list of a rare-breed of Strength/Conditioning Coaches: He WANTS to teach the ‚ÄúTop-Secret Info‚Äù to us (by first teaching us that it is NOT top secret). Whether you are a new exerciser, an experienced lifter, a stay-at-home mom, or a full-time professional wrestler, Joe D teaches foundational, applicable training techniques and lifestyle habits that we can all take into the REAL WORLD, and be successful. I have been here from Episode 1, will be here to 1000, and beyond! Thank you Joe D for being real, for overdelivering, and looking out for everyone. You ARE an inspiration to many!"
3021,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Game Changer!!!,5,"Honestly, I‚Äôve never been into listening to podcast but you‚Äôre the 1st one and been hooked on since.

That‚Äôs what we all like. Thanks Joe! üí™üèΩ"
3022,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Best strength and conditioning podcast around.,5,"As someone who geeks out on programming and problem solving when it comes to strength and conditioning, Coach D‚Äôs practical, no non sense and down to earth way of answering questions is of the utmost value. The answer, ‚Äúit depends‚Äù is always backed by practical and easily applicable background. As a firefighter, I have a lot of masters to try and please physically to perform well, stay well, and avoid injury. I tune in to each episode and make time during a very busy schedule.
Thank you to Coach D for all of the information and sharing of knowledge!"
3023,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,The Best in the Field!,5,"I have known about Joe for a while now having been a trainer and youth performance coach for about 5 years now. Being a now 31 year old, washed up former 3 sport athlete, also from the great state of New Jersey like Joe, I find so many connections in things he talks about that make listening to him very enjoyable. Then he smacks you right in the face with a boat load of knowledge that you didn‚Äôt even know you needed and you can never go back to not being hooked on this show. I am an early riser so I listen to the show first thing Thursday morning when it drops and it is just as effective as preworkout. I have utilized things Joe speaks of in both my athletes and my own personal training and they are game changers! Thanks for all you have provided and will continue to provide. If you‚Äôre not listening you obviously don‚Äôt want to get better! #jerseyjacked"
3024,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,A Whole New Outlook on Fitness,5,"I‚Äôm not as young as I once used to be.

However, since I found the Industrial Strength podcast I‚Äôve taken Joe‚Äôs tips for lifting longevity, feeding myself with the right supps, and taking care of my body.

3026,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,17 years STRONG! A must listen!,5,"If you‚Äôre not following Coach D I highly recommend it. I‚Äôve been following him for years. With all the myths and contradicting advice on the googles his podcast is real, enlightening, entertaining & practical!
Start listening and you‚Äôll be glad you did."
3027,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Best S+C podcast out there,5,"Joe provides a lot of guidance in the vast and conflicting world of training.

3029,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Unmatched Value,5,"I first heard of Joe D after a few months of starting my garage gym and doing some research on turning my passion into a business. I found him on YouTube and instantly knew he would be an incredible asset to my growth in this industry. Once I found out he had a podcast I started listening to his POWERFUL podcast almost every single day in the car. The information he gives is riddled with gems, he has incredibly intelligent guests on the show, and his programming advice is fantastic.. for anybody interested in trying to be better and make a name for themselves in this industry or just looking to improve on their personal gains in the gym, I couldn‚Äôt recommend joe enough. Joe, thank you so much brother!"
3030,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Entertaining and Educating,5,"Joe‚Äôs podcast is entertaining and educating for an idiot like me! With an IQ of 83 at best I‚Äôve been able to learn and comprehend what Joe talks about in every episode. While joe can‚Äôt do much about my IQ, my training is so much smartlier and my progress is through the roof because of all the incredible knowledge Joe bestows! So no matter if it‚Äôs a level 5 hurricane or 9.0 earthquake, I‚Äôll have the strength and the stability to always put my shopping cart back! Thanks Joe, industrial strong for life!!"

Just wanted to share with you the impact you have without knowing..I‚Äôm 6 years sober as of September 3üí™üèº..2 years ago I almost had a relapse, I was feeling bad about life and a lot of that had to do with being overweight..287 lbs to be exact..I found your show and immediately felt a connection. I‚Äôm a jersey boy, born and bred, tough as nails, blue collar hard surface floor guy.. After binging dozens of shows in a row, you inspired me to hold up my jersey strong reputation and ultimately stopped me from picking up a bottle. Your genuine personality shows through the airwaves and speaks to me as if you were my trainer. Almost 2 years later I listen every week still and truly feel you keep me sober. I‚Äôm down to 211 lbs with 198lbs of lean muscle mass, 8% body fat. Completely ‚Äújersey jacked‚Äù!!!! I owe it to you. Not only am I in the best shape of my life I now have 29 guys on the road, business is phenomenal..Again, you probably don‚Äôt know it, but you touch more people than you think. I hope to shake your hand one day and give you a bro hug, lol..If I start crying a little bit you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs me. Stay great, never forget how much you‚Äôve done for others..
If you ever need floors done I wouldn‚Äôt charge you a dime, haaa. Just want to train with you."
3033,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Much more than just Industrial Strength,5,"I found this podcast 3 years ago when I first became a coach, and I've been playing ""catch-up"" on it ever since. I've made it a point to listen to every episode, because there is too much valuable information to leave any stone unturned. Joe makes you feel like part of his own family and shares an astounding amount of information that will completely transform your mindset and approach to weight training. Having attended one of Joe's CPPS certifications, he's the same sincere, hard-working man in person as he would seem to be from listening to him on the show, and the man's strength coaching genius knows no bounds. It's a pleasure to be a member of the Industrial Strength Nation and the CPPS Family. Thank you, Joe D!"
3034,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,A must listen for all levels of meatheads,5,I've been listening to Joe for years and after training for 10 years and being in good shape I'm ready to get into great shape and his SB911 is exactly what I needed. Looking forward to a great year of podcasts in 2020
3035,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Listen To Coach Joe!,5,"I‚Äôm fifty years old and pretty banged up from a life of working hard. I started listening to the podcast after returning to my gym after a hiatus due to some family situations. I had gained weight back and my mobility was suffering. Listening to the program and following it‚Äôs content my workouts are better, strength is up, weights dropping and mobility is tons better than what it was. And for a guy that has most of his lower back fused and bolts and rods holding it together that‚Äôs a big thing. I still work fifty plus hours a week and refuse to believe I should be on disability. Joes insight helps me with the best ways for someone my age and as beat up as I am to keep doing what I love. Lifting."
3036,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Best fitness podcast,5,"I spent 4 years in college getting a bachelors in Exercise Science, and I have learned more from listening to this pod cast in 4 months. Hands down the best and highest quality of information out there."

3039,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,One of my favorite podcasts,5,"I‚Äôm a 33 year old female who loves to learn how to improve myself and others at the gym. My husband owns 2 gyms, and is a strength and conditioning coach at a college prep school. In addition to working a full time (non fitness related) job, I coach part time at the gyms. Although I mostly coach CrossFit classes, I incorporate what I learn from Joe into my classes and into my own programming. I helped an athlete get not one, but two strict pull-ups, by telling her what exercises she needs to be doing outside of class to target her weak lats and back. My husband is an insider and I have completed numerous of Joe‚Äôs programs. I also recently had a baby, and continued training throughout pregnancy, although modified, my favorite exercises were using the prowler in many different variations that I learned about from this podcast. Not only do I learn something new every week, Joe also keeps me entertained with his down to earth attitude. We‚Äôve never met but he feels like that friend that tells what you need to hear, versus what you want to hear, to help you become not only stronger in the gym, but a better person with his insights on life."
3040,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Wisdom. Humor. Thought provoking.,5,"I have been a listener of the show for a couple years now and it has given me a ton of pragmatic advice to apply as an intern and as a younger S&C coach. I think hearing Joe and other professionals discuss important and at times controversial topics, really helped me expand my mind while in school and on the floor coaching. Joe‚Äôs unique personality is shown throughout and he doesn‚Äôt disappoint with his energy and charisma to back up years of experience and make the world around him better."
3041,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,"Best Podcast period for training, fitness & more",5,"The Industrial Strength show is by far the best podcast for anyone who wants to be a better lifter, trainer, start or grow a business or just be a better person. Joe DeFranco invites you in to be a part of his family and friends each week. His knowledge of training is second to none but he confidently and freely gives of that knowledge. He explains topics on a level that anyone can understand. I have listened to lots of other fitness podcasts and no one can touch Joe D."
3042,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Best Strength/Conditioning Podcast,5,"Joe D. delivers the most consistent and thorough podcast in the industry. Each week Joe shares his expertise in strength and conditioning. Anyone from gym rats, personal trainers, and coaches will benefit from listening to this podcast. His information has changed the way I work with clients and my own training. He shows that there are no shortcuts, but tells you how it is and how to apply legitimate principles to your training and life. If you are looking to become a better, stronger, faster version of yourself/your clients, look no further. Subscribe and enjoy."
3043,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Coach Jimmy Lamour (New Level Performance),5,"I enjoy the shows weekly. Coach Joe keeps it real and is very informative on how to improve your health as well as fitness. I look forward to listening to the show as I know I will learn something that can be used in my training or the training of our clients immediately. Also, Coach Joe has been very influential as to why I started in the training business. In fact, I used his methods via video and manuals to help me run a 4.30 40 yard dash for the New Orleans Saints back when I was training for the pro day. I can‚Äôt thank you enough Coach. Keep up the great work. Lastly, I think the show with your parents was legendary."
3044,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,It teaches me and helps me teach,5,"Joe D‚Äôs show has gotten me past a plateau in the gym, but what I really value is the knowledge I‚Äôm able to pass on to others. I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúfitness guy‚Äù in my family/friend circles, but listening to Joe has helped me communicate better and even influence others to make positive changes.

3046,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,The Best Part of Waking Up...,5,"...Thursday mornings is knowing a new episode of the Industrial Strength Show will be waiting for me that day. Each week Joe has new content that I find relevant even though I am quite likely not the typical listener. Great guests, expert guidance on programming, and helpful answers to questions makes for his winning combination. Thanks Coach JoeD for your attention to quality and the time you dedicate to providing an excellent podcast each week!"
3047,Joe DeFranco's Industrial Strength Show,Insightful and impactful,5,"Joe D‚Äôs stories and guests are extremely intelligent and helpful. Joe D has helped impact and change my life, and motivate to be better overall. Great stuff, and continue to provide great content with the old and new guests."
3048,The Running for Real Podcast,Anyone who gives this a 1 star review is a very sad soul,5,"For all past and future listeners and reviewers, any 1 star review is a hate-mongering, very sad soul. Some humans find joy in loathing at others happiness or misfortune. Shameful, ridiculous. This podcast is excellent. I thoroughly appreciate all of the genuine and honest advice, experiences, and stories from Tina and all her guests."
3049,The Running for Real Podcast,Great training podcast!,5,"Tina does a great job of asking the questions that all us ""real"" runners are thinking. Very relatable and helpful material on training, racing, mental game, strength training, avoiding injuries. It‚Äôs obvious that Tina cares deeply about the running community and providing quality content for her listeners. Thanks Tina!"
3050,The Running for Real Podcast,Always look forward to these!,5,I started listening to this podcast a little over a year ago and Ive kept listening because I love how Tina is not afraid to advocate for what she believes in and values. While I love running topics I also appreciate that she doesn‚Äôt steer away from important conversations-including all types of perspectives/walks of life. After listening I always feel encouraged not only as a runner but as a person. Love this podcast!
3051,The Running for Real Podcast,"Wonderful, down-to-earth, encouraging podcaster and more!",5,"I have been listening to Tina Muir since she hosted a different podcast, so have been with her from the beginning of Running4Real, as well as part of her Facebook group. I have met her in person, and have taken her Mental Training course. I am a very slow back of the pack runner who is twice her age, and yet Tina has always, without fail, been very encouraging, welcoming me as a real runner without a hint of irony - while being very down-to-earth and completely relatable. She is the same person, whether on the podcast interviewing an elite, a running science expert, or a heroic everyday runner - as well as in person. She provides good information, from her own experience as an elite as well as through the guests that she hosts and well-researched from good sources. I highly recommend this podcast to any runner, whether just starting out or long-time competitor."
3052,The Running for Real Podcast,Self absorbed host,1,"Loves to talk about herself and how she is always so real. If you feel the need to repeat constantly how real you are, you‚Äôre not very sincere. Guests are often very opinionated on subjects not related to running or make clumsy connections from running to their non running thoughts, often with Tina cheering them on. I listen to running podcasts to hear about running not the hosts‚Äôs political beliefs. Some guests are borderline racist and sexist with Tina‚Äôs nod. I have been listening since nearly the beginning but now it‚Äôs time to move on. A shame because it once was a good running podcast."
3053,The Running for Real Podcast,Eager to hear more,4,"Tina,
Been listening to your podcast every week now. As a half marathoner looking to up my game and see what I can do, I‚Äôm eager to hear from other runners. Registered for my first full this year that was cancelled. You recently said you have different professionals in the show, but in my opinion you are a running professional. I‚Äôd love to hear you talk about running, technique, PRs, gear, how to stay motivated as a mom, woman and runner, especially when you are not feeling it. Keep up the great work!!"
3054,The Running for Real Podcast,Favorite podcast on running,5,"This has become a mainstay in my podcast list and my primary podcast about running. Tina is so genuine and real and I love the topics that she explores with her guests. She has a curiosity about how people grapple with competition, self-doubt, comparison, all the mental stuff - and I share that fascination. How do we all become better people? I‚Äôve had the chance to meet her"
3055,The Running for Real Podcast,Offsetting the moronic 1-star review,5,"If the person who doesn‚Äôt like this podcast wants to be a miserable troll, hiding behind a cell phone...I‚Äôll offset it with positivity and a more broad perspective."
3056,The Running for Real Podcast,Perspective,1,"People are dying and you ask, ‚ÄúWhat if your race was cancelled, how do you stay motivated when your bummed about missing a race?‚Äù Some perspective would serve you well."
3057,The Running for Real Podcast,Best Place for Runners,5,"I first started listening to Running for Real in January, but waited a couple months to write this review. From the very first episode I listened to, every single one has had some nugget of wisdom that speaks to me as a runner. (Yes Tina, I just called myself a runner. Not sure I would have done that before listening to your podcast!) Her easy, coffeehouse conversation approach to each episode is refreshing; she almost always asks the questions I have in my own head listening to her guest. This podcast isn‚Äôt just fun to listen to - it‚Äôs made me a better and more mindful runner!! Thanks for all you do, Tina!!"
3058,The Running for Real Podcast,"Informative, inviting, and easy to listen to",5,The conversational vibe makes this podcast super easy to listen to. So many great topics covered and lots of useful information packed into every episode I‚Äôve listened to so far.

3062,The Running for Real Podcast,Host is an Elite Runner and an Elite Human,5,Tina has running chops and gets the best guests but what sets this show apart is Tina‚Äôs sincere interest in improving all aspects of the human experience.

It‚Äôs so refreshing to be able to relate to someone who isn‚Äôt trying so hard to be perfect and polished like a lot of podcast hosts.

Please leave the politics at home. I just want to hear about running! Most of the time Tina does a fantastic job, good choice of guests, and good questions."
3068,The Running for Real Podcast,Nice variety of guests & topics.,5,"I've really enjoyed¬†listening to the broad range of guests from professional runners to movie directors and authors, all with the common¬†thread of sharing a love of running. Tina finds a way to have real conversations, and to connect with her guests and listeners in a comfortable way.¬†¬†"
3069,The Running for Real Podcast,"Episode 159 Dr. Jennifer Guadiani,",5,"This was an exceptional podcast. I the information is perfect for everyone. I know Dr Guadiani is focused on disorders but don‚Äôt we all have some kind of disorder to some degree? I love her stance on food, enjoy it, don‚Äôt deprive yourself. Obviously she isn‚Äôt saying eat a whole package of cookies but the idea that we mentally beat ourselves up over one cookie is crazy.
Thank you Tina and Jennifer for honesty.
Mike

3070,The Running for Real Podcast,Amazing Show,5,"I started running very recently after being lazy for about 10 years. I finally got off the couch, ran a 5k and changed my outlook on life.

Best running podcast on the internet.
Chris Gaidrich"
3076,The Running for Real Podcast,"Great podcast & an authentic host, but still room to get better",4,"Clearly Tina loves what she does which is awesome! I really appreciate her vulnerability and honesty with each topic. I also enjoy the expertise and different perspectives her guests bring to the show. The only thing that I find problematic is some podcasts are filled with leading questions where the response of the guest feels predetermined because of how the question was posed. Overall, I enjoy listening and learning!"

3100,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Pretty good keto podcast unless you‚Äôre Mormon.,3,"I was looking for keto podcasts and was drawn to Drew for his reviews not knowing much about his fit 2 fat stuff and then you get these weird tangents about Mormons. I grew up with some and never had any problems but i appreciate the Keto info, but if he had bad experiences I don‚Äôt get what that has to do with Keto.
Would have been four stars on the Keto info, but got three stars for the weird Mormon hating segments."

3105,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Love it! And now a question...,5,"Love the show and now the podcast. It's very inspiring to see someone experience what I'm going through. Ive been in stellar shape my whole life, even during and after pregnancy, until recent health issues (adrenal, hormonal, lymphatic). My healthy lifestyle didn't change, and yet I ballooned over 100lbs in a year. Because my lifestyle wasn't the catalyst, I can't seem to lose enough weight now that my health issues are slowly getting under control. I've lost a bit and the rest won't budge. I still have a good 80lbs to go. I discovered keto a few months ago and recently saw your new keto plan. It's helping a little but still hitting walls. I never had weight issues before or had to get in shape, as I was always in shape, so this is puzzling me. Do you have any tips for people in my unusual situation or different workout variations or styles that work best for this? Or maybe Lynn has experienced this with one of her clients? I'd love to hear your advice on your podcast! I've done fit2fat and now need to get 2fit!"
3106,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Life changing stuff here!,5,"So much more than fitness and looking good. Drew focuses on spiritual, emotion, and finally physically well being. I appreciate the holistic approach. This podcast is changing the way I think about myself and life."

3108,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,So inspirational,5,Love listening to Drew's podcasts. He has such a wealth of knowledge and experience with all things fitness and health. He is very positive and inspiring. Keep up the great podcasts Drew!!
3109,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Relatable and real !!!,5,It's so hard to find trainers you can connect with following Drew/Lynn for years I've learned so many new things that have not only improved my health but my mental health and here we are so many years later and I still continue to learn I have a great deal of gratitude and respect for both and all the knowledgeable guests they've had on can't wait to hear more ‚ù§Ô∏è
3110,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Honest,5,Great honestly and genuine character. It takes a lot of courage to share your story.
3111,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,"Awesome Show, highly recommend!",5,"Lynn, Drew and their guests provide some incredibly compelling content that‚Äôs geared to help you take actionable steps to live a healthier, more well-rounded life.

3113,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Fantastic podcast!,5,At first I was a tad weary of subscribing to this podcast because I thought it would be Keto diet overload. However...it is a wealth of information on so many different topics! From physical health to mental health and they always have fascinating guests each week that I keep taking screen shots of their episode notes so I won‚Äôt forget where to find these individuals! Fabulous! Thank you!
3114,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Thank You,5,"Drew, I want to thank you for your wonderful podcast! I have learned so much in the 10weeks that I converted to Keto. In the 10 weeks I have lost 30lbs and feel so much better. It has definitely been an eye opening experience for. I hope to her more great programming from you."
3115,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Thank-you for this podcast,5,"Drew, I've been listening for 18 months, and I really appreciate who you are as a person, your character, how you treat Lynn and your daughters, and your kindness. Ive lost 42lbs, and really become a devotee of the ketogenic way of life. Ive learned so uch from you, I can't begin to say. You've changed the course of my health and life, my family's, and everyone who asks me how I did it. You're making a huge impact on people !"
3116,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Episode 94 Jessi Fit2Fat2Fit,5,"Just listened to F2F2F Episode 94 with Ryan Lowery. I thought Drew did a great job interviewing Lowery and I thought Lowery was on point with his comments about Exogenous and Endogenous Ketones. I learned a lot from listening.
I do struggle with the company Lowery promotes and works for which is Pruvitt the sellers of Keto//OS. I actually think Keto//OS is a great legit product but I have a huge problem with how they market it and sell it.
If you ever look at the Pruvitt Official FB page IMO it is filled with half truths and even all out lies which confuses and leads people/potential buyers to make mistakes in buying and using their product. If you research Exogenous Ketones you will learn that Exogenous Ketones Do Not Promote Fat or Weight Loss but on Pruvitts page people are made to believe that this is a miracle product for weight loss.
The people claiming that this is a miracle product for weight loss are the same people who are trying to get you to order from them so they can put your money in their bank.
Also when Pruvitt first came to market they sold their product in a 30 package 30 day supply. Now days because of their greed they only sell a 20 day supply for a ridiculous amount of money. The other thing I really dislike is their distributors will tell you they are the only real Exogenous Ketone product and everyone else is counterfeit products which is not true at all.
If your interested in taking EK‚Äôs do yourself a huge favor and Google Exogenous Ketone Products. There are a bunch of other way less expensive products on the market. Perfect Keto and Ketond are just a couple good Ketone products."
3117,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Great information and easy to listen to!,5,"I absolutely loveeeee this podcast! Drew invites a lot of inspirational people that I now follow and continue to learn from them and each episode has QUALITY information that not only fitness fanatics, like myself, can relate to. I've learned so much from listening to these and I just hope he keeps up with this podcast because I'm absolutely addicted! I only wish I can listen to his earlier episodes since iTunes only allow a certain number of episodes on your podcast app and so I've missed out on the first 30."
3118,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Thank You,5,"I‚Äôm an avid listener and became a fan when I saw you on a reality show. I just finished episode 100 and I‚Äôm shocked but in the best way possible. Thank you for sharing, you‚Äôre an inspiration!"

I think Drew does a great job of finding interesting people from a variety of backgrounds to interview. He‚Äôs seems super genuine, and asks great questions. I especially liked the episode where he talked about his story."
3122,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Inflamation question,5,"Drew, if we add carbs to grow muscles, wouldn‚Äôt that also increase the levels of inflammation on the body?"
3123,The Fit2Fat2Fit Experience,Information is widespread,5,Love that the info is widespread and not just one persons views all the time. The breadth of information sparks a lot of things for the everyday listener to research and dig into on their own. Thanks!

3145,The Mike Dolce Show,Love this podcast!,5,"I first purchased Mike Dolce‚Äôs cookbook Living Lean, which I am obsessed with. Then I discovered this podcast. Great interviews, free information, and motivation. Love the ‚Äúget better‚Äù podcast in particular. Really amps me up! Huge fan üëçüëç"
3146,The Mike Dolce Show,üëçüèª,5,ü§òüèªüëçüèª
3147,The Mike Dolce Show,Volume,5,Coach the volume in the podcast is so low anymore I can‚Äôt hardly hear it. Can you look into it. This is the only podcast with this issue.
3148,The Mike Dolce Show,Dolce is the best.,5,Great podcast with great topics and guests. Mike is super knowledgeable
3149,The Mike Dolce Show,Educational & Science Based,5,"Dolce is entertaining & well rounded! He‚Äôs so knowledgeable plus he actually cares about teaching you all he can regarding your health, I‚Äôm so grateful to have found him!
Yo. üá±üá∑"
3150,The Mike Dolce Show,Weirdly motivating & informative,5,Not sure how this guy makes me feel like trash and inspired but he does. This isn‚Äôt some bland concoction of data... no this is a hellfire & brimstone fitness evangelist!! U will learn something!!
3151,The Mike Dolce Show,The man!,5,Dolce is the man!
3152,The Mike Dolce Show,Volume,5,Love the show. But the volume is much lower than other podcasts I listen to. Hard to hear everything unless I‚Äôm right next to speaker of wearing headphones.
3153,The Mike Dolce Show,It Works!,5,"Love, Love, Love the Dolce Diet!"
3154,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Very little content,1,I stuck through 2 episodes of chit chat and fun facts. Waiting and waiting for helpful content. Can‚Äôt give them a 3rd hour of my life.
3155,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,"Informative, but...",3,They get sidetracked A LOT. A third of a podcast could be talking about things totally unrelated.
3156,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,New favorite addiction!,5,"I run @thecavemankitchen and thecavemankitchenblog.com which is solely a Keto back to the basics approach to living. I‚Äôve been on the hunt lately for ALL information on keto and CrossFit, I hit a jackpot with these guys! I have been Keto for 2 years and going to CrossFit for a year. There is such a lack of information about ketogenic diets and CrossFit so I‚Äôve been on my own personal journey and it feels AMAZING to find like minded people who also think this lifestyle is possible!
If you do see this review, I would love to a) be on the podcast one day! ü§ó and b) Any suggestions on things to eat and/or drink before, during and after a wod?
Keep up the great work!"
3157,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Irrelevant subjects.,2,Dude talk about health and wellness or personal development. Not movies. So irrelevant to what I came to this podcast for. Other then that I‚Äôm interested but talking about dumb things makes me want to unsubscribe.
3158,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Too much fluff,2,"I‚Äôm seven minutes in and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. They haven‚Äôt said squat about keto or athletics at this point, it‚Äôs been nothing but trivial garbage like movies and childbirth. Like overhearing a few boring people talking about nothing. Can‚Äôt get into it at all. Some people are talented enough to be engaging while talking about trivial nonsense, but these people certainly are not. Don‚Äôt quit your day jobs!"
3159,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Amazing Podcast,5,"I love the podcast! I‚Äôm 16 and keto and trying to educate myself as much as possible, since they don‚Äôt let you earn an NTP at 16. They tackle everything in being keto, not just the food aspects of it. Keep it up y‚Äôall!"
3160,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Great listen,5,"I love this podcast! It has so much information, both Danny and Brian are so insightful in their information and passionate about their topics. Danny is a great man optimistic, while Brian is real he tells it like it is he is the most relatable person in the cast he‚Äôs just like all of us weather we like to see it he asks the real questions, he thinks just like we all do but we‚Äôre just afraid to voice it with fear of being labeled as ‚Äúweird‚Äù live this cast love it"
3161,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Informative and fun!,5,"I just started doing keto, and I did my research before starting by reading articles and watching goody beats and that how I discovered Danny. From there, I learned about the ketogenic athlete podcast and then I was hooked. I love the the dynamic between Bryan and Danny on this show! Not only are you getting excellent information about keto and the science behind it to help better suit your lifestyle, but your getting topics outside the fitness industry entirely. From talking about music to discussing superheroes, Bryan and Danny keep this podcast fun and educational and they should get two thumbs up üëçüëç."
3162,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Great show!,5,"This podcast is informative and entertaining! Very helpful info always, great guests, and I love the down to earth, fun approach!"
3163,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Great podcast,5,Thank you for commenting on the Ketogains approach. I hate those guys! 5 Stars!
3164,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Waste of time,1,So much nonsense mixed in with the content. 15 minutes at the beginning about superhero movies? If I wanted a podcast about movies I would find one. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
3165,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Hilarious,5,"I‚Äôm laughing so hard at the negative reviews right now, I guess this show‚Äôs not for everyone. I love how hilarious Brian and Danny are, especially because they think conspiracy theories are as amazing as I do. The humor along with content are wonderful to me. Too often I find myself listening to hours of serious podcasts about nutrition and fitness, and this podcast helps me bring levity into my life."
3166,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,The best keto podcast period,5,"The ketogenic athlete podcast is by far the best podcast I have listened to regarding keto. Full of knowledge, humor, and all around good information. Through listening to the podcast and researching their recommendations regarding the ketogenic diet I have been able to get rid of my IBS symptoms and have felt ten times better due to them. Anybody who listens to keto podcasts needs to listen to this one.
-Christian Unger"
3167,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Look forward to this every week,5,"I really enjoy this podcast. The hosts are knowledgeable yet very open to other things and down to earth. They have a hometown Keto feel and approach to hosting in a some times big business generic Keto world.
The people they bring on the show are often off the beaten path of the traditional athletes and therefore bring unique insights that you wouldn‚Äôt get anywhere else.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUYS! They do there thing and don‚Äôt care to much about negative opinions. Love it!"
3168,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,"Great information, great personalities",5,"I have been Keto seriously, for about 2 weeks. I stumbled across this podcast looking for information to help me. I have three books that I am reading as well. While I am only in the first season of the show, I am confident in my decision to go Keto because of you guys. I am an endurance athlete that lost a significant amount of weight the old fashioned way, but didn‚Äôt really go as far as I wanted. After being stalled in my weight loss for about a year, I decided to research new ways. The information that you provide is invaluable and I have directed some of my fitness friends to the podcast. Please keep doing what you are doing."
3169,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Amazing!!,5,"Just started keto a little over a month ago and I actually found these guys through Leanne Vogel‚Äôs podcast, the keto diet podcast, and they are AWESOME!! I was listening at work and busted out laughing more than once. They know what they‚Äôre talking about and they‚Äôre so entertaining. Great show."
3170,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Brian and Danny at the GREATEST hosts ever,5,"Keto For Normies lead me to Danny who lead me to The Ketogenic Athlete and I‚Äôve never looked back. This podcast is a weekly staple for me. I love the banter and fascinating facts, all the haters can just keep hating üí™ You can count me one of you regular 23-ish listeners."
3171,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Great Podcast!!,5,By far my favorite Keto Podcast. I learn soemthing new each episode including to not think of Keto as a diet but a lifestyle.
3172,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Love the banter!!,5,"So after binge listening to every episode this is hands down one of my favorite podcasts!! I don‚Äôt know why people complain about the banter before, its so entertaining!! The information contained in this podcast will help you become a better athlete. Keto on guys!!!"
3173,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,2nd Best Podcast,5,"I love this Podcast, I never miss an episode. It‚Äôs second only to the Ketovangelist Kitchen :-)"
3174,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,‚ÄúMake me a sandwich‚Äù,1,Lost all respect for Danny after he said one of his favorite things to say to his wife is ‚Äúmake me a sandwich‚Äù. Where‚Äôs the respect?
3175,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,The Ketogenic Athlete(s),5,"....Bring it! They‚Äôve got so much info to offer. The content is relatable, informative and entertaining. Brian and Danny make a cool team! They‚Äôre experiences with health make you want to listen get into athletic form!
I suggest not to listen while working out tho, you may drop the weights from laughter.
Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode guys!
Thanks for your time. ~ @ant_ele"
3176,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,"Entertaining, Fun and Informative",5,"This podcast is fantastically entertaining. They have great guests and clearly have a great time doing their thing. I mostly listen for the topics discussed before the interviews or so-called ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of the podcast begins. Love it, keep them coming!"
3177,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Best information!!,5,"Thanks for all the information you give.
It's helping tremendously each day to apply the examples you give!! Love ‚ù§Ô∏è this podcast!!!"
3178,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Love...Love...Love,5,"I‚Äôve been keto for about a month now, but in a lot of the research I did and continue to do, a lot of the popular websites don‚Äôt address working out like these guys do! I love that they talk about running and lifting and how keto works with that. I do half marathons, and this is one of the few good places I‚Äôve found advice and tips for endurance and distance running! Especially when they interview distance runners...my absolute favorite!! I will be telling any and everyone I know who runs or works out to listen to this podcast! Keep it up guys!!"
3179,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Fun and educational,5,Delivers good information in a entertaining way!
3180,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Normal guys with great info,4,"I love that Danny and Brian are just normal guys who use normal language to discuss things related to Keto and athletics. They just do not do surface discussions but go into great and important detail. If you are looking for the HOW TO's for Keto and working out, this is the place."
3181,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Needs timestamps,3,"I can‚Äôt take it anymore. Keto plus athleticism is my ideal combination for a podcast I would want to listen to. But ever since they stopped putting timestamps in the notes, I have no way to easily get past Brian‚Äôs babbling. And the extent to which he cuts off his interviewee is just too much."
3182,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,üòê,5,Brian sounds like a meth head tweaker half the time when he tries to make a joke
3183,The Ketogenic Athlete Podcast,Best podcast in the fitness/nutrition space,5,"This podcast is amazing. Brian and Danny constantly present great content in an engaging and interesting way. They are fountains of knowledge themselves and they bring on very knowledgeable guests. This has been the best resource that I have found for how to maximize your efficiency while strength training, endurance training, or any other type of athletic endeavor through following a ketogenic lifestyle."
3184,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Great podcast,5,"Love to listen to Dave. Have listened for a long time. It‚Äôs nice to hear that someone has the same struggles with working out and eating healthy. Also always has good stats, health info, books and websites. Keep it up Dave! Thank you for sharing!"
3185,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Moth to flame,2,"You mention that when you start thinking about foods, you are drawn to them. Me too!!! So I can‚Äôt listen to you talk for half of your podcast about ice cream, frosties , and blizzards."
3186,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Great lessons on weight and life,5,"I love Dave‚Äôs honesty and relatability. He‚Äôs the kind of guy you‚Äôd want next to you in the trenches because he‚Äôll make you laugh despite the miserable struggle. His podcast not only motivates me to lose weight but his podcast is rich with nuggets about life that have proven very effective. His skinny weight loss jingle is the highlight of my morning commute. True he‚Äôs not always successful at losing but he‚Äôs managed not to gain and has consistently followed s mostly healthy lifestyle, which is impressive. Again I cannot express how much I appreciate is honesty and his willingness to be vulnerable in an effort to help others."
3187,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Love this podcast,5,"Dave is a highly relatable and funny guy and above all he comes across as very honest and highly transparent and trustworthy. It is true that he is moving back and forth on his journey to find his path to fat loss for life, but I prefer this 100x times more than a fake Dave that would just tell me what I would like to hear. I think that what makes his podcast so relatable is that I can find my own struggle in his honest sharing of his own struggles in his personal journey. And he has a very funny way to bring accross his point. I was once paying a monthly subscription for another motivational health podcast that I also liked a lot, but than it turned out that this guy was not telling the complete truth about his own journey and progress, but was only recording what he thought that his subscribers wanted to hear. Eventually I guess he was getting into this conflict of interest and he was sharing only worthless nothings and fillers up until people starting seeing through and cancelling their membership and the show was cancelled a few years ago. I would rather pay Dave 2x more very gladly, to support his show, which I am actually doing to a certain extent as a patronizer, than give this other podcaster even 1 dollar for his fake podcasts. Did I mentioned that Dave is very funny? Dave keep it up. I will continue frantically check my podcast app weekly to see if you have any new honest and truthfull motivational podcasts for me to listen to while I am doing my exercises on my journey to find my own fat loss path and beat my own struggles with my overweight. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
3188,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,This motivates me,5,I‚Äôm down 90 lbs since July and your podcast helps me. Thank you!
3189,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,I really like listening BUT,4,"It‚Äôs depressing how much he bounces back and forth with his weight and seems to constantly make excuses as to why he keeps gaining weight despite the podcast before he talks about making better decisions or something similar. The guy is very relatable and I enjoy listening but it seems like he doesn‚Äôt really want to lose weight. Also it seems like he is just advertising atomic habits the last several episodes and not really giving any other kinds of advice.
UPDATE: I think it‚Äôs really cool you read my review and addressed all of my points. I admit I might‚Äôve been a little harsh as I struggle with many of the things you do and am most likely projecting on you. I do appreciate all the advice you give and I will keep listening as I try to change my own habits. Best of luck and thank you for being so open and honest about your life."
3190,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,I like this podcast,5,Been listening for several years and really enjoy Dave. He is down to earth and I appreciate the fact that his issues are similar to my own
3191,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Nothing but advertising for dubious products,1,Title says it all
3192,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Nice voice,3,I don't get into the tech so much but always good to listen to someone else struggling and accomplishing wright loss goals
3193,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,As a Health and Wellness Coach,5,"Dave, as a Health and Wellness Coach.... I really enjoy listening to your show!! This is a no Nonsense show hitting issue's that everyone needs to hear!
Thom"
3194,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Awesome!!!,5,So glad I found this podcast. It's just what I needed.
3195,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,good podcast,5,really enjoy the podcast just wish it was more frequent
3196,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Need more,5,"Really enjoy your podcast! So real!! I'm like the rest of your ""fans"" just wish it was more often, your like just having a buddy going through the same thing with the ups and downs of real life! Do not leave us! And hope your wife is doing well after her surgery!"
3197,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Get with It,4,"David, I really like listening to your Podcast which motivate me, but come on, you've been doing this for three years, and you're at an all time high for weight. Let's get it going in the right direction."
3198,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,The King of Excuses,3,"I really want to like this podcast, but I find that week after week it's the same thing: a list of excuses as to why the podcaster either gained or didn't lose weight. And rarely is anything entirely his fault. Sigh ..."
3199,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,This show helped me a lot,5,I really really like this show! I like the gadget tips and the fact that David Jackson goes though the same struggles as everyone else. I am looking forward to more podcasts. Keep it up!
3200,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Where,1,"I like the guy - he seems like a really good person. However, for the entire time I've been listening to his podcasts, he has puttered around with about a 10 lb. range - this over 2 years or so. He is addicted to Mountain Dew and the entire gist of his shows is to review some web based food and exercise tracking systems or fitness ""aids"" or iPhone apps. The bottom line is, I need somebody that motivates me by example. Dave seems to be doing this podcast just to listen to himself talk. If that is the purpose of the podcast, I think there are plenty of others that have moved past the ""eat less exercise more"" mentality. And the difference between them and Dave is, their approaches actually work.
I need a podcast that gives me REAL guidance for losing, and not someone going on and on about the fit bit or body media / body bug. Inspire me by actually using LOGIC, not gimmicks. And, inspire me by actually losing weight. If the eat less exercise more model works, why are you not losing weight? Eat healthier foods, not Mountain Dew and McDonalds. The body needs nutrients, not to be tricked by processed foods that you scan the barcode with some b/s ap on your iPhone. Quit buying into paid websites, apps, fitness gurus who want to sell you plans or supplements, and do your research.
I hope the best for you, but what you are doing is not working - for you or for me."
3201,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,My favorite Podcast,5,"This is such a comforting podcast. The world needs David Jackson. I listen to him because he is going through similar challenges around weight loss and he learns right in front of us. He's a regular person whose podcasts sit with me for years after he produces them because he's doesn't pretend to be a guru, he's himself. When i am feeling lonely and need a friend, this is the podcast I turn to every time. btw, Great information about new weight loss gadgets!"
3202,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Would you like some pity in your party,2,So let me get this straight. There is a premium group that costs money to join. Putting it gingerly the host beats him self up and whines about lack of weight loss for good portion of the show. So if you are looking for otivation keep moving to another podcast.
3203,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Great tips!,5,"I found this podcast not very long ago and have really enjoyed listening while I'm walking, mowing the lawn, or driving. I find Dave to be very motivating and entertaining. Your tips are helpful and you have been motivating me to dust off my Fitbit and get those 10,000 steps in each day. Thanks!"
3204,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Inspirational,5,I like Dave. I find him inspirational and interesting. The fact he struggles with his weight makes him more like the rest of us. If your listening to his podcast it's obvious you have had issues with weight. I know I have had. I like his anecdotes and stories he finds on the Internet. Keep up the good work!
3205,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Oh boy. . .,1,"I began listening to the podcast in 2014, because I wanted to change things. But I find that Dave is still stuck in that same yo-yo dieting phase. I subscribed because I wanted to have motivation and be inspired about losing weight. Instead I‚Äôm listening to a guy who hasn‚Äôt conquered his Mountain Dew demon and dogs others on weight loss surgery. I‚Äôm not a fan of weight loss surgery but the last 2 podcast that I listened to mentioned the diet shake that he‚Äôs doing as well how his friend was going to fail because she was going to do weight loss surgery. He was negative about it but didn‚Äôt mention any positives to motivate her or be empathic to her. So no, I can‚Äôt listen anymore because he‚Äôs Oscar the grouch in human form."
3206,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Horrible....,1,"It's worst than listening to a whiny little girl. What a complainer, can't stand his voice and constant interruptions. Maybe that had something to do with losing sponsorship from Amazon."
3207,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,I like it a lot,5,"This podcast is not for everyone, but it sure is for me! If you are looking for a Biggest Loser get-thin-quick solution, this isn't what you're looking for. If you are looking for a ""here's how I lost 100 pounds,"" this isn't what you're looking for.
However, if you struggle with your weight, here is a real guy talking to himself about his journey and sharing his thoughts with you. I've listened for several years. Dave is up front about his challenges - what is working and what isn't. I've battled the same 15 pounds for two decades, and am grateful to know I'm not alone. It is good to have the reminder that a ""backslide on the backside"" isn't a failure of me as a person. I like hearing about new gadgets he is trying, or new recipes, or new foods. Sometimes I try them myself, and usually I don't. But I like hearing about them.
I'm sad for Dave that he hasn't resolved his weight issue for good. Guess what - many of us are in the same boat. We all have reasons why we aren't slender. I suspect that slender people aren't the ones who tune into a podcast like this. This dude battles those demons in a very public manner, and helps me battle mine!
This podcast is FREE. Like a lot of podcasts, Dave relies on small commissions from Amazon and other vendors to help defray the costs of production. He is up-front and honest about that. There are many, many products he discusses on the podcast for which he receives no endorsement and purchases with his own cash. If he then says ""you can buy that on Amazon, and I appreciate it if you click through the link at my site"" I am totally OK with that.
Give it a try for several weeks in a row. Each week is different, and there isn't a formula. If you don't like it this week, you just might love it next time!"
3208,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Like listening to a friend,5,"I've been listening to this podcast for years and I wanted to leave a review based on my experience: Dave is very very relatable an I think that is why I can always go back and re-listen to episodes, or hear new ones and feel comforted and inspired.
The episodes are timeless because he's not chasing the newest craze, or giving you the latest ""Dr. Phil"" advice.
What I like most about Dave is that he's just like me, he's a normal person who struggles, has moments of weakness and in the end is optimistic of the future.
The advice he gives is solid, the reviews of new tech come from a normal perspective and not from a salesman, and in the end I think his take away message is that it's about living a healthy lifestyle, not following the newest fad or trying the lose weight the quickest way possible.
The production quality is (almost) always good, (when he goes for walks with his recorder it does have its charm although sometimes hard to listen to.)
When his scale is down I feel triumphant with him, and when his is up I feel motivated by his future plans and positive attitude.
To end this long winded review I would like to thank Dave for continuing this podcast and never giving up, in the end that is my favorite part, how inspiring not giving up can truly be."
3209,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Thanks Dave!,5,"For letting us in on your conversation with yourself throughout this journey! ""Whiney little girl eh?"" No one is forcing that listener to listen! Even when you are critical or negative it is for a positive reason! ""You can do this!""
Thanks Dave!"
3210,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Are you reading my mind?,5,"I really like this podcast. There are lots of podcasts out there who have already lost all their weight, and now they're trying to tell us how to do it. So if you don't know what you need to do to lose weight, you might prefer one of those. But the reality is that most of us already know HOW to do it, we just lack the motivation needed to do it. Dave is right in the middle of the same struggle that I am, so I really relate to him -- including his issues with Mountain Dew and his constant struggle with staying on track. That's me, except with more of a sweet tooth problem than a craving for Mountain Dew. :) Dave is just a regular guy trying to lose a few pounds while dealing with all the normal stresses of life, and that's someone I can relate to and want to hear from. Keep up the good work, Dave!"
3211,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,I want to like this show but...,3,"Dave tries. He really does. And on the surface, the stuff he says makes sense. Move more. Eat less.
But it‚Äôs all SO gimmicky. He plays around with apps and programs but never seems to get anywhere. And when he finally does have progress, he acts like it‚Äôs just common sense and everyone should know what to do and how to do it. Duh! The latest being his fascination with Slimgenics. From his description, this does not sound like a program that could be sustainable, but it does sound like a starting point. And I certainly wish Dave the best with this program.
For real mindset change, I highly recommend Half Size Me and also Lift Like a Gift. The hosts talk about loving who you are NOW while changing your mindset to ultimately achieve your best self. You will pick up tips, but they won‚Äôt be the little lists like Dave sometimes shares from an article.
I‚Äôll keep listening because I am a podcast junkie (and I do produce 2 shows before Dave dismisses me completely‚Ä¶and not the ones I mentioned above.) And the sound quality is usually quite good. Not easy to pull off. I do hate the intro music because I think only wanting to be thin is a poor goal. I want so much more for myself, but that‚Äôs just me. So I listen for the entertainment, but I do not expect to learn or be inspired."
3212,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Love this podcast,5,"I have listened to this podcast for several years. I absolutely love it. Why? Because Dave is perfect? Because Dave has all the answers? Nope, because Dave is like me and he is honest about his struggles. While I am totally rooting for his success, I know that some day he will get there and this podcast will end. I will feel like I lost a best friend. However, while he is still here, I am a faithful listener."
3213,Logical Weight Loss Podcast,Just a regular guy,5,"That's what I relate to Dave most with this podcast. He's just you're regular guy. Things happen, his weight goes up, life goes on. You just gotta pick yourself back up & get back to eating right & exercising. This podcast has helped inspire me & over the course of several years I've lost 75 pounds. I was well over 400 pounds & I still have a ways to go. And I've been able to encourage others, like my mom who's lost around 100 now. Keep up the great work & just know you are inspiring people."
3214,Align Podcast,Calm & Informative,5,Aaron has a calm forthright deliverance making this a very enjoyable addition to my health and wellness collection. His guests offer unique takeaways and there is always good synergy between them.

The conversations are genuinely interesting and more often than not I see the world a little bit differently. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of intellectual stimulation without almost no pretense. Keep up the great work!!!
3218,Align Podcast,Perfectly Aligned,5,"Mr. Aaron Alexander‚Äôs podcast is an artful mixture of everything that will tickle your human essence: psychedelics and spirituality, body balance and health, psychology and brain optimization, philosophical and cultural musings, and nerdy jokes. Aaron‚Äôs brilliance attracts some fabulous company, making for conversations that are truly life-changing and perspective-flipping. I often pause the show and take notes: the content is just that delicious. Thank you Aaron for being vulnerable and curious, and for sharing this space with the world - it is so lovely to receive."
3219,Align Podcast,This is my favorite podcast in the world,5,"Hey I think it would be a really great idea for you to meet Paul Chek
Nevermind I found it ü§Øü§Øü§Øüò≥üò≥üò≥

Very very very deep Paul Chek is amazing"
3220,Align Podcast,"More, please",5,We would love to hear you 5 times a week!?
3221,Align Podcast,G.O.A.T,5,"I constantly refresh my screen each week waiting for this podcast to pop up! Aaron is so down to earth, open minded and intelligent. I genuinely love every episode and always take away something new each week. Thank you Aaron ‚ù§Ô∏è much love"
3222,Align Podcast,Savage,5,"Open minded man showing us the big picture. I Appreciate your work so much, it inspires me to keep opening up and refining my own approach."
3223,Align Podcast,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Aaron, host of the Align Podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
3224,Align Podcast,New found energy!,5,"I found Aaron on Alexi Panos podcast Unleashed. The next day I binged on a few. Episode 237 and 247, completely different and still the same. This podcast has such intriguing guests. The honesty shared in these episodes is so vulnerable and real! You laugh, you take notes, you share! Whether you are ready to learn new integrative ways to a healthier existence or not, listening to Aaron and his topics you are open to trying it all!"
3225,Align Podcast,Best podcast for mind body work!,5,"I recently found the Align podcast through an episode Aaron did on the Model Health Show and I cannot get enough! I‚Äôve been going back and listening to past episodes and am amazed at all of the content that is covered. I‚Äôve spent the past 10+ years healing physiological challenges meeting with doctors and specialists, studying the spine, fascia, emotional trauma and more and Aaron beautifully sums up all of what I‚Äôve learned and more!! He does an amazing job at normalizing the human experiences we all have, talking about how it all works, and even connects the audience to wonderful resources. I‚Äôm so glad this content is readily available for anyone to have it, it‚Äôs so necessary! Thank you Aaron for shining your light and inspiring us to live better in our bodies!"
3226,Align Podcast,Aaron is Peter Pan with a PHD,5,"He has many guests you may have heard before but not like you‚Äôve ever heard them before! Maybe it‚Äôs the forced ice baths and recording in the sauna that allows them to open up and dig deeper into their personal experiences and knowledge? Maybe it‚Äôs his playful relaxed nature? All of the above and more!! This podcast always leaves me with a smile on my face, feeling revived, motivated, and hopefully a little more knowledgeable. ü§©üôåüèº‚ú®#powerfulemojis #thumbinthebutt"
3227,Align Podcast,Amazing !,5,"Very nice information. Very accurate, relatable, down to earth, and honest. Thank you!!!"
3228,Align Podcast,This Podcast is THE BOMB,5,All humans will benefit for listening to this podcast! It is full of easy to implement techniques to greatly improve your life. I love the different gusts that Aaron hosts and interesting conversations they have. I also really enjoy hearing about the research that backs up all that interesting information. üíûüíûüíû
3229,Align Podcast,Like being there in the sauna,5,"Aaron‚Äôs style and demeanor is so audience inclusive it makes me feel like I‚Äôm hanging out with him and the guests. Totally conversational, non-scripted, let‚Äôs see where it goes kind of dialogue that builds relationship between everyone involved and attaches deeper meaning to what is said. You are well read and curious, definitely someone I‚Äôd want as a friend. You‚Äôve also turned me on to some people I‚Äôd never have heard of who are asking big questions with humility. Very cool - sharing your podcast with family and friends!"
3230,Align Podcast,Health You,5,Your interview with Jack Kruse was fascinating! I‚Äôve heard him before and always pick up something new. You seem so sincere and genuine with your responses also.
3231,Align Podcast,Personal and Professional,5,"What‚Äôs up Aaron! Just wanted to give you a shoutout for how much you‚Äôve helped both in my personal and professional life journey. I am an Occupational Therapist and I work in inpatient psychiatry. An an OT we look at how people‚Äôs daily habits, routines, and lifestyles impact their mental health. Essentially how are you ‚Äúoccupying‚Äù yourself and how does the way you engage in those impacts impact your well being. So not only have I implemented you're techniques and strategies for myself but I take the information you share and bring it to my patients to help teach them about how body position, movement, and sensory input impacts their emotional well-being. I love the way you break down and present the information in a tangible well. Appreciate you brother! Much love."
3232,Align Podcast,Brilliant!,5,"I just laughed my way through the JP Sears episode. What a brilliant, insightful, hilarious podcast. Totally worth every minute!"
3233,Align Podcast,Align your life,5,"Look forward to Align podcast weekly! Aaron always has really interesting guests, and conversations that you can gain value from! And he does all his sessions in a sauna!"
3234,Align Podcast,Great podcast!,5,I just started listening to your podcast and I am loving it. One podcast gave me an idea about how to help a client (I am a health coach) and another was a help to me and my family. The night after listening to the podcast with Ben Greenfield I made a point of making eye contact with my two children as I tucked them into bed. Both reached out to touch my face (before I did) and they were such sweet moments of connection it will be something that I implement nightly from now on! More connection for 2020!
3235,Align Podcast,A must listen for challenging your perspectives and ego,5,"I was essentially forced into hearing Aaron by way of my wife tuning in and taking over the house with her phone in ‚Äúbinge mode‚Äù of the Align Podcast. As soon as I took in the words, I was deeply uncomfortable and defensive on many levels. To the point where I‚Äôd allow my mood to shift into a negative place as soon as I‚Äôd hear Bruce Lee‚Äôs voice from the intro. And then, I did something that I‚Äôve been actively working on for the better part of 3 years.
I took control of my experience and thought, ‚ÄúWait a minute. I like Bruce Lee‚Äôs ‚Äòwater‚Äô adaptation. And I freaking love the character Rocky. I bet I could get down with the discomfort and dive into what Aaron has to say. ‚ÄòCause he seems like a person I‚Äôd have a great conversation with if I met him out in the world.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I chose to listen rather than hear.
If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs looking to grow in many facets, on sensitive and challenging topics... then Aaron‚Äôs Align podcast is a great breeding ground for thought provoking, emotionally stimulating subjects that will help you on your journey of ever progressing enlightenment.
Keep on keeping on,
Jess R."
3236,Align Podcast,ANNOYING AF,2,"The guests are great and have a lot of valuable information.
That‚Äôs it.
In order to listen, I have had to adjust the playback speed to 2x, program my settings to skip the first and last five minutes where the hosts rambles, and fast forward any time he begins to speak. This is because his cartoon voices are absolutely obnoxious and they literally (and goddammit, I mean literally) make me want to punch somebody in the face.
After listening to several episodes, I had to unsubscribe. There are so many better podcast hosts who don‚Äôt act like 9-year old boys. Many of them I found through his show, so there‚Äôs that."
3237,Align Podcast,Thanks for Running to Greece with Me,5,"Align podcast has been my constant companion as I train for the Athens marathon in Greece. I didn‚Äôt even like podcasts‚ÄîI had previously thought of them as monotone radio shows. Until Aaron!
His charisma and enthusiasm led me up hill workouts, his inquiries and guidance intrigued me at eighteen miles when it felt like I‚Äôd never make it home, and his genuinely cheerful laughter made me smile when I thought I had no more gas in the tank.
So I urge you, if you want to be part of a conversation that matters, work on a little brain bending, or simply miss people talking with passion Align Podcast is for you!
Thank you for doing what you do Aaron, love and light,
Kay"
3238,Align Podcast,Great podcast,5,"Love the eclectic array of guests and topics , appreciate the curiosity, depth , and light hearted ness of every episode."
3239,Align Podcast,A worthwhile podcast!!,5,"Aaron‚Äôs a smart, funny guy and he‚Äôs a ball to listen to. His guests are all top tier and every show loaded with valuable insights and useful tips! A++!!"
3240,Align Podcast,Hilarious & thought provoking,5,"I'm a new subscriber and I love this guy! I first heard him on a Sex with Emily podcast and had to look him up. Glad I did. He's freakin hilarious and at the same time real deep! Very interesting topics and guests. His voice is really smooth. I really like his candid vulnerability too, it's comforting. Learning lots plus giving me tons of food for thought."
3241,Align Podcast,"Insightful, helpful and interesting conversations",5,"Thank you for everything that you do. This podcast has really helped open my mind. Also, your tips on better movement practices has helped ease my pain and given me a better, happier life. Thanks again!"
3242,Align Podcast,Just awesome!!,5,Aaron‚Äôs podcast is so great! I feel he just comes across as truly authentic and honest and does so with a sense of humor. I just listened to the episode with Emily Schromm and it was so great! Keep doing what you do Aaron and just being you!
3243,Align Podcast,Inspired,5,Hands down my fav podcast. Have been listening for a couple years now. Aaron has an amazing line up of guests and I really appreciate how open and vulnerable he and his guests are with the audience. I've picked up a lot of useful tips and continue to learn how to be more aligned and in tune with my body. Thanks brother
3244,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,So Glad You‚Äôre Back!!!,5,Loved hearing about your journeys this past year. And very happy you‚Äôre back!
3245,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,It‚Äôs beyond health information,5,"First time ever writing a review from a podcast health nut junkie...These two take health information and turn it into a portal to your soul. You know, that place we all keep reaching for because we only have one amazing life (in this body). Our journey is taken to the next level with Pillar and Dallas as guides. Gratitude beyond what I can express in words. Congratulations to both of you and thank you for staying in the game. Peace"
3246,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,"Intelligent, engaging, articulate",5,"So happy to see a new episode light up in my feed! Pilar and Dallas host what I think is the most intelligent, engaging, and articulate health and wellness podcast out there. Their conversations are always on point with a rhythmic flow‚Äîno rambling or repeating information‚Äîthese two are masterful speakers with important information to share. This podcast is like Experience Life magazine in audio form‚Äîwell researched topics with just enough color and humor interspersed to make for an entertaining and educational listen. If I had to cull my health and wellness podcast queue down to just one show, this would be it. Welcome back!"
3247,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,My favorite podcast!,5,I love how much relevant info this podcast provides. I have learned so much and have really changed some mindsets because of the info. I love the experiments.
3248,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Eyes Opened,5,This podcast is so wonderful! Love listening to like minded people on a journey for whole health.
3249,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,"If you base your knowledge in anecdotes, this podcast is for you",1,"These two throw a veil of factuality on each topic they discuss, and rely on anecdotes to affirm their own opinions. In one episode, one of them actually says ‚Äútalking to people is the best research I can do.‚Äù When speaking empirically and factually, there is no worse form of research to rely on. These two take on topics like suicide, mental illness, and environmental issues, and back what they say with stories from their friends and what they‚Äôve seen experientially. How can you disseminate such vital information in such irresponsible ways? I guess a non-critical audience that‚Äôs susceptible to it helps. They don‚Äôt cite research despite framing what they say as research-based. Why listen to this when there are amazing podcasts that directly cite articles, leading experts, and often bring in field-innovating researchers? Trust two bloggers/journalists using non-fact, or...people who actually know what they‚Äôre talking about? This podcast perpetuates passive thinking and learning and doesn‚Äôt facilitate conversations which lead to change socially or politically. They use DR. SEUSS to back their ideas on environmentalism. Exactly."
3250,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Brilliance at its best!,5,"I have been a follower of the Podcast since the first season after completing a search of Dallas Hartwig‚Äôs work. I was in a quest to dig deeper into the Whole 30 program. I did not know then that I would be taken to a new and more revealing level of his personality. A person needs some layers, right? I could not be more blessed by the podcast. Pilar and Dallas have a way of talking about exactly what I am going through in each podcast. The podcast allows a space in my life wherein I can dig deeper into relationships with friends, my love, and myself, in a way that corresponds with the beat of my heart! Thanks for the podcast. I recommend The Living Experiment to all my friends."
3251,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Inspiring and Fun Wellness Podcast,5,"I absolutely love this podcast! I came across it recently after seeing it in a list of Dr. Mark Hyman‚Äôs favorite podcasts, and I‚Äôm so happy I did! Pilar and Dallas have really fascinating in-depth conversations on a variety of health, wellness, diet and lifestyle topics. They end each episode with practical recommendations for how we can make improvements in our own lives. I look forward to new episodes!"
3252,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Fabulous conversation!,5,"Now this is what real, intelligent conversation sounds like and, in this crazy world, that‚Äôs hard to come by. Even on the radio or TV, people are always arguing and talking over one another. The special friendship and respect between Dallas and Pilar comes through during every episode. Excellent topics and awesome experiments. I can‚Äôt get enough of The Living Experiment!"
3253,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,I‚Äôm a healthy deviant,5,"My name is Cheryl, and I‚Äôm a scientist, a yogi, and a healthy deviant. This podcast provides me with a sounding board to remind myself of the best version of myself. The information and insights Pilar and Dallas share address the minor and major dilemmas of our time. I talk about the podcast so much people assume Pilar and Dallas are personal friends of mine!"
3254,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Relevant and nourishing topics,5,"I found this podcast a few months ago via Experience Life magazine. The topics are relevant to someone working to live a healthy, active and balanced life. I take something practical away most episodes to incorporate into my life or just something to think about to expand possiblities for myself. This is the type of podcast that I am willing to make time to listen to."
3255,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Brilliant and thought provoking!,5,Pilar & Dallas's collaboration on this podcast is nothing less than brilliant! Their conversational approach to discussing each week's topic on strategies and ideas for improving your quality of life makes them so real. Both Pilar and Dallas are humble and authentic while sharing their unique experiences and knowledge around healthy living and behavior change. I love the way they end each episode with an experiment that the listener is invited to try. I recommend certain episodes to my health coaching clients.
3256,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Love you both!!,5,"Hi Dallas and Pilar! Wow, I don't know where to start, you both are great! I have been an avid listener to your podcast since the first episode. To begin with, I did my first Whole30 back in September 2016, and it was the best decision of my life.. I learned so much and felt amazing!! Like I said I have been listening for awhile and I am always trying to better myself and listen for tips that you both share that I can apply in my life. So amazing, you guys are fun and entertaining to listen too. But I am trying to get a loved one to understand the benefits of being healthy. He isn't really believing me. I have talked to him about Whole30 and the benefits of diet and exercise and he just wont do it. He claims he knows but will not take action. How can I get him started? He is unhealthy and getting more unhealthy day by day. I don't understand how hard it is to just do it. Any suggestions? Thanks for everything, you both rock! :)"
3257,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Authentic,5,Thank you Pilar and Dallas! I love the topics you cover. Sometimes I listen more than once. You always give me something new to think about- you message and your content is authentic and real. It's a really unique podcast.
3258,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Standout!,5,"Don't follow the crowd, be a freak, listen to this podcast! The hosts are trying to change the world by going against the grain and educating people about what's real in the world of health and wellness. They achieve this by sharing the latest proven data and reputable studies about all things related to being a better and more health conscious person. I can't thank the hosts enough for all they are doing to raise awareness in the world."
3259,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Holistic Integrated take on Health and Life,5,"I can't say enough good things about this podcast. It adds a lot of value to my life. I love hearing what Dallas and Pilar have to say about the topics they tackle and what experiments they recommend. They are skeptical of traditional health media and approach topics thoughtfully with the goal of looking at the whole, instead of a flashy, convienent slice of a topic. It is a wonderfully refreshing approach!"
3260,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Look forward to each episode!!,5,"Love this podcast! Looked forward to my Experience Life magazines especially the ""letter from editor"" bc Pilar had so much experience and knowledge to share! Read ""It starts with Food"" and loved the science behind the ""whole 30 program"" and it has been life changing! When this podcast was announced it was an obvious decision to subscribe. I look forward to each weekly episode and always take something away from it! Thank you both! Keep up the great work! I have to mention that you complement each other so nicely on the podcast-great balance of energy, attitude, insight and knowledge(both science and practical)."
3261,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Ideas to Thrive,5,"Love the holistic twist to ideas on living a healthy, vibrant life."
3262,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Needs Work,2,"I really, really want to like this podcast. I so enjoy Pilar's posts about beauty everywhere and sensible health. I also value her work with Experience Life and Revolutionary Acts. But I must agree with another reviewer, I completely tune out when Dallas is talking on this podcast. The new age drivel that comes out of his mouth is just painful. He needs someone outside his circle to give him some objective feedback.
While I offer kudos on his success, the vast majority of listeners are not folks that can fly across countries to do a digital detox or take week-long retreat classes costing thousands of dollars.
For someone trying to portray himself as so in tune with women and other people's struggles in their daily lives, he's vastly out of touch."
3263,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Inspired,4,Hands down my favorite podcast! It's changed my life. I quit my 50hour+ week job and started my own business. I've started focusing more on my health and wellness. I listen to these podcast multiple times. I love the challenging and deep discussion around real issues facing folks that are trying to live a good life. I love Pilars voice. It's very calming and soothing. I also love how they give you 'experiments' to put thoughts into action. This is the Game of Thrones of podcast. Thanks for the works!
3264,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,I learn so much from this podcast!!!!,5,So worthwhile!
3265,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,One of my favorites,5,Dallas and Pilar's discussions are thoughtful and informative. I really enjoy listening to each author's reasoning process. I always look forward to the next installment & also look forward to their next written projects.
3266,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Overall health is just what we all need,5,Just discovered this pod a few weeks ago. My soul has been hungry & I recently shifted my health focus on mental/soul health & Dallas & Pilar have been so helpful.
3267,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,My favorite podcast!,5,"I am a whole30er. I stumbled upon this podcast through Dallas Hartwig‚Äôs website, and wow I am so glad I did. I just started listening a couple months ago, and I have listened to almost 30 of the podcasts (in order). I‚Äôm totally hooked. It has opened up my mind to so many new fields of study and ways of thinking. These two are seriously some of the smartest people I‚Äôve come across in the health and wellness community. The show notes link to additional resources on the topic discussed, which I love! The podcast also inspired me to subscribe to the Experience Life magazine, which I am now thrilled to get every month! So refreshing to hear real talk about real issues people are facing in today‚Äôs world. Subscribe! This is life changing stuff. Can‚Äôt wait for Pilar‚Äôs new book!"
3268,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,I always learn something. . .,5,No matter the topic I always learn something....about myself and others! So good!
3269,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Wonderful Podcast!,5,This podcast is great and full of helpful information! I‚Äôve binge listened to the first 20ish episodes and I‚Äôve learned so much. Thank you for creating this podcast!
3270,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Incredible and challenging,5,"Pilar Gerasimo and Dallas Hartwig drop an incredible amount of information in each episode. Their style is conversational and approachable, and the topics are timely and applicable. Each experiment helps me bring a bit more health into an unhealthy world and helps me focus on being the best human I can be. Highly recommend!"
3271,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,"Practical, Inspiring, and Hopeful",5,"I've been listening for a year now and am consistently blown away with their insight and perspective. It's a really wonderful source of inspiration in both my everyday life (sleep habits, self-talk, etc) and thought-provoking on a wide range of global and external topics (mansplaining, Seasons, etc.)"
3272,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Life-changing,5,"So insightful and thought-provoking! I have really appreciated and benefited from their discussions about health and how modern life is mismatched with much of our biology, and all the practical tips around dealing with it- breaks and seasons were some of my favorites. I found it through Experience Life magazine and am so happy I did!"
3273,The Living Experiment: Rethink Your Choices. Reclaim Your Life.,Judgment Episode brilliant,5,"Thank you for sharing and spreading so much good stuff!
Every new episode has sterling nuggets of wisdom presented through interesting conversations- both hosts are very appealing personalities."
3274,The JuggLife,Best podcast I‚Äôve heard in ages,5,"This podcast is 10% uncomfortable bromance, 10% silliness, 80% of the best free information for athletes. I‚Äôve listened to tons of powerlifting and powerbuilding podcast shows but nobody gives you science based practical advice like these two weirdos. I love it. Guaranteed to put 10% on your total after just one listen. Keep it up"
3275,The JuggLife,One of the best podcasts,5,It is rare to get two very well spoken dudes who know what they are talking about and don‚Äôt make it feel like a lecture. Being someone who loves Jiu-Jitsu and powerlifting it‚Äôs awesome to have a resource like this! Thanks for the great content I hope to be able to work with you one day Chad! Oss!!!!!
3276,The JuggLife,Wealth of information,5,"These episodes aren't long enough, I have referred people to listen to certain episodes with suggestions on injury rehab ect multiple times.
Pretty sure Chad and Max hold hands for the entirety of each episode, not sure."
3277,The JuggLife,Thank you!,5,"As a new lifter your podcasts and YouTube videos have initiated me into the wonderful world of powerlifting. The content is understandable, timely, intelligent, and might I say, hilarious. Thank you for improving my lifts and making my days on the road more enjoyable. I don‚Äôt know how I survived before ‚ÄúHeavy Ducks‚Äù!"
3278,The JuggLife,The Pinnacle of Strength Knowledge,5,Chad and Max have unparalleled sports and strength knowledge and convey it while still being hilarious. Wish they posted more often but it‚Äôs okay.
3279,The JuggLife,Magnanimously funny,5,"Have listened to every episode, and have even listened to some more than once. These episodes are knowledge packed and always displayed in an entertaining, user-friendly way. Can‚Äôt wait for more episodes!"
3280,The JuggLife,Best WL podcast,5,"Jerks with perks, it‚Äôs a lifestyle."
3281,The JuggLife,Communism will have to wait,5,"If you had to choose between listening to the Jugglife podcast and vanquishing communism while simultaneously petting a puppy, which episode would you listen to? The Jugglife podcast has the perfect blend of world class information, top notch guests and cooks antics which makes it one of the best in the game!"
3282,The JuggLife,Thumbs up!,5,Listening to the podcast will increase your total. Very informative and entertaining content.
3283,The JuggLife,Luvs it,5,Chadley‚Äôs velvet voice and dreamy eyes almost put me to sleep on a drive home
3284,The JuggLife,Truth!,5,Content is awesome and love the beers with Chad! 100% truth! Jugg Life all day!
3285,The JuggLife,Best podcast ever,5,"Max and Chad are a wealth of knowledge and a wealth of movie references (if that‚Äôs your thing). They are both huge influences in my strength training and Max has even influenced me to transition from powerlifting to weightlifting. In the words of Joe Dirt, ‚Äúkeep on keepin on!‚Äù"
3286,The JuggLife,üëå,5,"My favorite podcast, I start the car, and the car starts this series. üëçüëç"
3287,The JuggLife,Hilarious and informative,5,My favorite podcast to listen to. Most podcasts sound like a college lecture but this one is like sitting in the gym talking to your buddies about training. Chad and Max are a great combo that deliver knowledge and humor.
3288,The JuggLife,Absolute must listen to,5,"If you have even a passing interest in strength training, strength sports, or glorious beards, The JuggLife is a must listen to podcast. The dynamic duo of CWS and the Montana Miracle Man break down strength training principles to give the listener a better understanding of the fundamentals of getting better in the gym, without any of the BroScience BS. In all seriousness, if every new lifter (regardless of their goals) sat down and listened to a few episodes of The JuggLife they would benefit enormously. I sure wish I had found this gold mine of information and entertainment earlier. I highly enjoy everything you guys put out. Keep making the world a stronger place!"
3289,The JuggLife,A Dream Come True,5,"If you're a grown adult with a job you can't spend your entire day looking at CWS, but fortunately The Jugglife Podcast is a suitable replacement. It's honestly full of so much good information and interesting interviews. I get excited when I see a new episode released. Listen, learn, and fall in love."
3290,The JuggLife,Great lifting podcast,5,"Love these guys. Funny, informative and inspirational"
3291,The JuggLife,Almost like women are people are people! üòÄ,5,"These guys are funny and knowledgeable about powerlifting and weightlifting technique, programming, and news. More remarkably, it‚Äôs almost like women are people to them. Most of the time I try to educate myself on these subjects, I have to take it with the knowledge that the author has discounted women as lifters, and so what they‚Äôre saying may not apply. Max and Chad‚Äôs obvious pride in their female athletes, their true fandom of other female lifters, and their genuine interest in the women‚Äôs divisions are refreshing. They don‚Äôt patronize and rarely have ‚Äúvery special episodes.‚Äù They just act like it‚Äôs a given that women are a legitimate part of these sports. Thank you both!"
3292,The JuggLife,Chad(dy)‚Äôs not my daddy?!,5,"As a mama to a one year old, I am always looking for motivation and inspiration when it comes to lifting after a long day of mom-ing. This podcast is it!! When I have to drive the little guy around until he falls asleep, this is my go-to to keep me awake too. They‚Äôre funny and sarcastic and super knowledgeable; the only issue I‚Äôve got is that when I turn it on my son starts asking dada? dada? And I have to tell him that no, Chad isn‚Äôt your dad. (Sorry kid)
LOVE IT GUYS! Keep up the good content!"
3293,The JuggLife,"Squats, steel, and sex appeal...",5,"Are you tired of the same old boring podcast arguing over high bar V low bar, no hook no feet snatches, and god knows what other senseless bickering?
Well you won‚Äôt find that here!
Get ready for a revolving door of clever lifestyle brand sponsors every week. Kielbasa and Kang squats? Could be a thing.
Anyway!
Get ready for the job stop action packed opinions and knowledge bombs from CWS and careful, don‚Äôt stare into those eye too deep or you‚Äôll get lost until you hit the end of your SRA curve!
On the other side of the coin the majestic Max Montana has your back for all things that will help ya jerk stronger and clean up that dirty old snatch of yours!
Basically if you are in the iron game you‚Äôre going to learn something and be entertained along the way.
Cheers to lifting more pounds or kilos!
Sean Mack"
3294,The JuggLife,Great Podcast,5,These guys have a wealth of knowledge about that Jugg Life! It‚Äôs a must listen.
3295,The JuggLife,Great content,4,"CWS and Max are knowledgeable as all get out and also super funny. Great guests. But guys, you gotta ditch the mid-rolls. They‚Äôre so obtrusive on the interviews. They gotta go!"
3296,The JuggLife,Current favorite podcast,5,"Chad is rad, Max is magnanimous, and the Jugglife-jubilant."
3297,The JuggLife,The highest quality podcast on training. Period.,5,"The content that JTS is producing is unquestionably the best overall content related to training on the market currently. The content is always interesting and consistently delivered in a way that is engaging. While there may be people out there that know just as much or are relaying some of the same information, there is no one with as high of a production value. The amount of care and time put into producing this top quality product is evident from the opening credits. Seriously. The only people producing this quality of a product is CrossFit, and they have the benefit of having a million dollar production facility. Kudos to JTS for taking the time and putting in the effort to produce such a fine product.
The best part... it‚Äôs free!
I recently signed up for their one on one online coaching and have been just as impressed with that as well. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing guys!"
3298,The JuggLife,THESE GUYS RULE!!!,5,The content that is put out my Chad and Max is top notch. Every time I see a new episode I get excited! Please don‚Äôt ever stop....
3299,The JuggLife,Wrong CWS,5,"At first I was disappointed that this isn‚Äôt Chad Wesley Smith the baseball player like I had hoped, but nevertheless I listened anyway. Little did I know that this Chad, (who must be the real Chad‚Äôs cousin or something?) puts on a fantastic show filled with laughs and tons of knowledge. In all seriousness he and Max are two of my favorite people to listen to, I really appreciate that they‚Äôre not afraid to give candid opinions about anything."
3300,The JuggLife,Amazing Content & Questionable Shoe Fashion,5,The Jugg Life is my go to pod cast for all things strength sports. As a powerlifter I thought I would skip over the episodes on weightlifting until I realized even the content focused on OLY lifting is interesting and valuable. Chad and Max have great chemistry together and bring complementary perspectives to every subject they cover. The consistent quality content is balanced well with questionable shoe fashion and witty discourse. Tune in once and you‚Äôll be hooked!
3301,The JuggLife,The Zenith of Fitness Podcasts,5,"The JuggLife is a fantastic podcast on topical subjects in weightlifting, powerlifting, and other strength and conditioning sports. They go out and interview real experts who have at least 2 of 3 things qualifications: A degree in their field of expertise, personal results in their own life, and results in the athletes they coach.
They have great charisma with each other and having meet them IRL it isn't put on! They both have a huge desire to teach and help others come to an understanding of how to properly train and progress.
And yes, Chad's blue eyes are vortexes that you can easily slip into if your not careful."
3302,The JuggLife,Quality content with inconsistent production,4,"One of the best fitness and strength podcasts around, but the overall production and audio quality has waned in the last year."
3303,The JuggLife,"Detailed, Informative, and Entertaining",5,"The Jugglife is an amazing series put out by 2 very accomplished strength athletes and coaches: Max Aita and Chad Wesley Smith. Their ability to clearly present information in an engaging way is the best I‚Äôve seen in the strength and fitness game. Alongside that, their performance as both coaches and competitors gives them a leg up on the competition in terms of credibility. Frequently, they bring on equally, if not more accomplished guests onto the show to include renowned coaches and Olympic champions from different areas of sport. I‚Äôve gotten a couple of my friends hooked, and they even went to check out their other stuff on Youtube. The only downside is you can‚Äôt visually appreciate Chad‚Äôs baby blues or Max‚Äôs Air Dad‚Äôs through a podcast."
3304,Official Beachbody Podcasts,Love it,5,Shakeology is by far the best products I have eve tried over a 100 is difficult yet it‚Äôs so worth it too
3305,Official Beachbody Podcasts,Shakeology,5,"I'm so thankful for the day my friend, Monica Gray, asked me if I wanted to try a sample. This was last year in June and since then, I have never missed a day! I used to suffer horribly from IBS and (not to give TMI) not be able to use the bathroom for sometimes weeks on end, horrible stomach aches, ect. Since starting Shakeology, my IBS is gone! I feel so much lighter, more energetic, and for someone who's a self-proclaimed natural-foods foodie, I only trust Shakeology as a meal replacement shake. If you are on the fence, just try it! You won't be sorry! I will start posting videos of my favorite recipes on my page, so please subscribe! :)"
3306,Official Beachbody Podcasts,Shakeology is Amazing!!!,5,"Shakeology is a great product! Watching these testimonials from doctors really shows the positive aspects of the product. I have been drinking it for about 6 months now and feel great. I recommend it to EVERYONE and want to help ""End the Trend"" of obesity. I hope they get more videos from Beachbody available on the Podcast!"
3307,Official Beachbody Podcasts,SHAKEOLOGY--Will never give it up!,5,"Our whole family LOVES Shakeology and we will never give it up! I love knowing I'm sending my daughter to school already having had the healthiest meal of her day--ready to take on her day! And for those who have trouble getting a healthy breakfast, there is nothing easier than whipping up a shake to take in the car. Shakeology gives you Energy, Mental Clarity, Protein, Curbs Cravings, lowers Cholesterol and TASTES AWESOME!"

3322,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Hate your comments about diabetes.,1,If I could give you zero stars I would. Your comments about diabetes were insensitive and totally inappropriate.
3323,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,USED to love this podcast!!,3,"I used to absolutely love this podcast. Jonathan has completely transformed the way I eat and exercise and I have lost 15 pounds as a result. More importantly, I feel fantastic and know that I can eat this way for the rest of my life and not feel deprived. Healthy food really is the best tasting food too!! Once you start eating ""real food"", the thought of putting processed ""carbage"" into your body is SO unappealing.
That being said, the most recent 2 podcasts are a completely different format than the old ones and I cannot listen anymore. He has a new cohost (Who seems to have come out of nowhere. He never mentioned any changes and never introduced her.) While I'm sure she is very nice, Jonathan's show is much better when he does it on his own. I especially like the podcasts when he interviewed other experts in the nutrition/exercise field. I love to hear other people's ideas.
Bottom line: listen to some of the old podcasts. He really does have great information that will make you a healthier you.
I'm hoping he sees the error of his ways and goes back to the old format. This information is too important for people to hear. I don't want them to get distracted by a bad podcast."
3324,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,A must listener a healthy lifestyle,5,A fantastic podcast with tons of valuable information presented in a fun and interesting way. The SANE approach has been working like a charm for me. Feel great and lost already 20 pounds. A fantastic guideline for a healthier living.
3325,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Fantastic life changing information,5,"So grateful, as a health and wellness enthusiast, that this vital information is getting out there. So grateful for the resource that I can share with my friends that can easily listen to and change their health and change their life!!
My only issue is that it's sometimes hard to listen to when April laughs after every thing she says üòÅ I'm not against laughter, but it's just really too much. Sorry!"
3326,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Inspirational!,5,"Have been listening to this now for about a year and look forward to it every week. What a great, inspirational resource. Thank you Jonathon! If you are looking for ways of improving your health and NOT starving yourself, look no further. Green smoothies will change your live."
3327,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Informative and approachable!,5,"This show keeps me sane and SANE! Super great compliment to the book, the calorie myth. It gives real life examples and troubleshooting for the bumps in the road when changing your diet and lifestyle."
3328,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,LOVE the new format!,5,"I have listened to almost all of Jonathan‚Äôs podcasts, read his book, and have been living almost completely SANE for 4 months. Everything I learned just made complete sense to me. I have a medical background and love that everything Jonathan relates comes from peer-reviewed scientific medical journals. It‚Äôs not HIS program. He has spent a lot of time collecting and sharing what research has shown for YEARS, but has failed to get out to the general public. I saw almost immediate results. I have tons more energy and I love how I feel! I am a 40-year-old mother of 4, and have been able to get my body back to the size it was in high school, and stronger than I have been in years. The best part is that it is so easy to do. There is a little bit of a learning curve at the beginning. Pretty much EVERYONE agrees we need to eat more vegetables, so that was where I began (lots of green smoothies!). Getting enough protein and whole-food-fats came next. Carrie Brown‚Äôs recipes have been super helpful too. I love to cook and have tons of fun cookbooks, so I started cutting out starches in them and using more vegetables. New habits take some time, but once they are in place it is fairly easy. I especially love that my exercise doesn‚Äôt take nearly as much time as it used to. I have more time with my family and for the other things I want to do with my day!
April Perry (his new cohost) has also been a great addition to the podcasts. She has 4 children of her own, and has made it easier to understand how to bring all this knowledge into our family, so this isn‚Äôt just ME getting healthier. I can help my family get healthier. I can keep them from having to deal with diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and other health problems that can be traced back to an unhealthy lifestyle. I can‚Äôt say enough about how I much I appreciate this program. I was familiar with April‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower of Mom‚Äôs‚Äù podcasts and website, and have grown to love and trust her over the years. I would probably never have followed this path if she hadn‚Äôt introduced me to Jonathan and The Calorie Myth. Because of her honesty and who she is, my family will be healthier and happier for years to come. Thank you April and Jonathan!"
3329,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,"Uplifting, thought provoking, and freeing!",5,"Love this podcast! Eating SANEly has been life changing- I have the correct knowledge to make educated, guilt free food choices for me and my family- and this podcasts help remind me of that:)"
3330,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,"Practical, informative, and positive!",5,"Listening to Jonathan and April motivates me not only to improve my health, but to strive for improvement in many areas of my life. One of my favorite podcasts was ‚ÄúHow to Lose That Last 10 lbs.‚Äù This was the key takeaway for me: ""It is normal to look around and compare our lives with others, but we can create a personal mission statement to read each day to remind ourselves of why we are waking up and what matters to us.‚Äù It reminded me of why I want to live a SANE lifestyle‚Ä¶it is to enable me to life the life I want to live. I do not miss the 15 lbs. I‚Äôve lost in the past 4 months. I have more energy to play with my children and they are learning heathy habits as well. It‚Äôs a win-win! Thank you April & Jonathan!"
3331,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Thank you!,5,Uplifting encouragement and common sense! I love this!

3333,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Wow this show is an encouragement...thanku JB...,5,"...For your data filled show on staying ""Sane"" in this inSane (at times) world...I appreciate mostly your heart -that all that you do comes from your sincere desire to help your fellowman - your patient encouragement and the ""how to"" facts on how to become the best version of ourselves we can (body,mind,spirit) are so needed at this time ...your sincerity really shines through JB and I think years from now you will be remembered for your contributions to help end obesity and diabetes...I think you're the happiest person on the planet that I've ever met...keep reaching for your own goals JB!

3335,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Great content! Wish I would've heard this years ago!,5,"So glad I stumbled across this podcast. The content and advice in this podcast is what America needs. I'm on a mission to become saner and really enjoy listening to Jonathan and April while cleaning up the house, doing laundry, or going for a walk!"
3336,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Too much giggling,3,"just resubscribed to the podcast..Where's Carrie? The new gal is just too giggly--sounds like a 13 year old--I will listen some more because I believe in the science behind SANE and have read Jonathan's book..just have the new gal listen to herself and tone it down a bit--enthusiasm is great, giggling doesn't work..."
3337,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,So frustrating!,1,"I find this podcast and everything having to do with the sane solution so frustrating. He never gives any information that actually helps me to do what he says I should do. For example, he says doing cardio isn't the smartest way to exercise, that there is a better way, but he never actually says what type of exercise we SHOULD do! He then says to go to his website. So I eagerly visit the website to find out the 'top secret' exercise plan and I can't find anything. It just repeats how we need to stop being so exercise obsessed and that less is more. Okay so what IS that less exercise? Walking? Lifting weights? Interval training? I want answers! I know that what he is saying is true, it makes so much sense and I want to be more sane because I believe in the philosophy he talks about but I wish he would be more forthcoming with the how. We live in a very busy world which is why I listen to podcasts for my information...I don't have all day to get lost on a rabbit hole website with no REAL and helpful information. If he truly cared about helping people become healthy he would make it easier to figure out HOW to live sanely and be healthy. He gives so much great information about the why and stimulus to back it up but never the most important part...the HOW. Please Jonathan bailor...give me some real, applicable information in your podcast and stop wasting my time."
3338,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Unsubscribe,2,"I used to like this show - except now we have to listen to April cry and whine because she can't look like a 20 year old when she's a 38 year old mother of 4. I thought that was the whole point of this show - to be SANE. Just because April has a problem with body image doesn't mean we have to entertain that every time we listen. I was trying to get AWAY from that by listening to this show. Big mis-step in content, guys. Are we SANE or aren't we??"
3339,SANE Show: Eat More. Lose More. Smile More. with Jonathan Bailor,Warriormom2,5,I'd like to say how happy I am that you make this available & your program affordable for people to try & stay on track! I am excited to get healthy & fit!
3340,"""Diet and Fitness Podcasts by Diet.com""",Not impressed,2,"The tips are decent, but they are all available in magazines. The host sounds tense. Like she's just reading from a script and isn't in it at all"
3341,"""Diet and Fitness Podcasts by Diet.com""",Great tidbits!,5,I personally really like this podcast. It's not too involved: easy-to-listen-to tips that won't take up too much of your time. And I think Lady Diet is pretty great. She's engaging and gives a personal spin on the stuff she's talking about. Keep the info coming!
3342,"""Diet and Fitness Podcasts by Diet.com""",Love it!!!,5,Thanks for the useful information. I enjoyed it very much.
3343,"""Diet and Fitness Podcasts by Diet.com""",Happy Dieter,5,"I have tried all kinds of diets and exercise routines. Either they were not working or just plain boring. I think that this podcast is great because it offers helpful tips, that I can easily fit into my hectic schedule. I am so glad that a well-known weight loss site is finally on iTunes!! I especially liked the one ""It's Summer! Get Out There and Exercise"" because it gives me confidence to get off of my butt and do some really exciting exercises that can help me achieve my goal to lose weight. Host Lady Diet is getting me to move!"
3344,"""Diet and Fitness Podcasts by Diet.com""",Informative but fun!,5,"I've listened to a lot of podcasts, but not necessarily ones under the Health category. I found this one and really like the content! I think Lady Diet (the host) offers really good insights on dieting and fitness issues. She is funny to listen to, as well. I especially like the episodes about celebrity diet secrets and college food dilemmas. The best part is Lady Diet's podcast episodes are short enough that you won't get bored. You should subscribe if you want quick, helpful diet and fitness tips!"
3345,Our Hen House,Absolutely LOVE this podcast!!!,5,"I started listening to this podcast over 3 years ago and I haven‚Äôt missed a week since. Jasmin and Mariann make me laugh, make me think, and I‚Äôm constantly learning something new. The interviews are incredible and the chemistry between Jasmin and Mariann constantly makes me smile.
For those of us vegans who want to stay in the loop, this is the podcast to listen to.
Don‚Äôt forget to listen all the way to the end because the best moments are in Mariann‚Äôs segment ‚ÄúAnxieties are RISING!‚Äù
Thank you Mariann and Jasmin for being there for us every week."
3346,Our Hen House,Top fave podcast,5,"I have to listen every Saturday! I love Jasmin and Mariann‚Äôs relationship, getting to learn about all the amazing things being done to help animals, and of course the ridiculous rising anxieties! I wish so much that I could be part of the flock and I will one day (hopefully near future). My family is currently in dire financial straits, but it‚Äôs on my plan and will soon be on my budget. $10/month is really not a bad deal at all and I recommend anyone who is able should do it to support media and get some bonus content! I‚Äôm looking forward to it!"
3347,Our Hen House,Our Hen House,5,"This is a great podcast, highlighting vegan and animal rights issues. Lots of interesting and provocative guests. I especially love listening to the co hosts discuss their week and banter a bit. It‚Äôs like having a few friends over while I‚Äôm doing my chores."
3348,Our Hen House,One of my new favorite podcast,5,You ladies are awesome and I can‚Äôt wait to hear more!!!
3349,Our Hen House,Justin‚Äôs Podcast,1,Just listened and am so disappointed that a law professor would write a bob without any facts to support his premise and you would allow him to keep on talking without asking for any detail or support.
3350,Our Hen House,Love üíó you guys,5,Thank you for all you share. I‚Äôm newer to the vegan world so listen to many podcasts about it. Yours being one of them. ‚ô•Ô∏è

3354,Our Hen House,Best vegan news podcast!,5,"I love the breadth and depth of this podcast and the easygoing back-and-forth between Jasmin and MaryAnn. They‚Äôre bright and funny. I like how they address not only the current issues but, sometimes, take a hard look at others‚Äô - and their own - coverage of them. I look forward to it every week."
3355,Our Hen House,Great way to keep up on the vegan movement!,5,I am happy member of the OHH flock! I enjoy listening to this professionally made podcast each week to hear the news that effects me as a vegan. Some of the biggest names and most influential people in the vegan movement are featured in interviews and I have learned so much from this podcast. One of favorite things is that OHH focuses on how the arts can influence and support the vegan movement.
3356,Our Hen House,Fave!,5,Seriously my favorite podcast. I like that every episode has so much content and a variety of content. I look forward to each new episode.
3357,Our Hen House,Empowering and Inspiring,5,"I LOVE Our Hen House!!!!!

3362,Our Hen House,Best Podcast I Listen To,5,"By far my favorite. Jasmin and Mariann are so entertaining and the interviews are with amazing people. I am always impressed with the questions that each of these women comes up with for the guests; they really are seasoned and considerate interviewers, and I am usually left with the sense that the guests are pleased with the depth that comes out of the conversation. Definitely recommend!!!"

3365,Our Hen House,"Great content, great cast",5,"Good job guys, just one question, why end with rising anxieties?"
3366,Our Hen House,Excellent and Varied Podcast,5,"I look forward to this podcast every Saturday afternoon and evening. In an area where there are few vegans it is an oasis in my week. I disagree with those that thought it was too long before. I liked it that way. The interviews are excellent , especially when the topic is more centered on the animal liberation theme and not tangential issues like intersectionality. Thanks, Mary Ann and Jasmin. ................VV"

3368,Our Hen House,Such a gem!!,5,"Ive listened to Our Hen House since the beginning and it just keeps getting better! I love the intersectionality of the discussions, Ive learned SO much! And speaking as someone who struggles with feeling hopeful about the state of animals in this world, Our Hen House is a sparkler in a dark room and is constantly making me feel hopeful and that this fight is worth keeping up because we can do it! And the segment 'Rising Anxieties' proves that we ARE doing it! With tremendous help from resources like Our Hen House :)
Its also hard sometimes to be the only vegan in the room, or the family, or the class and being able to pop my headphones on and listen to people speak about animals as if their lives have meaning beyond our desires for their bodies and babies... Its valuable beyond words. Ok, what else... I love the occasional cursing, I love the banter, I love the guest choices, uh, such a GEM!!
Also highly recommend Jasmins book 'Always Too Much and Never Enough' (read by the author) and the Animal Law Podcast that Mariann does!!"
3369,Our Hen House,So SO so sooo good!!,5,"I‚Äôm completely crazy about this podcast. It‚Äôs enormously enriching, brilliantly candid, fantastically insightful, AND keeps me up-to-date on animal advocacy current events. Thank you Jasmin and Mariann for bringing us the premium content!!"
3370,Our Hen House,Wonderful Podcast,1,You all sound really wonderful and I really enjoyed listening to your podcast. I‚Äôm a lifelong vegan and I love to hear other vegans talk about the vegan lifestyle. Major good changes are happening.
3371,Our Hen House,Super good!,5,"Incredible podcast- makes me feel less alone in this crazy mixed up world. Always engaging, always thought provoking, and always upbeat even when dealing with necessary, dark subject matter."
3372,Our Hen House,My absolute favorite podcast!!,5,"Our Hen House has helped me through some dark times and uplifted me on multiple occasions when I really needed it. I love Mariann and Jasmin for their humor, frank & intelligent commentary, insightful interviews with fascinating guests, joyful celebrations of all things vegan, & deep dedication to changing the world for animals!! I‚Äôve learned SO MUCH and feel inspired at the end of every episode. Definitely one of the most useful tools in my activist toolkit. Three cheers for Our Hen House!!! üíöüíöüíö"
3373,Our Hen House,my favorite podcast,5,I truly enjoy the Our Hen House podcast. I look forward to listening to it each week. Mariann and Jasmin are great! I wish I could afford to donate money to their podcast.
3374,Our Hen House,The only podcast I never miss!,5,"I love Our Hen House! It's a great way to keep up with vegan news and animal rights issues I care about. I feel more connected to the world around me, and the vegan community as whole, because of this wonderful show. Jasmin and Mariann really have the ability to make me laugh and feel hope even in the midst of hearing painful news and updates that would otherwise made me cry. Thank you so much for your podcast, it's changed my life. I'm a loyal fan for life!"
3375,Weight Loss Nation,Awesome Real Talk!,5,"I‚Äôm loving Weight Loss Nation and the fun, candid conversations!"
3376,Weight Loss Nation,Yikes,1,"I was looking into new podcasts to add to my list and stumbled upon this one. Who doesn‚Äôt want to lose weight right? I have been listening to a non stop ramble about tea. It comes off as a sales pitch, being followed by the speaker directing the audience to a website where they can purchase the tea. I thought that IG models were the only ones shoving tea upon us. Seems like this tea that promotes 5 lbs of weight loss in a week has also made its way into the podcast world. I have never left s bad review anywhere, but this podcast was really bad in regards to messaging. Perhaps you should talk bout other teas and the research and comparisons. Instead of literally just trying to sell a tea via your podcast. Either way I subscribed and unsubscribed due to the terrible messaging"
3377,Weight Loss Nation,Love Diane!,5,Love this show and love Diane!! She is so funny!
3378,Weight Loss Nation,Yes!!! Fun + healthy living üíØ,5,"Omg Diane is so hilarious and a joy to listen to!!! She‚Äôs super charismatic and really makes healthy living choices relatable and fun. I really enjoy tuning in. Thanks, Diane."
3379,Weight Loss Nation,Best weight loss podcast!,5,"Love this show! Diane is one of the most genuine, funny, and inspirational podcasters i know. Highly recommend this podcast"
3380,Weight Loss Nation,A great place to start turning around your health!,5,Diane is so refreshing to listen to because she's so down to earth and truly wants to help her listeners get the best information they need to become healthy. Offers a variety of different topics from wellness to nutrition to recovery and more. Such great info and I highly suggest you take a listen!
3381,Weight Loss Nation,Is it just me???,3,"I‚Äôm very excited to have this podcast,however, it seems that there is this HORRIBLE background noise that sounds like some type of bell that is attempting to sound like a typewriter maybe??!!
Am I the only person hearing this because I have not read anything in other reviews.
I will say this; if this is playing in the background on purpose, please reconsider. Nothing you say is heard because I can‚Äôt drown out this most hellish noise pollution."
3382,Weight Loss Nation,Weight Loss by Dancing?,1,I figured let me listen to the episode about losing weight by dancing. The entire episode revolved around Howl at the Moon and how great the bar is. The episode didn‚Äôt cover any information on how dancing helps weight loss. I figured he would talk about the types of dancing that help weight loss etc...
3383,Weight Loss Nation,Hilarious! Diane makes you laugh NY style :),5,"I especially like Diane's restaurant reviews, she really paints a vivid picture of each dining experience. It's like sitting down alongside her and her podcaster buddies as she wines and dines her seasoned palette. Such a blast! Save yourself the trouble of bad restaurant experiences, just trust Diane. You'll be so glad you did."
3384,Weight Loss Nation,Horrible,1,Sounds like an infomercial. He speaks so slowly so annoying

3405,The Strength Running Podcast,Coaching Conversations and Inspiration,5,"As a new runner but long time active person, this pod has been a tremendous source of learning content, guidance and inspiration during my first season. Jason is a true coach who can apply a few core concepts to any runner to help each person perform better and enjoy this amazing sport more. Great interviews, pro tips and even solid discussions about non-running things like practicing presence with people in your life, habit shaping, healthy mental health practices, and freedom from some of the toxic impacts of comparison are part of the dialogue too."
3406,The Strength Running Podcast,A fantastic resource for coaches and athletes!,5,I have been listening to the Strength Running podcast for the last few months and am hooked! I learn something from each episode and as a coach of athletes myself this is an invaluable resource. I continue to learn things that I can apply in my coaching to help my athletes and my own training!
3407,The Strength Running Podcast,Beat running podcast,5,"Hands down the best podcast out there for information on how to become a better runner. I run 20-40 miles per week depending on the time of year (used to only run 5-10 per week 2 yrs ago). This podcast has helped me with recovery, injury prevention, how to structure workouts, and how to incorporate strength training. Can‚Äôt say enough about how valuable it has been to me becoming a better runner."
3408,The Strength Running Podcast,Fantastic,5,The advice I have picked up from Jason‚Äôs podcast is instrumental. It helped this weekend warrior shave almost 3 min of my 5k time.
3409,The Strength Running Podcast,Love this podcast!,5,Thank you Jason for this podcast! I listen to it everyday and has made me a better runner. Highly recommend!
3410,The Strength Running Podcast,Awesome Podcast!,5,The recent interview with Luke Tyburski was great! I LOVED that you guys talked about how athletes can often underestimate the amount of time it can take to achieve some goals. This is such an important topic and doesn‚Äôt often get a lot of play. Keep up the great work and thanks for an awesome podcast!
3411,The Strength Running Podcast,Excellent,5,Jason is one of the best in podcast he is always prepared and knowledgeable in the subject. I follow his trainings and I really feel I have learned a lot about running.
3412,The Strength Running Podcast,Don‚Äôt get political,2,Seemed okay until he just had to add his political commentary. I won‚Äôt be listening again.
3413,The Strength Running Podcast,5* Content,5,"I am a long time listener and supporter of Strength Running. Jason‚Äôs approach to running may not seem new now as Strength Training for runners is all the rage now-a-days. However, he was one of the first to popularize the methods.
In regards to coaching, I tried his elite program. Although I can be a dumb runner at times, Jason‚Äôs program made me stronger and more mobile helping me to run faster while staying injury free. He helped me find my strengths and weaknesses, and for that I am very appreciative.
If you‚Äôre looking for inspiration, check out Episode 22 Dear Boston Marathon Runners. I listen to it before every race. If you‚Äôre looking for knowledge, there‚Äôs plenty of knowledgeable people and references in just about every show. Jason‚Äôs coaching methods fits both the recreational runner and the sub-elite. You will find valuable gems and wisdom in the Strength Running podcast.
Marathon PR - 2:43:01"
3414,The Strength Running Podcast,Wide range of topics,5,I love the wide range of topics and guests. It really helps to think about my running in different ways. I have enjoyed learning about people in the running world as well!
3415,The Strength Running Podcast,Best running pod cast out there,5,"I have listened to many different pod casts about running and this is the one I stay up to date with. Professional guests. Each pod cast I learn something new that I apply to my running. Add that to his endless YouTube videos, Instagram videos and posts as well as the fact that he does respond to email questions, Jason is a leading force in the running world for beginners to advanced runners. If I had the $ means and wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdo it yourselfer‚Äù, I‚Äôd hire him as my coach."
3416,The Strength Running Podcast,Great tactical podcast for runners!,5,"Just because you're not a professional athlete, doesn't mean you can't benefit from embracing similar training principles. Jason Fitzgerald does a great job of introducing advanced training concepts through a lens that can be embraced by those who also have a day job, families, and other responsibilities to contend with.
Additionally, Jason is a great host who keeps the conversation smooth.
Running as a sport does not have the coverage that other sports (NBA, NFL, etc.) have in the media, so it's always nice to discover a running podcast that is well produced!"
3417,The Strength Running Podcast,Waste of Time,1,"Don't waste your time with listening or paying for Jason's programs. There are plenty of FREE programs on the internet for runners wanting to strength train. A good example is Athlean-X on Youtube run by Jeff Cavaliere. 9.5 million subscribers for a reason. And he is actually strong, unlike this guy. Maybe when Jason is mature enough to accept constructive criticism, build some muscle of his own, and let go of his political biases, he will find success. Outside of the podcast, Jason is a complete moron."
3418,The Strength Running Podcast,Should be ZERO STARS,1,"I never realized Jason Fitzgerald is a complete jackass. I privately and respectfully emailed him today to tell him to knock off the political jabs I noticed in the last few podcasts. I wanted to keep it private instead of posting it to a public customer review. I felt it was a fair thing to do. Instead, he dismisses what I have to say by replying ""OK Boomer"". So rude and unprofessional. Your weak character shows."
3419,The Strength Running Podcast,Strength Running,5,"Jason seems to provide quality information from reputable sources and proven data from my lay perspective. The podcast is clear, keeps my attention and has a positive energy. The topics clearly relate to improving our running potential. Nice work!"
3420,The Strength Running Podcast,YALL TRIPPIN,3,"With all due respect...episode 130 was lackluster. The guest is not a runner. She didn‚Äôt even have new insight to offer outside of what is repeated online.
Please deliver the very content that us listeners love. We value the unique perspectives of people who are also apart of this community."
3421,The Strength Running Podcast,Put it in perspective,5,"This is my go-to podcast when going on my medium to long runs.
This is a recent message I sent to Jason based on his last chat with an inspiring sub-3 marathoner.
‚ÄúJust listened to your coach-call. It‚Äôs awesome to hear these meetings with the inspired. I‚Äôm in the same boat...25, 3:58:00 marathon, trying to get under 3:15:00. Next marathon is the Marine Corps Marathon in October. Listening to this one put everything into perspective rather than trying to emulate elite runner training programs. Thanks, dude!"
3422,The Strength Running Podcast,Disappointing,2,"I‚Äôve enjoyed past episodes, but have not listened in a while. I tried to catch up by listening to the mental toughness show, which I found disappointing. Little insight, mostly descriptive, and clearly intended as a commercial to sign up for Mindset Mastery. I don‚Äôt fault you for the commercial or the program, but next time separate the show and the commercial."
3423,The Strength Running Podcast,Running knowledge library,5,I have been listening to this podcast for about 5 months and I have listened from the beginning to the end. This has became a morning routine staple to help improve my running while preventing off time due to injury. Thank you Jason for what you are doing.
3424,The Strength Running Podcast,This podcast truly has incredible content!,5,"I found this podcast in the fall of last year and started listening anytime I was driving! Jason Fitzgerald hosts many high quality guests and they share wonderful information on health, running, strength training, injury prevention, and so much more! I‚Äôve listened to some of these twice! As a certified personal trainer and certified Sports Performance specialist, I find the content to be of superior quality. I have learned so much and I‚Äôve found great authors as a result to enrich my learning. In addition, the interviews are entertaining and engaging!! This is a must in your podcast library no matter where you are in your running journey!"
3425,The Strength Running Podcast,Great,5,My favorite running podcast! It is extremely informative from an extremely accomplished and humble running coach. I will continue to listen as long as Jason keeps putting out episodes
3426,The Strength Running Podcast,Great content,5,"I throughly enjoy listening to this podcast. I recently launched a podcast myself, Living It Up with Lenise, and this podcast has been such an inspiration for how I want my podcast to develop. Engaging. Informative. Concise."
3427,The Strength Running Podcast,Must listen poscast for runners,5,I started listening to running podcasts just recently and strength running podcast is one of the best if not the best running podcast to listen to. Each episodes are very informative and helps any runner (beginner or seasoned runners) to become a better runner. Always looking forward to listen to the next episodes!
3428,The Strength Running Podcast,One of the Best,5,"I‚Äôve been looking for a running centric podcast for a while now and woah did I hit the jackpot. Injury prevention is huge to me and after getting hit with some ITB syndrome after my first HM finding this podcast has help keep me sane in the couple weeks I haven‚Äôt been able to run.
Informative, to the point, helpful, and entertaining is how I would describe this podcast, it fills me up on running geek knowledge and it‚Äôs slue of hyper informative guests have never made me bored.

Every time I finish an episode I want to go for a run, I think that says a lot to the quality of this podcast and how hard Jason has worked to make great enjoyable content. Can‚Äôt wait to keep listening!!"
3429,The Strength Running Podcast,Positivity & Science,5,"Jason‚Äôs approach to helping others run better is fantastic, and he has a gift for extracting key insights from the best in the field has been a big part of my huge improvements in running over the past few years. In particular, I love the combination of science-based nutrition and hydration with heavy doses of positivity and emphasis on mental strength. I also think Jason is a great host‚Äîhe lets the guests (who are always experts in their field) talk, and avoids making the show about himself instead."
3430,The Strength Running Podcast,The Hands Down Best Running Podcast,5,"The Strength Running Podcast is hands down the best running podcast out there. Outstanding guests and insights. Extremely helpful. Jason is an articulate host, and I feel he really cares about improving his listeners' running."
3431,The Strength Running Podcast,Good,4,Enjoyed the insight from running coach to student.
3432,The Strength Running Podcast,Great podcasts,5,"Strength Running‚Äôs content is relevant to all levels of runners. I appreciate that Jason continues to search for new knowledge, which is the sign of a tru professional."
3433,The Strength Running Podcast,Great!!,5,Awesome podcast. It really helped me prepare for my first marathon!
3434,The Strength Running Podcast,Running tips,5,I love listening to your podcast. I played it while Im running. Thanks for the advices. Its really great help on my running.
3435,Physique Science Radio,20% substance.,2,"I thought I was being hypercritical when I initially contemplated writing a review mentioning the severe need for brevity, but after reading the comments, I see it‚Äôs not just me.
If it‚Äôs not a digression, it‚Äôs the hour and a half (obviously exaggerating) lead into the point. That is how it feels though. I‚Äôve listened to 4 different episodes and felt like this at several points.
This podcast is like an an hour worth of material with 12 mins worth of substance.
The narcissism is palpable but not quite bad enough to turn me off. Still gonna listen to more to be sure. Having said all that, I‚Äôm interested in your ideas lol."
3436,Physique Science Radio,Um uh,3,I really want to listen to this podcast but I‚Äôm having trouble getting past all the ‚Äúums‚Äù and ‚Äúuhs‚Äù üò£
3437,Physique Science Radio,The worst,1,"Horrible sound quality but even if I‚Äôm could suffer through it the material was trash. They dint talk about what the description says, they just pat themselves on the back and talk about what wonderful things they have done.‚ÄùI know I know I know‚Äù ‚ÄúI trained him, I trained him I trained him‚Äù"
3438,Physique Science Radio,Can‚Äôt hear,1,Horrible sound quality. Was excited to listen.
3439,Physique Science Radio,Fix your audio,1,"Can‚Äôt do it, like everyone said the sound quality is crap. Real shame sounds interesting"
3440,Physique Science Radio,Terrible sound quality,1,Worst sound quality on any podcast ever
3441,Physique Science Radio,Fix the audio,1,What is with the weird feedback??
3442,Physique Science Radio,Great information,5,"There‚Äôs a lot of really good information that can help our population avoid this obesity epidemic. This is also a great podcast for personal trainer out there, that is looking for growth, information, and from others perspectives. The audio is pretty bad, but in my opinion, The information and topics outweigh it."
3443,Physique Science Radio,Content is great but the sound quality is very poor,3,Content is great but the sound quality is very poor. I got through a couple of episodes ok but the last one i listened to was impossible
3444,Physique Science Radio,"Content good, sound quality horrible",3,"I generally like Layne Norton. He's straightforward, in your face, but he knows his stuff. He always brings this science. Some of the episodes are a bit long with rambling but you can always skip. Unfortunately, the sound quality on most (or too many) episodes is horrible. I couldn't even listen to the one with Dom D'Agostino. It was inaudible and disappointing."
3445,Physique Science Radio,Never to old to learn,5,"This podcast is great, every episode you are taking away a lot of great information. Dr. Layne Norton does a great job of explaining principles and ideas and not making them hard to understand. In addition Sohee is a great addition to the show and brings a unique perspective."
3446,Physique Science Radio,"Terrible Interview Skills, Needs a Producer/Audio Engineer",2,"Content quality is good but way too often goes into a tangent ""mocking"" or ""role playing"" his response from a hypothetical question.... Obviously not an interviewer but should really work on getting the discussion to flow better/more natural. Can sense moments of awkwardness... Audio is horrid and unbalanced. At times Can hear Layne type or multitask during guest speaking. Ads midway through are way too high. Could really use the help of a producer or audio engineer."
3447,Physique Science Radio,Awesome Podcast!,5,So much great information!
3448,Physique Science Radio,Great podcast,5,Full of very useful information about nutrition and training!
3449,Physique Science Radio,EPISODE #4 CHANGED THE GAME,5,"I love exercise science! I have been hooked since I was 16. I have spent years researching, lifting and reading. Episode 4 changed everything for me. Some of the most profound information I have ever heard. Game changing!"
3450,Physique Science Radio,Great podcast,5,The hosts are entertaining and informative.
3451,Physique Science Radio,Fantastic content,5,Fantastic content and wonderful guest speakers. Audio could be improved and ads could be changed or varied but content deserves over 5 stars
3452,Physique Science Radio,Such valuable information,5,Thanks for this podcast. Your information has really opened my eyes to nutrition. Please keep the material coming
3453,Physique Science Radio,Awesome!,5,Just came across this podcast and listened to every episode in a few days! I absolutely love not only the information but how educational each podcast is. Keep them coming!
3454,Physique Science Radio,Amazing Information,5,Listening to Layne has changed the way I view fitness as well as the way I train my clients. Love this channel !
3455,Physique Science Radio,Absolutely AMAZING podcast,5,"Every single episode is so informational. Sohee (I hope that's how you spell itüôà) and Layne together are the perfect balance. This podcast covers nutrition, workouts, mindset, the science behind everything, and so much more. I can't get enough of their podcasts the least I can do is give them a good rating for their hard work & FREE information they are putting out there. Seriously thank you guys so much, keep them coming!!‚ù§Ô∏èüôåüèº"
3456,Physique Science Radio,Very informative!,4,I love the podcast. Great info and fascinating topics. I have one bit of constructive criticism. Please work on the audio. Often the guests are hard to hear and Sohee is extremely loud and blowing out the audio. Pay more attention to levels or upgrade your sound equipment. I hate to have to turn off the show due to intolerable audio levels. Thanks!
3457,Physique Science Radio,Enjoyable and informative,4,"I really enjoy the thoroughness and how relative the information is for normal, as well as advanced, healthy, active people. Really enjoy it. Only problem is Sohee screaming into the microphone. Has really frightened me multiple times where I have to lower the volume just when she speaks. May also help if she could slow down and relax a little bit when she's speaking as she talks extremely fast like she is racing. But other than that I highly recommend this podcast. Thanks."
3458,Physique Science Radio,Love this podcast!!,5,"The episode with Dr Kori is the best I've heard. I've been in and out of recovery for bulimia and binge eating for the last 15 years and I think there needs to be more psychological-based forums on athletic pursuits like this.
Thanks so much guys and keep up the great work...ill be listening!"
3459,Physique Science Radio,By far my fav podcast!!!,5,If you haven't checked these out.. what are you waiting on??? By far the best free information you can get from a podcast!
3460,Physique Science Radio,You need to put layne in the title,4,It was really hard to find this podcast. I would've found it by accident months ago when I entered his name in the search on iTunes
3461,Physique Science Radio,Great Content But......,2,The poor audio quality makes the show a hard listen. Layne sounds like he is in a cave the and the co-host sounds like a female robot.
3462,Physique Science Radio,I love episode 25!,5,Would love to hear more about the business side of fitness! Between Mike Thurston and you guys I decided to get my personal training certification as my first step! Just realized fitness/lifting makes me happy and If one day I can make a living from it then that would be perfect! If not the knowledge will never leave me so it's a true win win!
3463,Physique Science Radio,Awesome Podcast,5,"The host, Layne Norton, highlights all aspects of fitness and nutrition in this can't miss podcast. The host and expert guests offer insightful advice that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
3464,Physique Science Radio,Wanted to love this,2,"I listen to a ton of podcasts and heard Dr Norton as a guest on a couple. His ideas were interesting to me and so I decided to check out his show. However when I came to Physique Science Radio I was disappointed because while there‚Äôs nuggets of helpful advice and wisdom, the audio quality is often terrible (especially on the Dom D‚ÄôAgostino episode where I couldn‚Äôt hear large portions of the guest portion of the interview). Way too much of that elevator music during the chunky transitions and the number and length of advertisements seem disproportionate to what is typical in podcasting generally. It makes it kind of excruciating to try to listen sometimes. That said, not all the episodes are that way, and I did enjoy the parts where scientists are able to be heard clearly speaking. But without any consistency of quality, I don‚Äôt want to bother listening to minutes of oatmeal ads only to discover I‚Äôve hit another dud episode."
3465,Iron Radio,Sniffling,4,The incessant sniffling from Phil is quite distracting. Not sure if he realizes how much he does this.
3466,Iron Radio,The cure for road rage,5,"I owe these guys. I started listening around episode 30, maybe ‚Äò09? Back when I was young, and had a long commute. I knew that at least one day a week I wouldn‚Äôt have road rage issues thanks to these newly found podcasts.
It's great to be able to hear from both the scientific side, as well as the real world, hands on side. The hosts have a wealth of knowledge. On top of that, they are entertaining and likable enough to keep you listening."
3467,Iron Radio,Life Changing,5,"I don‚Äôt write iTunes reviews, but this podcast compelled me. The amount of useful information contained within this archive (dating back years) is astounding. I was an untrained couch potato until I recently needed a change for health reasons. I was thirsty for real knowledge- not bro science. If you want to get big & strong, listen to these podcasts. Really."
3468,Iron Radio,Start Mondays rught,5,"This is my go to podcast every Monday morning as I drive to my first clients house. The cast is knowledgeable, funny and wise. The information makes me delve in deeper after listening to find out more of what they were talking about.l that day. Keep up the great works guys. Bring back Fortress!!"
3469,Iron Radio,Perfect balance...,5,"of science and experience. These guys have the education and practical knowledge to cut through the BS in the news/social media to provide real, useful lifting and nutrition advice. I haven‚Äôt missed an episode in five years. And they never miss a week!"
3470,Iron Radio,Perfect mix. Not total meathead or egghead.,5,"I‚Äôm so glad I found this podcast about a year ago! I‚Äôm a newly certified personal trainer as well as pre/med student so I love how this show caters to multiple aspects of what I‚Äôm interested in.
I was wondering if you guys (if you haven‚Äôt already) do an episode on recovery. Stretching/foam rolling in particular. I‚Äôve heard very contradictory things regarding both so I would love it if you could shine some light on the subject.
Thanks again for all that you do!"
3471,Iron Radio,Takes me back,5,I am one of Dr Lowery‚Äôs former students. Love hearing his analytical approach and his naturally entertaining way of delivering information that could be chunky if you aren‚Äôt used to it. Glad I found this.
3472,Iron Radio,The best podcast around,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to several podcasts in the past and kinda skipped from one to the other. Once I found Iron Radio I knew I found the one source for sports and nutrition news, studies and information. No need to look further! Just the right amount of humor and knowledge."
3473,Iron Radio,Best of the Best,5,"In no particular order, here's a list of reasons why they're great
1.) They really know what they're talking about. As a team, they have (a.) academic/science-based backgrounds (b.) real-world experience, and (c.) experience teaching/coaching. That's worth a TON. If you're actually trying to learn something from a podcast, you want hosts that have all of that. And they've been in the strength community for years. I can't even wrap my head around the wealth of knowledge these guys have.
2.) The hosts bring a nice variety of different types of (relevant) backgrounds. E.g., it's not just about training nor just about nutrition. And for those interested in competing, the hosts have expereince doing and/or coaching strongman, powerlifting, olympic lifting and bodybuilding.
3.) They seem like nice guys. I hate that I even have to write that, but I don't find that true of all strength-related podcasts. (E.g., in contrast, some other shows have commentary laced with homophobic and sexist comments and I'm not cool with that.)
4.) They have great banter because (a.) iIt feels like hanging out with your gym fam and (b.) it stays related to the general wheelhouse of what the audience is there for (i.e., it's not random 20-minute ramblings about totally non-related stuff as some podcasts do)
5.) They're not there to sell you anything. They're motives are 100% about giving back. (See #3 about them seeming like nice guys -- how nice is it that they have taken time out of their lives every week for a decade just to ensure that the strength community has a high-quality source of information we can depend on?) Aside from that being amazing of them, it means that they aren't framing their opinions or topics of the day in order to sell you stuff. To me that just adds an extra something that helps me trust them even more.
6.) they are so reliable week after week that they just become a part of your training life after a while. They're like the audio version of your audio training partner that always shows up for you and is there to see you become better.
I'm sure I'll think of more reasons after I've posted this too. I mean, they really are the best of the best as far as these types of podcasts go.
Thanks fellas for all your hard work over the years."
3474,Iron Radio,Great podcast,5,"This is a wonderful podcast. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten to know these guys over the past couple of years. I recommend going all the way back and listening to them all from the beginning. It‚Äôs very informative without the sales pitch many of the other podcasts have. Keep it up guys, I never miss it."
3475,Primal Endurance Podcast,Loved Dr Cucuzzella interview!,5,"Always love your podcast Brad, and especially enjoyed learning about Dr C and all the amazing things he is doing at his hospital. My husband and I both work in a hospital and can‚Äôt imagine what it would take for this MUCH NEEDED change to happen. Awesome guy and awesome interview"
3476,Primal Endurance Podcast,"Awesome show, highly recommend!",5,"Brad and his expert guests provide some incredibly compelling content that‚Äôs geared to help you take actionable steps to reach a new level of sustained performance.
Highly recommend listening and subscribing to The Primal Endurance Podcast if you want the knowledge AND mindsets to level up both mentally and physically (and reach your overall athletic goals as a result)!"
3477,Primal Endurance Podcast,Great podcast,5,Great podcast with a lot of helpful information and tips for pursuing a healthier lifestyle.
3478,Primal Endurance Podcast,Mark Cucuzzella Podcast,5,"Loved this interview with Dr. Mark Cucuzzella. After hearing talks like this one, I'm actually hopeful and optimistic that one day we can slowly start to turn the insulin steamship around. Being a physician helps, since most MD's only want to be educated by other MD's. He has made several significant contributions to patient care, hospital food service and educational materials and is also an impressive endurance athlete. Great podcast."
3479,Primal Endurance Podcast,I am such a fan!!!,5,"I look forward to all the episodes. I learn something new with everyone and the advice and recommendations have helped me tremendously physically, emotionally, and mentally. My approach to health has been forever changed. Thank you!!!"
3480,Primal Endurance Podcast,Amazing information,5,Brad is highly entertaining and breaks down so many myths around nutrition and endurance. Entertains and informs even for those who aren't endurance athletes
3481,Primal Endurance Podcast,"Solid info, easy to implement",5,"This podcast is slowly changing my life. I've incorporated many of the concepts presented, especially benefiting from the expert way host Brad Kearns walks you through highlights from each chapter of the excellent book."
3482,Primal Endurance Podcast,Great!,5,"Tons of useful, life altering, info."
3483,Primal Endurance Podcast,Very helpful for my training,5,This podcast has shifted my focus from short term fitness goals to considering whether my training is helping my long term health. Submitted a question and received a detailed response.
3484,Primal Endurance Podcast,Bard and Lindsay great Combo,5,"Always a great podcast. The few with Lindsay are just outstanding. Thanks for helping me be better me.
The audio needs some work. Phones and dogs are annoying. Also seems a bit of echo at times. But they are easy fixes"
3485,The Official Isagenix Podcast,I'm so grateful,5,"I'm so grateful for this resource. I love that variety in topics, from product reviews, testimonials, priceless trainings that I can listen to and learn from repeatedly! Just one question. Why am I only able to see the last 10 podcasts?"
3486,The Official Isagenix Podcast,Good stuff!,5,So many different points of view. All gooooood! Just don't know why there has not been an update in a month.
3487,The Official Isagenix Podcast,Absolutely the Best!!!!,5,"I'll never listen to the radio again!! Why would I, the radio doesn't make me money!!! Team Topballerz!"

Could not make it through even this 10 minute episode."
