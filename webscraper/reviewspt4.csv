0,Small Town Horror,Strong start but ....,3,"Hooked at the outset but wears thin over time ... Appreciate the great effort, though. Would love to hear new material from the same creative team. üôÇ"
1,Small Town Horror,Better as binge but lots of filler,3,Great start then filler. Cliffhanger endings leave you coming back
2,Small Town Horror,"Scary at first, loses direction",2,"I loved this show in the first season. It was so, so creepy. And then...they ran out of ideas? Didn‚Äôt know where to go? It got boring and directionless."
3,Small Town Horror,Toots,5,Is that a fart at 9:27 on Voices from the Past? It‚Äôs cracking me up.
4,Small Town Horror,Only one problem,5,"I‚Äôm only a few episodes in, and I only have one problem. In the first episode you reference a thumb safety on a Glock, which Glocks do not have. Other than that, great podcast."
5,Small Town Horror,Drinking during recording? Come on...,3,"Ok so, the story seems interesting. I have a lot of questions, and from the reviews I've read, I'm not quite sure if they are answered or not. Some of the recent ones say yes and others say no - but I'm interested either way.
I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the narrator...
I'm on a few episodes into the first season, and I'm really hoping he stops all of this. This is now the 4th time I've tried to listen to this show, and had to stop because his noises makes my stomach turn. I'm going to keep it going this time, but I'm really hoping he gives up his sounds.
I've read good things online about the show, but come on...
One of my biggest pet peeves is loud eaters/drinkers - and this guy makes a point to be obnoxious every time he has something in his mouth.
Not to mention he WANTS to come across as an alcoholic, instead of just being an alcoholic. He seems to be proud of it. Every time he's drinking something, he's chugging it, and then makes gross sighs afterwards like he just got down filming a beer commercial.
I don't know, maybe it's just me... But it's thoroughly disgusting.
Truthfully, I don't care how cool the plot sounds, if I had another show to listen to, I would.
I just can't find anything else to keep my attention."
6,Small Town Horror,Binge worthy mystery,5,"I like this a lot l. I‚Äôm picky when it comes to podcasts in general, twice as much with fiction. This was a great hidden gem. Can‚Äôt wait to finish üòÅ"
7,Small Town Horror,Just no.,1,"This entire show is a miss, I‚Äôve given it multiple chances over the past 3 years and now after listening to the final season of rambling and bad attempts to tie together loose ends, this was a flat out bad podcast. It‚Äôs obvious the author had no idea where he was going with the story from the end of the first season."
8,Small Town Horror,Enjoying it so far!,4,"I haven‚Äôt finished the podcast yet, but I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far. I can be kind of picky with my audio dramas, and admittedly this one didn‚Äôt immediately catch me. The very in-the-moment style of recording in early season one had some audible drinking sounds that kind of squicked me out, but the story kept me engaged. With where I‚Äôm at now in season two, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna listen to the very end because I need to know how everything resolves!"
9,Small Town Horror,Uh not sure what‚Äôs going on here,2,I‚Äôm 10 minutes in and have zero idea what this is. Sorry for the low review but mk
10,Anxiety Slayer,Zero credentials,1,"The only evidence-based tools these two have to reduce anxiety is breath work. The rest of their podcast is filled with quackery, and toxic misinformation. My favorite was their claim Covid isnt a seriously, deadly pandemic and the media has overhyped it. Compete bozos. Dunning-Kruger is alive and well. I‚Äôm ashamed to be a white woman. This seems to be widespread with my kind."
11,Anxiety Slayer,Too bad.,1,I am looking for help with my extreme anxiety and within the first 2 minutes you said this coronavirus is overhyped by the media. wow. that is reckless.
12,Anxiety Slayer,THANK YOU,5,I really wanna appreciate you for taking your time to do these Anxiety podcast . You don‚Äôt know how much you helped me over come this. It wasnt easy at all but with God by my side and with your help I was able to overcome this slowly one step a day . I have a story I would like to share with you if you don‚Äôt mind listening to it maybe it can be a good story for your podcast . Thank you again !!!
13,Anxiety Slayer,Coronavirus,5,Will you please consider addressing epidemic related anxiety? Thank you very much!
14,Anxiety Slayer,Thank you,5,"I found this podcast when I was in the thick of my panic attacks and it was the only thing that gave me peace and allowed me to believe that I would be okay again.
I thank you for all the work you do"
15,Anxiety Slayer,Just not for me,4,"This podcast is well made, has knowledgeable hosts, and good topics. Unfortunately, the topics and techniques aren‚Äôt varied enough for me. And the tone of the cast isn‚Äôt to my preference. Just a bit too dry."
16,Anxiety Slayer,Love this podcast!,5,This podcast ha shelled me tremendously throughout the years! Thank you girls
17,Anxiety Slayer,Love this podcast,5,One of the best podcast to help you cope with your anxiety. I felt like any therapist I had didn‚Äôt help me but the minute I started listening to this podcast everything I was going through made so much more since. I have been doing so much better now. It feels like group therapy and I have recommended to others to help them ease their anxiety:worrisome minds ‚ù§Ô∏è
18,Anxiety Slayer,super,5,love this podcast! the talking points are super relevant and the guided meditation and breathing exercises have been proven to be super helpful for my day to day life. definitely recommend !
19,Anxiety Slayer,Super helpful,5,I recently found this podcast and I‚Äôm SO GLAD I did. This podcast is truly SO helpful and has really helped me learn how to cope with my anxiety. 10/10 recommend to anyone dealing with anxiety.
20,Another Mother Runner,Love these women,5,"I found this podcast a few years ago when I just started running. Their wisdom, humor and support of mother runners helped this mom of two toddlers feel okay about taking time to invest in myself, persists when life got rough and feel like I have a whole group of friends in this same situation with me and they are cheering me on. I look forward to each episode. Thank you for doing what you two do. You address changing lives."
21,Another Mother Runner,The running friends I‚Äôve never had.,5,"I‚Äôve been running my entire life, but never had any close friends that enjoyed it like I do, or a running group. AMR is the first time I‚Äôve gotten to experience listening to other mothers like myself tell their experiences and it‚Äôs been amazing! I look forward to every podcast! Thank y‚Äôall for being the running ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that I‚Äôve never had!!"
22,Another Mother Runner,My favorite running podcast,5,This is my favorite running podcast. The hosts are down to earth and yet inspiring. I relate to the topics they cover and learn something every time.
23,Another Mother Runner,A Must Listen,5,"I‚Äôve listened since the beginning and the podcast just keeps getting better. Informative, fun, full of variety, and just plain real. It‚Äôs a weekly companion on my runs, and a tribe that ‚Äúgets me‚Äù as a mother runner."
24,Another Mother Runner,What more can I say?!,5,You already know I love ya!
25,Another Mother Runner,Why I love running,5,Well spoken guests who were willing to share intimate stories that were relatable. Hosts were fluent in keeping conversation and transitions smooth
26,Another Mother Runner,Thank you!,5,Podcast virgin here! I have to admit I‚Äôve never had the desire to listen to any podcasts but I was drawn to this one because I‚Äôm a mother runner. I just listened to ‚ÄúWhy I Love Running‚Äù and absolutely loved it. It‚Äôs as if they knew all the struggles I am currently going through with my own running. It made me realize I‚Äôm not the only one with doubts and struggles even though I love running. I can‚Äôt wait to listen to more!!!
27,Another Mother Runner,My favorite podcast!,5,"I have been listening for years and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never left a review. Sarah and Dimity (and now Molly, Adrienne, producer Alex and the crew!) feel like old friends that have been with me through pregnancies, postpartum and now even navigating the teen years. My running-specific training has been mixed with other exercise through the years, but the variety of advice always helps keep me moving. Thank you for the years of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù and I look forward to many more!"
28,Another Mother Runner,Early morning routines-#399,5,"Love this podcast and love what u had to say about morning routines. I felt like I did each and every one of those things just in my own way. I love to either read,mediated or journal before my run with a cup of coffee of course. That way I can let it digest to of course take my morning poop then out the door. I have 3 kids from 8-13 years old. So mornings are my everything. Before I head to work. And Hubby takes care of the kids in the morning, I‚Äôm on afternoon duty. It all works out. Thank u again for making such a great podcast that‚Äôs so relatable to moms who work and run."
29,Another Mother Runner,"Funny, informative, inspirational",5,"This is one of my favorite podcasts. I‚Äôm not a mother, but I‚Äôve been running for a few years and have learned so much through this podcast! I love the information and interviews packaged with a lot of humor and relatable stories. I probably wouldn‚Äôt still be a runner if not for this podcast and the inspiration and information I get from my weekly listens!"
30,Massage Business Blueprint,Amazing resources for all LMTs,5,I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for a couple know years now and I‚Äôm always blown away by the content and tips given by both Allissa and Michael. They are very generous with what they share and their banter is mostly hilarious. No matter if you‚Äôre a newbie or seasoned massage therapist you will learn a lot from this podcast.
31,Massage Business Blueprint,Thank you!,5,"I love Alissa and Michael! I have been a LMT for 5 years and have been running a private practice for 3 years and listening to Massage Business Blueprint for the last year. My business is more organized financially and my networking game has gotten better because of what I have learned from this podcast. I always appreciate their content because like many massage therapist I am not a natural business person. I also enjoy Alissa and Michael‚Äôs bantering! I have learned so much for Massage Business Blueprint, thank you so much for continuing to provide an excellent podcast! And I love the new 2020 podcast format!"
32,Massage Business Blueprint,Love this Podcast,5,I am 5 months out of school and 5 months into my private practice so any new advice is amazing. I recently found this podcast and I‚Äôm so pleased that I was able to find a podcast dedicated to Massage. I would love to hear a topic on retaining clients in our business. Thank you!
33,Massage Business Blueprint,üôåüèºüôåüèº,5,"I 100% believe that I would not be as far in my career, as I am in a short period of time, without having this podcast to listen to. That sounds so extreme, but it‚Äôs true üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Thank you Michael and Allissa! You're doing a great thing for our industry."
34,Massage Business Blueprint,Great massage podcast,5,"Excellent content, funny host. Thank you so much for your time."
35,Massage Business Blueprint,Excellent Massage Marketing Podcast!,5,"I‚Äôve been practicing since 2007 in an area that‚Äôs very seasonal. My goal was to increase off-season business, and by listening to this podcast and implementing their ideas I have seen real results. Thank you so much for doing this show! It‚Äôs enjoyable to listen to‚Äîand gives easy to follow advice and ideas."
36,Massage Business Blueprint,"Helpful, Motivating and Real",5,"I‚Äôm grateful to have found a podcast about the business of massage that is relevant and helpful in today‚Äôs world. Allissa and Michael are knowledgeable and personable and keep it fun. I appreciate that the episodes are brief and to the point. I feel motivated and empowered with their useful tips and information for a my small business. I can also say they will respond to your email questions. Thanks for the reply, Allissa! I‚Äôm recommending to all of my massage colleagues who want to grow and evolve as therapists and business owners."
37,Massage Business Blueprint,"Really helpful, fun",5,"The podcast and membership group have been really helpful and fun to listen to as I learn about the massage business arena (newbie here, lol). Friendly and accessible by real folks for real life situations. Thank you!"
38,Massage Business Blueprint,Inspired me to get back into massage!,5,"I got my license about 9 years ago, practiced for a little less than a year before I was too pregnant to keep massaging. I have been doing the corporate thing, but have maintained my license in the hopes of someday getting back into massage. I have been thinking more seriously about it in the last year, but have been nervous about all the catching up I have to do and wondering how I can make the transition. This podcast has me committed to making a career change AND because of all the awesome content, I feel confident that I can succeed!! Thank you so much for putting together this amazingly informative and fun podcast!!!"
39,Massage Business Blueprint,Very helpful,4,"I‚Äôve been a massage therapist for 9 years and a massage instructor for 7 years. In the last 2 years I‚Äôve become very connected with audio learning. It started with some basic podcasts and recently I drafted doing audible.com too. I always wanted to be a reader but never learned well that way, I set a goal and this year I listened to 20 full length educational books in 2018 and am subscribed to 8-10 podcasts too. I oddly never thought of looking to see if there were massage podcasts. I listened to lots of business books but finding this podcast recently and having information specific to my field has been awesome. They both do a great job, I connect more with Michael but they both bring great insight."
40,That Paleo Show,Enjoyable Wellness Information,5,"The hosts are easy to listen to. They are informed without being so technical that you tune out. They present quality information in enjoyable manner. Excellent guests are interviewed with questions that help the listeners gain better understanding.
This podcast is a new favorite!"
41,That Paleo Show,Sound advice...that sounds good!,5,"Dr. Brett Hill is informed, knowledgeable, and fun. His interview style is so relaxed and easy to listen to. Finally, nutrition advice that's easy to swallow! Keep up the good work!"
42,That Paleo Show,Find the Mute Button,1,"I am sorry, but I just can not listen to one more episode of this guy clearing his throat and blowing his nose. don't you have a button to mute that?"
43,That Paleo Show,LOVE!!!!,5,"I just listened to your podcast for the first time. I found ""Well, What About Alcohol?"" and fell in LOVE! Yours is the only paleo podcast that tells the straight story. There are SO MANY mixed messages out there: In other podcasts I hear the message ""Grains are BAD. They will KILL you!"" in the same show as ""Alcohol... in moderation... use it on a cheat day...it's bad, but..."" I like your unequivocal stance. It makes so much sense!!! Alcohol is a NEUROTOXIN. It's SUGAR. It's POISON. End of story. I especially loved your answer to the justification of ""wine with dinner""...you're right! It's no more ""acceptable"" than ""dessert after dinner"". You are right on. I am a BIG FAN! Keep up the intelligent work!!!"
44,That Paleo Show,"She'll Be Right If You Listen To ""That Paleo Show!""",5,"There's a reason why this podcast has instantly become the #1 health podcast in Australia since it debuted in February 2013! It's THAT good. Dr. Brett Hill, Dr. Janah James and Stephanie Waswylyk have perfect chemistry together and you can tell they love and appreciate each other's presence. Of course, it doesn't hurt that they all work together in a chiropractic clinic in Adelaide, Australia.
The rise in interest with low-carb, Paleo and primal diets in the past few years makes ""That Paleo Show"" the PERFECT podcast for you to listen, learn, absorb and change your life. Take a listen and see what I mean. She'll be right (paying homage to my Aussie friends) if you make this podcast a regular part of your life!"

56,Optimal Performance Podcast,Life hack blessings,5,I absolutely love this podcast! You are an inspiration and I cant thank you enough for all the life hacks you share. Blessings friend ‚ú®
57,Optimal Performance Podcast,My favorite podcast for endless reasons!,5,"Sean is incredible! He's engaging, intelligent, thoughtful, open minded, and one of the few teachers I have come across who challenges my knowledge and is helping me level up in life. My mind has been blown after every episode, which is pretty hard to do! Don't miss a single episode üôå"
58,Optimal Performance Podcast,Don‚Äôt end this,5,An absolute wealth of information presented from a wonderful man interested in giving the best to all of his listeners. Love the podcast please keep it going brother if it all possible. I love you to for putting out all the information for free to all of us. Take care
59,Optimal Performance Podcast,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Sean, host of the Optimal Performance Podcast, highlights all aspects of health, fitness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
60,Optimal Performance Podcast,Love the content!!!,5,Super meaningful. Great guests.
61,Optimal Performance Podcast,"Fun, interesting, and informative",5,"I'm so impressed with the wealth of knowledge that is continuously shared on the OPP. Every week, I am so entertained by the information that is shared by guests/experts."
62,Optimal Performance Podcast,Not thinking about his audience,3,"The people interviewed on the podcast are quite good and interesting, but so many of the questions end up being things that just Sean wants to know. As an example, he interviewed someone about how to eat and exercise for three body types. Once the interviewee got through Sean‚Äôs body type (which was only the 2nd one discussed), he got completely sidetracked from there and never got to the 3rd type."
63,Optimal Performance Podcast,The Missing link between professional Success and personal happiness,5,"Many podcasts out there (specifically in business) Focus on the big things and the stories and how to get investers and grow your brand etc etc. But for someone just starting out, one thing you do have control over is your little habbits and what you define as personal success. This podcast is refreshing in that it humanizes issues everyone faces and provides helpful advice to make your health, mentality, career, and personal life better for you and everyone around you. Definitely take a listen at this podcast if you haven't before"
64,Optimal Performance Podcast,Great info,5,Loving the episodes I have heard so far. I especially enjoyed the July 2017 debating vaccines episode. Thank you for your investigations.
65,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Authoritative without being preachy,5,"I am huge fan of podcasts, particularly the paleo/primal genre. However, I've had to delete several that cross the line between informative and preachy. Nora, on the other hand, provides in-depth information and applicable tools to empower people to find their own path to living their best life. She does this in a respectful way that validates the notion that there are many different approaches to living primal. I always learn something new and feel lifted up in the process. Thank you"
66,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Thank you!!,5,Thank you for putting out a podcast that cuts through the chase and tells it like it is. I first heard you on 180 Nutrition and downloaded as many as I could from this site. I like your research on Statin Drugs and how harmful they are to people. As a Clinician myself ---- I am better educated because of your hard works. Thank you!
67,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Lousy audio.... host calling on a phone?,1,"come on, the host is calling from a lousy phone? you got to be kidding.
I can't listen to this."
68,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Please come back Nora!,5,I love this podcast and sometimes go back to listen to the episodes. GREAT info!!!
69,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Thyroid episode,2,"Disappointing that they only talked about low thyroid. High thyroid was ignored except in passing. Plus, so many annoying ""breaks"" that I will not listen to more of these podcasts."
70,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,My only complaint is that there are no current episodes.,5,I've listened to most of these twice! Nora was my introduction into paleo nutrition and fitness. I read her book in 4 days while on vacation at the beach and came home only to discover a growing subculture of Paleo/Primal emerging. I have read almost all the paleo related books and I am very glad I read Nora's first. Her podcasts have great guests and interviews (i especially love the one with Lierre Keith) and like I said my only complaint is that she is no longer putting out new episodes...
71,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Exceptional Podcast!,5,"I have listened to every podcast, read her book and am now seeing John Anderson at the Minneapolis Nuerotherapy Institute to try neurofeedback. There are some podcasts that are just people spouting some basic nutritional information with maybe a personal account of weight loss, but that is not the case with this one. Every podcast is loaded with valuable information. I wish she was still doing them, but I believe you will find this of great value. Everyone that I have turned on to this is blown away. Check it out."
72,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Love this Lifestyle!,4,"After being exposed to dozens of informative episodes, I changed my lifestyle from a bodybuilding low-fat diet to a higher-fat primal way of eating. Was I amazed by the results? I even bought the book after it was on my wish list for several months. Though I am not a fan of the neurofeedback discussions, I LOVE the nutritional segments. I hate the commercial breaks, though."
73,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Gedgaudis is one smart woman,5,"I have read dozens of diet and nutrition books, and Primal Mind, Primal body is one of the best. Is heavy on detail which I value."
74,Primal Body Primal Mind Radio,Fantastic!,5,"I loved Nora's podcast. I stumbled upon it from Robb Wolf's podcast and assumed it would be exclusively diet related. However, much to my surprise I found out about neurofeedback along with diet information. This is interesting stuff. I hope Nora will do something like this again in the future and until then we will all just have to revisit the existing episodes. THANK YOU"
75,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Tip of the Spear,5,"I‚Äôve known Zach now for more than 10 years. He‚Äôs been a coach, mentor, and most importantly a friend throughout that time. His no BS philosophy is what attracted me to his methods way back in 2006. His podcasts are sweet nuggets of knowledge and insights into his and others methods across the world! Can not recommend this podcast more."
76,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,No BS,5,"Zac delivers information this world needs! Back to the basics! Bulldoze the BS! No fads or gimmicks here. If you enjoy the work, the journey, the training, this podcast is for you. If you want to be handed everything on a platter, keep scrolling social media."
77,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,"Cuts through the BS, gets you fired up!",5,"As a personal trainer and sports performance coach, I cant recommend this podcast enough. Zach cuts through the fads and gimmicky stuff you see out there and explains how he gets results using proven methods and hard work. Very inspiring stuff, I love listening to it on the drive to work every morning."
78,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Awesome podcast!,5,Zach was my coach at underground for 4 months before I joined the Marines. He prepared me both physically and mentally for any obstacles I may face. After training with Zach I was in the best shape of my life. His knowledge and wisdom is unlike any thing I‚Äôve experienced. I now have 2 sons who I will be having train with Zach once they are old enough to start competing.
79,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Strongcast is inspiring!,5,Always provides excellent content and motivation. Really appreciate all that Coach Zach does.
80,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Real and Raw Knowledge,5,Strong Life Podcast gives you real and raw knowledge from years of experience. There‚Äôs no sugarcoating. Just giving you what you need to kill it in life and in the gym.
81,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Blue Collar!,5,"Love listening to ZEE because he is all about doing the work. It reminds me of where I grew up - a small, farming community where you knew you just had to do the work whether you liked it or not. This podcast cuts through the noise and fluff and tells you like it is!"
82,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Strength for life,5,"When my ex wife and I started the divorce process several years ago, I emailed Zach and asked for some advice. Aside from telling me not to sulk, he recommended a few podcasts including this one. Later I got full custody, and the challenges of childcare and housing inundated my world. At the moment I didn‚Äôt realize it, but in retrospect, I owe much of it to Zach‚Äôs emails and podcasts that made me stronger all around."
83,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Five Stars,5,"I‚Äôve been down to Z‚Äôs gym a couple times in the past couple of years - it‚Äôs only a 90min drive for me !!
But I‚Äôm always reading the Blog
Listening to the podcast
And as I start my journey in BJJ - his teachings are more relevant more important than ever before
Thanks so much z !!!!!!!
Thank you
Thank you"
84,The Zach Even - Esh STRONG Life Podcast,Great hardcore podcast,5,Old school hardcore training and mentality with new school science
85,Live Awake,Nice to hear your voice again,5,Each and every one of your podcasts resonate with me!
86,Live Awake,So happy you‚Äôre back,5,Thank you so much for sharing with us again. I‚Äôve missed you and have listened to past episodes over and over to aid in my daily centering. I appreciate you and your message so much. Thank you thank you again for sharing with us again.
87,Live Awake,You have permission- to love this podcast!,5,"After a 3 year hiatus, I was so delighted this podcast was back! This podcast is calm and soothing and somehow everything I need to hear every time I listen. I feel blessed and peaceful after each episode. Thank you!"
88,Live Awake,The most beautiful,5,"I discovered this ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù (in quotes because it‚Äôs so much more than that) exactly when I needed it and I am carefully making my way through every episode, one each day. In the quiet of the early morning I find myself waking up with a sense of anticipation of turning inward for the first time. I haven‚Äôt been able to find a meditation or practice that‚Äôs easy to continue until now. I simply listen to them and write down what speaks to me or just let the words do the work and write nothing at all. I am overjoyed to see that Sarah has resumed after what seems like a long break, and hope that she will keep creating them. Regardless of when they were recorded or how I listen, each ‚Äúepisode‚Äù is poignant and applicable and I know that I can make my way up and down and back up the list of episodes again and again ‚Äî discovering something new that speaks to my soul each time. Thank you, Sarah, for putting such beauty into the world and directly into my heart with your words. These are such a gift and I am sharing them with everyone I know, especially today, when they are as true as they‚Äôve ever been... but we are all more open to receiving them."
89,Live Awake,My heart just got happy,5,I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre back. Needed now so very much. Thank you thank you thank you for bringing back your light.
90,Live Awake,Best Meditation,5,"Oh how I‚Äôve missed you. I‚Äôm so glad your are back. Your voice and words are always beautiful, and help me feel so much more at peace. Hope you have been well. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

115,Brain Over Binge Podcast,Real Help,5,This podcast is real information that is helpfully healing my issues with food. I have listened to all the back episodes which have been transformational and user friendly. I like the common sense and realistic attitude.
116,Brain Over Binge Podcast,A godsend,5,This was truly revolutionary for me. This was life altering. This was my answer.
117,Brain Over Binge Podcast,Binge eating,5,I learned new information that was helpful.
118,Brain Over Binge Podcast,Honest.,5,"For anyone looking to recover:
I am a 21 year old male who has struggled with body dysmorphia, bulimia, binge eating, as well as habitual over eating for upwards of 7 years. All of which I believe are a result of restrictive eating, ‚Äúdieting‚Äù, and rigid workout regiments with no clear instructions or boundaries of genuine self improvement. If you are looking to give a new approach a try I would HIGHLY recommend studying these podcasts as you would any other educational course. In my experience, taking notes in conjunction with multiple replays of each episode was a huge factor in instilling the value of what can be taken from the lessons‚Äî as well as reaffirming just how false the urge to binge is (generally and in the context of experience an urge or binge episode). There is a very high ratio of quality content to self promotion in this series."
119,Brain Over Binge Podcast,The older woman ruins it,2,If this was just you speaking on this topic I would listen but everytime it moves to cookie I have to skip forward because her voice is so hard to listen to.
120,Brain Over Binge Podcast,üåüSaving Graceüåü,2,"Karen and Cookie...I have been stumbling over roadblocks for over a year trying to help my teenage daughter find a way to the end of her B.E.D. It has been an incredibly difficult, tumultuous journey that never seems to come even close to ending. I thought I knew everything there was to know about this
dis-ease after countless hours of research and attempts to find the right kind of ‚Äútherapist‚Äù-but I now know how wrong I‚Äôve been and how much of a tight grip the world of therapy has on eating disorders. I feel as if my efforts to educate myself have been lost efforts because nothing seems to help no matter what the cost,both financially and emotionally. That is, until I discovered your podcast!! I have no words for the level of gratitude I have for your precise and clear way and educating and directing people towards recovery. I‚Äôm only just starting to listen to your episodes and already feel a sense of relief and hope that I have not experienced yet on this journey. My daughter has always claimed that it is something wrong with her brain and that is why it‚Äôs happening, because she says she really truly does not feel like she has control over her choices when it comes to binging... like something inside her brain is controlling her. Finding something that explains what‚Äôs happening in the brain in relationship to this disorder is absolutely the perfect tool for her recovery! Funny thing, I was about to enroll my daughter into an eating disorder clinic when I found your Podcast and now I am second-guessing that choice, as I am sure they will just try to find and over analyze what it is about her past that she‚Äôs trying to ‚Äúcope with‚Äù through BED. I wish I had discovered you sooner as I know you just began a course. (I‚Äôm going to check out your website to see when the next course begins). There are no words that could possibly level up to the amount of gratitude I have for your wisdom and your willingness to share it. I am beyond grateful, as is my daughter. It‚Äôs as if we have been covered in a cloak of darkness and despair and your words and wisdom have lifted it off of us and we can see the lightüåü
Thank you so very much üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ"
121,Brain Over Binge Podcast,New discovery...,5,"Kathryn
YOU....ARE....AMAZING!!!
I have just discovered you, of course the universe brought your podcast into my world, I can‚Äôt even remember how I came across it!
I hear your podcast it literally feels like The words you share about your story are talking about me.
Thank you for shining your beautiful light to those that need.
You are appreciated greatly dearest!üíúüôèüèΩüòå"
122,Brain Over Binge Podcast,After a binge today I need to relisten,5,"By listening to this show over the past couple months my binge episodes have gone WAY WAY down, but I still have so much work to do as tonight I went insane on some donuts. I need to get back to the basics and realize the faulty wiring of my brain leading me down the wrong isles at the grocery department and how to break the vicious cycle. But I believe it is possible with tips from this show"
123,Brain Over Binge Podcast,Too much self promotion,2,"While the information they were presenting was good, literally half of each podcast is about them self-promoting their books. Additionally, when they actually *are* talking about the content, they repeat themselves to where maybe 2 to 3 minutes of each podcast actually contains helpful information."
124,Brain Over Binge Podcast,Heart medicine,5,Speaks my heart language
125,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Listen with an open heart,5,Not for those who need a lot of coddling. Fierce personal truths and decades of experience and research are shared. The callers are real and the exchanges between them and the hosts are often heartbreakingly tender. Great work ladies!
126,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Nope,1,Verbally assaults. Don‚Äôt listen.
127,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Vital information for health,5,Susun knows so much not only about herbs but about how to live in a more holistic organic manner. She is a force for good for every living thing in these increasingly dark times. I don‚Äôt mind that she is crotchety at times ‚Äî it is kind of funny and besides as a crone she is more than entitled to these lively outbursts.
128,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Love Susan ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,5,"I really appreciate her direct, no nonsense style of answering people‚Äôs questions. She has wisdom we can all be open to learn from. Her style of communication can be difficult to handle for those with sensitive ego‚Äôs. She is human and isn‚Äôt the end all be all of facts. Meaning she isn‚Äôt perfect and doesn‚Äôt have answers to everything.
Her books are excellent!!"
129,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Wildly inconsistent,1,"I heard the episode last week where Ms. Weed launched into a rant praising vaccines and placing anyone who questions their safety into a flat earth / conspiracy theory category? What? I then listened to a show recorded in 2017 with Time Monk Radio where Ms. Weed calmly, rationally presented her research on the dangers of vaccines and stated that she herself has never had a flu shot! What‚Äôs going on here? If you‚Äôre going to dish out health advice, please be consistent."
130,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Agro Herbalism,2,"Liver Heat is real. Thanks for the reminder by your behavior, Susun."
131,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Mixed,3,Tons of great info on this podcast but JEEZ could Susan be any more condescending and rude to people? Sometimes it makes me so anxious I have to stop listening.
132,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,So much knowledge...so hard to listen,3,"Susun‚Äôs gifts are also her biggest weaknesses. She holds women accountable and shows them how they keep themselves small, but she often becomes berating. She refuses to interact with people‚Äôs self-defeating defense mechanisms, but she shames them for not seeing what she can (I mean, who sees themselves clearly all the time?!). She imparts SO MUCH useful knowledge, but she isn‚Äôt terribly curious about what others have to offer. She wants women to be strong, but she reinforces pretty pathetic people-pleasing behavior in her callers.
I don‚Äôt think Susun has been challenged enough in a real and powerful way (social media calling out isn‚Äôt gonna cut it). She has touted the benefits of non-violent communication, but gets hijacked by her limbic system whenever someone is annoying her and she goes full nuclear.
It‚Äôs sad, because she has so much to offer. I love her teachings, but the podcast is often cringeworthy."
133,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Oh jeez,1,"I like to peruse the ol‚Äô iTunes Store for new podcasts, and happened to stumble across Susun‚Äôs show. I‚Äôve been a proponent of herbs in the past; I‚Äôve taken raspberry leaf tea like the best of ‚Äòem.
But I was listening in to the October 21 show. The first caller complained of major constipation and abdominal pain. As an aside, she listed off herbs she took for sleep, including poppy seed.
Now, I‚Äôve seen ‚ÄúTrainspotting.‚Äù I know that any and all poppy products and opiates have a tendency to cause constipation and, in some cases, serious abdominal pain and/or gastric bezoars. But, through either ignorance or sheer not-listening, Susan didn‚Äôt seem to notice.
This is a long way of saying WOOF. I hope that caller gets the help she needs, though it probably won‚Äôt be from Susun."
134,Ask Herbal Health Expert Susun Weed,Saddened by Susun's Behavior,3,"I am shocked at how poorly Susun treats her followers/callers. These are the very people that allow her to exist on this platform. If she continues to treat every caller like they're a dimwit, she will have no one to listen or call on her before long. Talking over people, dissmissing their thoughts or concerns, rude crude responses...leave that to Howard Sterns of the world. Why have a show like this when she clearly has little deisre to speak with or educate those who are beneath her level of knowlege or skill? As a person who has studied human behavor most of my life, I strongly suggest she stick to writing books and allow the heart centered, knowledgeable beings around her to respond to the followers and callers. She's too high and mighty for her own good, her behavior on this VERY PUBLIC platform is a detriment to her life's purpose and work. I'll end by saying that I absolutly love Susun Weed and her work in this world, but I can't listen to her treat her loyal followers so poorly."
135,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Finally I Get It,5,I have been working on recovery for a couple of years an you are helping me get it. It‚Äôs not my fault. I can be more compassionate with myself and be angry with the way the media has made me feel less than. I just signed up for your You on Fire program and I can‚Äôt wait to work with you. You Rock!
136,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Makes you dig deep,5,"Thank you Summer! I have been listening to your podcast for a couple months now. The episode that really hit me in the feels and made me dig deep inside to figure out what in the world is going on with me, was the comparison episode. WOW! I never realized how much I do compare myself to others. I appreciate that you give us tools to use to try to figure out how to navigate our feelings in every episode.
If you are looking for a clear cut, no BS podcast that gives you not only scientific evidence on why we behave the way way do, but also give you the tools to navigate these topics, Summer‚Äôs podcast is for you!"
137,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Be prepared for some feels,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to Summer‚Äôs podcasts for about 3 months. Be prepared for her to bring up a lot of feelings that are deep inside ....it can lead to a good cry every now and then if you‚Äôre being real with yourself. As I‚Äôm turning 50 this year, I‚Äôm trying to find a way to finally stop being so darn mean to myself and to start finding the courage to say that I am enough. I feel like she‚Äôs speaking right to me, and between her podcasts and IG/FB posts, she always manages to say just what I need to hear when I need to hear it. I‚Äôm not there yet on my journey, but Summer‚Äôs well is a critical tool for the effort."
138,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Really needed to hear this!,5,Thank you so much. Have learned SO much already and you are helping me start my journey to get rid of being in a restrictive mindset and loving my body no matter my weight. I have been feeling really hopeless lately but your podcasts make me feel like there is hope!
139,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Amazing introduction to change your life,5,If it wasn‚Äôt for Summer‚Äôs podcast I would have never been introduced to intuitive eating and HAES. I am so thankful for all of the information and resources she provides in these podcasts. I always look forward to new episodes!!
140,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Fabulously empowering,5,"I have listened to all of the episodes and love how it‚Äôs evolved. From the beginning, Summer has empowered women to live their authentic lives in authentic bodies. Fabulous listen for any/all women!"
141,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Really Great Podcast,5,"I‚Äôve just started being interested in making peace with my body and food and seeing diet culture for what it really is. It‚Äôs a lot to unravel. I am so glad I found Summer.
Summer‚Äôs style is very positive and upbeat, and I believe her - she knows her stuff. Also, she has a very pleasing voice , and that‚Äôs a plus - sometimes podcasters have voices that I find annoying. I‚Äôm enjoying learning from Summer, and really like the series she‚Äôs got on now. Thank you, Summer!!"
142,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism","Fun, interesting and needed!",5,"I really enjoy listening to Summer smash diet culture and the incessent need that women feel to be smaller. I've listened to many of them, but most recently the ones on body image are wonderful!"
143,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",It‚Äôs like hearing my best friend speak,5,I am a brand new listener to this podcast and in the beginning stages of rejecting diet culture. Finding this podcast has really struck a cord inside. Summer‚Äôs choice of words and phrases are those that make me feel as though she is one of my oldest friends and talking to me in a way that I don‚Äôt feel lectured. Love this so much - thank you.
144,"Fearless Rebelle Radio with Summer Innanen - Body Image, Body Positivity, Self-Help, Feminism",Love this podcast,5,The messages of this podcast are so important and needed. Thank you for the work that you do. You change lives and make the world a better place.
145,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Brian, host of The Great Love Debate podcast, highlights all aspects of relationships, life changes and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
146,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Love Brian!,5,"I sincerely enjoy Brian‚Äôs ‚Äúno-BS‚Äù clear cut advice. Not to mention how his sense of humor never fails to make me laugh out loud.
Great podcast for the single ladies out there!"
147,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Shallow discussions,2,"Maybe you can find gold nuggets every now and then, but for a vast majority of the time nothing is really said. They have a lively mannerisms, and are well suited for voice podcasting, but there is no content, or meat; just little snippets of opinions and sometimes facts.
A representative episode to see what I am talking about would be the ‚Äú23 questions‚Äù episode. Everything is surface layer here, and I almost always review positively for things, but I just can‚Äôt for this one. I would take this as advice for host because everyone really does have good podcasting personalities. This is something fixable."
148,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Well worth subscribing to this show.,5,"Highly recommend.
I LOVE this show & Brian Howie continues to give me hope that I will find the right relationship and figure out what my version of ‚Äúhappy‚Äù will be.
We don‚Äôt have to settle,
we can all make a change that can lead to the future we choose -not just what others push on us."
149,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,"Insightful, Humorous",5,"Brian‚Äôs take on dating and relationships is always so insightful. I love the guests and the humorous takes on love and dating.
Definitely worth a listen for anyone trying to navigate dating."
150,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,"Insightful, Intelligent, and integral to dating today!",5,"I attended a live show and enjoyed it so much I now listen to the podcasts. Never stop making love, Brian!"
151,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Can‚Äôt stop listening,5,"I am such a huge fan of this podcast- I randomly saw the GLD in nyc and listened to a podcast afterwards and I liked it so much I binged and listened to every single GLD podcast.
Everyone on the show (Brian, his producer Keiko, all the guests) has interesting things to say and they are all just very likable. It amazes me how they constantly find important/relevant topics and have a variety of ways of discussing things (I.e. their ‚Äúworst date or first date‚Äù game). Brian is very wise and I often times find myself writing down lines he says and texting them to friends to help them- sooo many nuggets of wisdom on this show. He said something brilliant about closure in his last show and it‚Äôs the most helpful thing I have ever heard and I replayed it about 20x, that‚Äôs how smart it was.
I am very grateful for the existence of this podcast and I can‚Äôt wait to hear more episodes! Love love love the Great Love Debate."
152,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,Dating tips,5,Thanks for the great tips !!!
153,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,"Entertaining, I Guess",3,"This podcast is totally shallow, superficial, vapid, and cynical. To be fair, I think the appeal of this podcast is that it's shallow, superficial, vapid, and cynical. It's entertaining now and again, but I wouldn't take it too seriously as some type of dating gospel or anything. Brian Howie definitely has some good advice from time to time, but there are far, far better resources for modern dating than this podcast. I give it three stars. It's laugh-out-loud funny once in a blue moon and easy to listen to, but boy does it sour a person on wanting to put themselves out there and date. Read something like If the Buddha Dated or some such thing instead--something softer and gentler. Brian Howie and his guests can be brutal, kind of like dating apps."
154,The Great Love Debate with Brian Howie,"Funny, and educational",5,"This is the best podcast for dating and relationships! GLD helps single men and women overcome hyper judgmental perceptions, while being entertaining, and educational‚ô•Ô∏è Love these guys!"

156,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,Love it. Do more!,5,"I know you guys have a lot going on with SiF but this podcast is great too, in tht you really model all of the advice you give on SiF. To me it's great to feel like I have couple friends that are like me and my husband. We are not out as swingers to our friends and it's nice to hear another couple talk the way we do and just have non vanilla thinking. I love kissers and jades dynamic and I wish you the best. Do some more BTW :)"
157,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,COOL WISH U WOULD DO MORE!,5,Love this show wish there could be more.....
158,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,"Talking in a bath, about good things...",5,"Relaxed discussion with good thoughts, advice and information. Works well with the Sex is Fun podcast."
159,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,I love BathTalk!,5,"I started listening to BathTalk because of my fondness for Sex is Fun, Kidder's other podcast. As in that show, Kidder is the driving force behind this podcast, and he has an undenyable charisma that makes every subject fun. Jade is a calming counter to him who's no less informed or honest. There is a genuine affection between these two that never turns into hokeyness and that serves to reinforce the idea that relationships can be loving, open, fun, and intimate. While I'm not married and I mainly came to this show for the sex advice (as other reviewers have said, the ""Incompatible Sex Drive"" episode is a real lifesaver), I've found myself really enjoying the gamut of topics covered, from sexy vacation destinations to why one should make scrapbooks. Trying this podcast on a lark has become a case of getting more than I bargained for and loving it."
160,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,Sound Advice....,5,I find myself missing the wisdom of Kidder and Jade. My husband and I really enjoy listening to the good advice that they have to give. We wish they would update more regularly.
161,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,A Perfect Education tool,5,Eventhough Kidder and Jade don't do a lot of podcasts the ones they do a a perfect Education tool. They are both highly edgucated and their married with kids and a rocksolid marriage. You want to learn about relationships and stuff this is a necessity. This Tool is free..So why are you reading this go subscribe and get all the episodes. THANK_YOU guys! Life's dirty take a bath!
162,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,Disparate sex drive advice was superb,4,"Before I express my thanks, I have to say those kids breaking into the bathroom at 11 p.m. to get into the limelight is too cute. The episode that you did about partners and different sex drives was of more use than any advice column I've come across. I found myself saying, ""Oh, that's exactly like us,"" and ""Oh my god, other people have this problem, too?"" throughout your show. Even if I never implement any of your suggestions, it's good to know I am not a freak for having a twenty-something's sex drive while my boyfriend has a thirty-something's sex drive, ie, he's not as sexual. Mahalo nui for taking the time out of your busy schedule to share an intimate moment and sage advice with other couples trying."
163,Bathtalk with Jade & Kidder Kaper,"A Fun, Little Podcast",4,"Okay, so it's a super-simple format (a husband and wife take a bath together and chat) that sounds lame on paper, but give it a chance. In this case, the two ""hosts"" make all the difference. They made me realize that a lot of the things I'm experiencing in my own marriage are perfectly normal. This podcast has been a help and an inspiration for which I am quite grateful. Keep up the great work, guys!"
