0,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Fun and thought-provoking!,5,"This podcast is such a joy to listen to. I‚Äôm one of those gals who loves changing things up in my home fairly often, so the tips on this podcast are always relevant! I love how these ladies get the creative gears turning in my mind, and help me think outside of the box. I‚Äôm proud of my home, and love the compliments I get when people visit. Don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt keep you ladies as my little secret, I tell my guests I have help! Haha. Thanks for the fun, creative and practical entertainment on my long commute to work. Keep up the awesomeness!"
1,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Simply the Best,5,I am moving into my first home and found this podcast while trying to figure out paint colors. I haven‚Äôt even had a chance to get through all the episodes but it has been so helpful! Thank you ladies for being so informative!
2,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Best Decorating Podcast!,5,"Love the show, very informative."
3,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Loooove these ladies!,5,I have been listening to this podcast for a few months now and I cannot put into words how helpful it has been in my ‚Äúdecorating life‚Äù. My husband and I moved into a downsize and a fixer upper. There has been more fixing up than we imagined and we became discouraged and disheartened about our home. Listening to DTT has breathed new life into my heart. The practical and inspirational tips and tricks are just what I needed to get back in the game and begin to fall in love with my home. Thank you DTT for re-energizing my creative spirit! Let‚Äôs do this!
4,Decorating Tips and Tricks,The girlfriends I want in my life,5,"To be honest, interior design is kind of intimidating. When I was growing up it seemed like a thing reserved for wealthy people. But times have changed and these ladies make it feel accessible for everyone.
They give great advice without being hoity-toity, which is what often scares me away from other interior design podcasts.
I‚Äôm a fan! And I love their company while cleaning house and doing other projects that make it look it‚Äôs best."
5,Decorating Tips and Tricks,There is no better decor podcast out there,5,If you love home decor you will be obsessed with this podcast! The ladies give great tips and tricks to work with any decor style and their chemistry makes for an instant hint! I have listened to every single episode at least once (most twice or even three times)! I have learned a lot and wish they had a new release each day because i can not find another decor podcast that can compete with this series! It‚Äôs a must listen!!
6,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Thought it was weird,5,"Thought it was weird to listen to a podcast that is about something so visual, home decorating. But the way they do their links to see the color or item they are talking about is awesome. I love this podcast. It‚Äôs so fresh. And invigorating. Jumped out of bed this morning ready to make changes in my home that has been stuck and not bringing me joy!! Thanks ladies."
7,Decorating Tips and Tricks,Learning so much!,5,"I absolutely love these ladies. I‚Äôve learned more from listening to them than to other so-called professional designers. They are so creative, practical and entertaining as well! They have so many economical ideas, my house is looking so much more beautiful than ever, and I‚Äôve hardly spent anything. I‚Äôm becoming obsessed.... in a good way! I‚Äôve been alternating older episodes, with Yvonne (who had so many great ideas) with the newer ones. They are all excellent and I‚Äôm so glad I found this podcast."
8,Decorating Tips and Tricks,"Love, love, love you guys!!!",5,"I always look forward to listening to you lovely ladies! It feels like a cozy sit down with girlfriends whenever I‚Äôm listening! You guys are hilarious, and so informative and I SO appreciate your commitment to this podcast! Keep up the amazing work!!"
9,Decorating Tips and Tricks,"I really wanted to like this, but no",1,"There are so few interior design podcasts. I was hoping that I would like this. It‚Äôs a definite no go for me. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it‚Äôs audience is not subscribing to House Beautiful or AD. The older woman seems knowledgeable. The younger woman has a horrible, shrill, head-shattering voice and very questionable style suggestions. Their chemistry is odd. Apparently they axed their other host for some reason. First and last for me."
10,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Ruby Rocks ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,"Sex-Positive, sexy voice. Educated cheerleader for sexual pleasure. Articulate, down-to-earth, knowledgeable. Ruby is making the world a better place through her work."
11,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,There‚Äôs No Place Like Home,5,"Ruby Ruby Ruby. You save lives. You change lives. You set lives on course. You save marriages and relationships. You give people validation and a sense of self, not to mention self love that transcends every aspect of their lives. People who can walk unafraid in their own skin reach out to others, love more fearlessly, feel gratitude, and offer acceptance even to what they do not understand.
Ruby has that gift of magic. You feel heard even if only your soul is speaking. She is kind, generous, witty, so very educated with flawless lovely grammar. She can talk about the kinkiest things in a manner that normalizes‚Äîbecause it all is normal. It just is, to paraphrase Ms Ryder herself.
This podcast on the deepest level is about love. All kinds of love. Love, respect, kindness, acceptance.

Thank you Ruby for such a great podcast, and from a woman's point of view, which I appreciate as a woman myself."

16,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Great Advice,5,"I've been doing this for a while, and the advice she gives is perfect for newbies. She even throws something out there that I didn't think about. She is very picky about what products she gives a nod to, so I would take her advice on equipment seriously."
17,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Life changing,5,This is a great podcast for anyone who wants to change up their sex life. You Go Ruby
18,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Podcast 86a,5,SO much great information about pegging and answering important questions. Ruby Ryder is fabulous. Such great information and such a fabulous sexy voice.

21,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Great Podcast about the acts of pegging,5,"Ruby_Ryder Is a Very Smart and down to earth lady that Enjoys pegging and loves to get the word out about it in her podcast. My wife and I Love Pegging and do it Often

Ruby, thank you for your research, honest advice and sexy frankness. btw - one of the sexiest voices you will ever hear."
25,Ruby Ryder's Pegging Paradise,Fantastic podcast,5,"Firstly, it's hard to believe that someone can do a weekly podcast on pegging! How could that work? Well, I don't know how she does it, but I'm hooked!
I just listened to many podcasts over the last few weeks, so I have a pretty good feel of the podcast. I'm going to go into withdrawals when I finally catch up and can only listen once a week.
Great voice and audio. Professional sounding. Whole podcast has a great up beat vibe. Ruby comes across as knowledgable, enthusiastic and funny.
I only wish the ""rest of the world"" would listen to podcasts. Podcasts such as these are soooooo informative.
Ruby, you are doing such a great service. Thanks for doing this."
26,Up and Vanished,Flalistener,4,"Season 2 a little confusing but hang in there. It is getting a little much with the constant self promoting by Payne. Overall, worth the time investment."
27,Up and Vanished,üôåüèº,5,This podcast is amazing! I got full body chills in S1 E13. Thank you for taking the time to dig into these crimes and trying to solve them! I couldn‚Äôt stop listening. I would recommend this podcast to anyone!
28,Up and Vanished,True crime,5,"I have enjoyed how well this true crime podcast has unfolded. I too like other listeners have theory thoughts. I hope there‚Äôs a breakthrough for Mr. Maurice who‚Äôs been working on case a long time.
This is a true crime that has wowed me. Poor Tara."
29,Up and Vanished,Host‚Äôs attitude,1,"Host‚Äôs attitude towards Brooke was horrible. Felt like I was listening to him accuse her of the crime while he sat there and yelled at her. She was doing him a favor, so why are you being rude to the woman who is giving you information that you otherwise would not have gotten? Ridiculous."
30,Up and Vanished,üëçüèªüëçüèª,5,This series is great season 1 had me on the edge of my seat the entire time üëçüèªüëçüèª
31,Up and Vanished,Best podcast ever ‚ô•Ô∏è,5,"It took me two weeks to hear them all. I loved the way Payne works and speaks, you can tell he is truly passionate about what he does. Congratulations!!"
32,Up and Vanished,Don‚Äôt bother with the bonus episodes,2,"It started out SO good!! Then it just goes on and on and on and on about nothing. It becomes nothing but boring filler to drag out more episodes. Super disappointing. I was excited for another season, but there‚Äôs nothing worse than a bad ending."
33,Up and Vanished,"Repetitive, overly drawn out, and no answers, so no reward if you persevere",1,"Listened to Season 2. Tried to be patient with all the repetition at first, but ended up having to skip whole chunks of the last half of the season because I couldn‚Äôt stand it after a while. I suppose if you are learning English as a second language, the repetition might be helpful, but to a native speaker it is just boring and frustrating, especially as in the end there is no solution to the mystery. Waste of time, host is annoying, seems to like hearing himself talk too much."
34,Up and Vanished,Bad host and production,2,"Payne Lindsey struggles to organize an interesting story in a compelling way. What we get is long repetitive strings of irrelevant phone call audio only interrupted by the insane amount of ads. There‚Äôs so little of interest here, and yet I know these stories could be absolutely engrossing if there was a better host who could make smarter choices on how the show is put together. I wish someone else took over this podcast. Also, someone get this man some radio training, the way he talks and pronounces some words gets grating over time."
35,Up and Vanished,Irrelevant detail,2,"Started out ok, but then got blogged down with episodes recounting long phone conversation that proved to be irrelevant. I became bored with it quickly."
36,Up and Vanished,Really!,1,Started out good then he got a big head. He solved nothing. I am fine with ads and some opinions but he really became arrogant about his opinions. Real journalists and reporters are slowly fading to people like him who think their opinions are the only ones. Opinions are not facts. Then when they get a TV deal they abandon their original audience and forget where they came from. Gonna have to unsubscribe because I could care less about TV and dint want the updates anymore.
37,Up and Vanished,Ads,1,"Ads, self promotion and obviously just used this platform to get on TV, and not that it has is straight garbage. Season 1 was ok though."
38,Up and Vanished,Love it,5,I have listened to it all. I am craving more! You should investigate the disappearance of Don Lewis. (Since the tiger king is so popular right now I‚Äôm sure everyone would love to listen!)
39,Up and Vanished,Pretty good!,5,Love this podcast!
40,Up and Vanished,Good,4,Still on season one but am liking it so far. It could be condensed better though to fewer episodes but it‚Äôs good so far. I would recommend it
41,Up and Vanished,Great work! One constructive criticism,4,"is that I believe this story could have been completed in half the season.
Thank you for your time and dedication!!"
42,Up and Vanished,He didn‚Äôt solve anything.,1,"So he spent hours of repetitive poor reporting focalizing the story of a woman‚Äôs murder around him, then takes credit for solving it in spite of none of the information he ‚Äúunearthed‚Äù being even remotely related to the person who did it?? There‚Äôs like a ten minute montage of people praising him and he did nothing? Is this actually performance art exposing the exploitive nature of true crime podcasts because that‚Äôs what it feels like."
43,Up and Vanished,Downhill,2,"Repetitive, not interesting. Missed the old days when one case was followed in depth."
44,Up and Vanished,Next Thursday can‚Äôt come fast enough!,5,Great investigation and delivery of the facts. Can‚Äôt wait for next week to hear the next installment.
45,Up and Vanished,Too white,3,"Yall have covered 7 cases now and they‚Äôve all been young white women. They‚Äôre important and compelling cases, and the coverage is good and the production quality is good, but FFS does no other demographic go missing? How about you cover some POC, trans folks, disabled folks, elderly folks?"
46,Up and Vanished,Love this crime podcast,5,"My sister recommended this to me because I love crime shows and well (Coronavirus) took over my social life. I listened to Season 2 first & I'm finishing Season 1 as we speak. Such good content!
Thanks Payne!"
47,Up and Vanished,Downhill,2,"I enjoyed this podcast while it was still a primary form of content. Had too many advertisements and some strong opinions from the host, but was good overall.
Really hate the new format where the podcast is just a way to recap the Oxygen show."
48,Up and Vanished,Great stories! Well done.,4,Very much enjoy listening. but please refer to grown females as women not girls. Think how it would sound for you to be called a boy.
49,Up and Vanished,"Great job, but...",5,"Loved season one! And I am up to episode 6 in Season 2. The interview in the middle of episode 6 with ‚ÄúLanden‚Äù I think? Was frustrating to listen to and mostly unintelligible (to me anyway). It may have been more effective to just transcribe and have someone else re-read that interview because I could barely understand any of it. Also, starting in episode 5, the volume between various interviews and especially the commercials was VERY inconsistent and having to constantly change the volume was very distracting. Still a big fan and looking forward to seeing how season 2 ends! Great work on the reporting!"
50,Up and Vanished,"Started off great, then went nowhere.",2,"Season 1 started off great, but someone (not suspected in the podcast) was arrested. The podcast goes on and on with no information. It lasts forever, but never comes to a conclusion. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing."
51,Up and Vanished,Great story 1 needs help with volume levels,4,"Incredible work with how the team put the story together. Enjoyable narrator voices.
One big complaint‚Äî‚Äî someone needs to equalize the volume through season 2. When the advertising messages come on they are significantly louder than the podcast. It ruins the the flow of the experience when you have to constantly manage the volume."
52,Up and Vanished,Series 2 is not worth the effort,2,Cristal sounds like a flake who fell in with the wrong crowd when she should have been taking care of her daughter. Spiritual journey my a**. Just didn‚Äôt want to face up to her responsibilities.
53,Up and Vanished,I‚Äôm hooked!,5,Payne has a way of telling a story that is truly unique and so captivating. The guy has got to have some big balls to ask such direct questions to some pretty scary and sketchy people...I admire that! I would love to hear him investigate the Nicholas Barclay case...
54,Up and Vanished,Addictable,5,"First podcast? I don‚Äôt believe it! It‚Äôs so good! Intriguing, and exciting as the story unfolds in real time. I love it. The music is great, the narrator is great, the sound clips perfect. What a great podcast!"
55,Up and Vanished,Please make more podcasts,5,LOVE this podcast as well as Atlanta Monster. It‚Äôs so convenient to listen to since it‚Äôs free on Apple podcasts.
56,Common Knowledge,Filled with Diverse and Intriguing Viewpoints,5,I love this podcast and I hope that IFYC produces more episodes.
57,Common Knowledge,A Compelling & Important Podcast,5,"If you are just starting to think about Interfaith or very experienced with this work, this podcast will help expose you to descriptions of different faiths without generalizing. It's been a huge step forward for me to listen to all of these podcasts in thinking about how to begin this work on my campus."
58,Common Knowledge,A breathe if fresh air,5,What a great find! Fun commuting with informative Carr in my commute. Keep the dialogue rolling!
59,Common Knowledge,Important Podcast!,5,"This is a wonderful podcast from an incredible organization. I really appreciate Chris Stedman‚Äôs perspective, and am gratified to see the IFYC giving him and secular humanists a place in the interfaith community. I would love it for you to get on Stitcher, so myself and others can listen to you more easily!"

61,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",NOT CHRISTIAN,2,"He claims to be a Christian mystic. He‚Äôs heavily into the occult. He has a completely different Jesus. Heavily heavily gnostic.

81,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",Thankful!,5,"Spirituality is so fragile and can blow open the mind so much that darkness sneaks right in and your music, online prayer community and podcasts have helped make sense of indescribable thoughts and feelings I couldnt express at the time. They still do. The music is grounding when so much of what I have always blindly listened to is now painful. The podcast connects people in this way that is stable to hold space for the gravity of spirituality. So many thanks!"
82,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",Goes Where Others Don‚Äôt,4,Please have Jordan Maxwell on more.
83,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",Hope. Clarity. Understanding you wont get in church circles.,5,"Recently i was at a point in my life, where i was doubting everything that is God. Saying i cant mix my experience and believes of the supernatural ( extraterrestrial, etc) with the things of God. Always questioning and doubting to the point where i started noticing my faith being let go off little by little. While searching for a podcast talking about the annunaki, Truthseekahs podcast came up. Honestly what grabbed me was the animated logo lol. This is how i now know that finding this podcast was Yahshuas way of calming my doubts, and used his podcast as a platform to speak to me through Truth and all his interviewees. So im in a very personal walk now with God, but in a more spiritualy awake way."
84,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",Awesome podcast! üëçüèªüòé,5,"Absolute truth, Jesus Christ the LORD is the Savior of the world, the lamb of God that has taken away the sins of the world - ALL PEOPLE! HALLELUJAH!!! People need to here this GOOD NEWS! and believe it; not to save you from a place called hell of imagined eternal torment in fire - nowhere in the Bible! So yes you are saved yes you, not from a location but a condition of a painful life to experience a new creation life full of love peace and joy in Christ through the Holy Spirit! Praise The Lord! üôå"

It‚Äôs saved me in more ways than one. Do your thang Truth Seekah so blessed to have found you, your encouraging words and insightüíö You‚Äôre truly doing what your meant to do.."
88,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",Very enlightening,5,"It‚Äôs hard to find podcasts that lift you vibrationally, but this is one of those ones. Love love love this podcast."
89,"The TruthSeekah Podcast | Spiritual, Esoteric & Metaphysical Conversations",The Truthseekah is connected to God,5,"I found the Truthseekah podcast an instantly connected with the intro music. Then I listened to the content and I‚Äôve been listening ever since. Keeping an open mind to the variety of speakers, you might be as interested as I am. Regardless of your beliefs this podcast is a blessing."
90,Truth Be Told,Sound needs work,1,"Captain Ron is always loud, and can‚Äôt hear the guests. If I listen while driving, I have to turn the volume up to hear the guests, and then am blasted when Ron speaks. You guys need to listen to one of your podcasts through a phone. I like your show but it‚Äôs awful to listen to. You need a new mixer operator. Get the sound balanced and I‚Äôd give it 5 stars!"
91,Truth Be Told,Ernie La Pointe,5,To listen to this man speak is a true privilege. Priceless lessons. Great interviewing as well.
92,Truth Be Told,Fix the volume,2,I‚Äôd really like to listen but the volume is too low.
93,Truth Be Told,Disappointed and disgusted.,1,"First and only episode I listened to was about new evidence in the Michael Jackson case. Was hoping to hear level headed people speak of why Jackson wasn‚Äôt prosecuted sooner, however, after 2 mins discovered it was actually a disturbing example of ignorance and support of a known pediphile."
94,Truth Be Told,Pretty bad,1,"Terrible audio, host loud guest barely audible. Unlistenable. And dopey AF."
95,Truth Be Told,Not in stereo,4,Some of the audio is only out of the left side. But ether then that great podcast!!!!!‚Äôn
96,Truth Be Told,Always worth listening to,5,Always look forward to this podcast as it is varied and I always come away with new ideas to explore. Especially loved the episode on Sitting Bulls great-grandson. I learned more from that episode of the Indian culture than I have ever learned before. Great to hear first hand from someone who has actually lived with those values. Keep up the great work!
97,Truth Be Told,Sound needs work,4,"I absolutely LOVE the material. You guys do a fantastic job if feeding the side if me that my wife calls crazy. My issue is that I have had to skip some episodes because the guest is so quiet that I have to turn the volume way up. Then when you guys cut in I temporarily go deaf. I also use headphones (again, wife thinks I‚Äôm crazy), and some episodes are only in one ear. That gets annoying when I am trying to focus on the vast amounts of mind blowing information that is being put forward. I will always keep listening. I have plenty to catch up on. Please keep up the amazing interviews. I can‚Äôt wait to rub my wife‚Äôs nose in it when our neighbor is a reptilian."
98,Truth Be Told,5 stars,5,Love this podcast! Outstanding guest speakers!!
99,Truth Be Told,Great listen,5,"I am giving this podcast a 5 STAR REVIEW!!! They are interesting without being overly cheesy. Although, I am not a complete believer in all the guests they have on, I do keep an open mind and listen to what they have to say. Keep up the good work! Only negative thing I can say- wish the podcast was a little longer- 1 hour 20minutes would be perfect. JUST A NOTE:PLEASE FIX THE SOUND PROBLEMS. Sometimes up I can hardly hear the guest other podcasts I can hear the hosts. Please fix"
100,Truth Be Told,Production value is lacking,3,"Couldn't make it far enough into an episode to guage content due to volume fluctuation and other annoyances. Volume normalization is so easy to do. I heard him say we think 60,000 thoughts a day and only use 5% of our brains though...... I would bet my house someone didn't go to college and graduate, unless it was a bible college down south. The hosts are genuinely uneducated and lack critical thinking skills. Great subject matter, piss poor execution. Buy a Blue Yeti mic for each host and record with garage band and select volume normalization under master effects and it will sound five times more professional. You guys have good intentions, read up on how to do it right. I will check back in a year if you are still around. I want to like you."
101,Truth Be Told,"Decent topics, horrible audio quality!!!!",1,"I've skipped through so many of their podcasts because they don't do any kind of quality checks before they interview guests. Constantly losing callers, dropping in and out, volume fluctuations. These guys have been on since 2015 and still can't seem to get it together. Invest in some good audio equipment. On top of that their interviewing skills are just abysmal!!"
102,Truth Be Told,How hard is it...,1,"to actually care about your audio. This show sounds terrible. Volume all over the place. So m,any topics I want to listen to but can't because of how bad they sound."
103,Truth Be Told,Shut off call-in ringers when guests r talking,5,Morons kept allowing online callers to constantly ring while jim Fetzer is giving great info! Be more professional
104,Truth Be Told,great podcast,5,"i‚Äôm a new listener , and this show is one of the best ones i‚Äôve seen ..
keep up the good work guys .."
105,Truth Be Told,Wow,5,Just amazing podcast. Such beautifully crafted stories with a great flow and limited commercials. Huge selection. I‚Äôm thrilled to dive in.
106,Truth Be Told,Great show except ridiculous volume control,1,"If not for the volume difference this would be 5 stars. Great subjects and great guests, but it's impossible to listen to. The guests are so quiet I have to turn my volume up all the way to try to hear them. Then when the hosts talk, they are very loud. no other podcasts have this problem. I noticed similar reviews from quite a while ago so they must know. I don't understand why they don't fix this problem, at least if the hosts would back away from their mics it could help."
107,Truth Be Told,Content is Great,5,The content is absolutely top notch! The hosts are great! Guests are fantastic. I would give it ten stars if I could. Please keep doing this great podcast!
108,Truth Be Told,Still having audio issues?,1,"There‚Äôre bad reviews about audio going back two years, why hasn‚Äôt this been addressed!?"
109,Truth Be Told,Audio issues need to be addressed!,1,"Love this podcast, love the hosts, love the guests, love the subject matter... HATE the audio issues! I just checked the reviews to see if anyone else had brought this up and to my astonishment found reviews going back 3 years that complain about the audio! I listen to podcasts when I drive and I have to jack the volume up SUPER HIGH to hear the guests talking then suddenly my ears are blown out by one of the hosts piping in on a super loud volume. It has woken my sleeping baby up several times and made me turn off the show! Please please please fix this issue! Podcasts are my escape when my baby sleeps but if it wakes him up I can‚Äôt listen to you guys!"
110,Truth Be Told,Solid Podcast,5,"Concise, interesting, and open minded without being brain dead."
111,Truth Be Told,Awesome,4,Awesome Good info. You guys should do a follow up on RH negative blood types and the connection to hybrids / ancient blood lines

153,Beyond Reason,RIP Teddy,4,"Teddy Bart was a consummate professional in the world of television and radio. Having interviewed people like Ronald Reagan and Muhammad Ali over his many years of broadcast experience. The show will be missed, as will Teddy himself.
For those of us who are still interested in this topic a new Nashvillian has stepped up to the plate with his own show called Mysterious Matters. Look it up. It's one of the best out there and the host was even mentored by the greats like Art Bell, Ian Punnet and even Teddy Bart himself."
154,Beyond Reason,It was a good show,4,"I‚Äôm not sure what happened to Beyond Reason but it used to be a good show.
Teddy had a way about him that was reflective of Art Bell.
If you are interested in other similar shows that offer something close to Beyond Reason then I highly recommend either the paranormal podcast or the farside podcast.
Both of those shows are very good."
155,Beyond Reason,Highly Engaging,5,Podcasts worth listening too & extremely thought provoking. Thank you!
156,Beyond Reason,I relish this show!,5,"Some of the guests are so interesting and the talk so thought-provoking that I have listened to them over and over. Richard Bach, Martin Gray, Dr. Louise Mallory-Elliot, Dr. Mario Martinez and Dan Miller were definite favorites! Just wish the show was on more often."
157,Beyond Reason,"Excellent, illuminating, and thought-provoking",5,"The wide-ranging subjects for these generally metaphysical interviews are great. Great chemistry between the hosts, who take no particular line on anything, but focus on doing a good job getting the information out there. They have the courage to tackle topics so much of the media refuses to consider. A great, thought-provoking podcast. If your mind is open you are sure to enjoy this one."
158,Beyond Reason,"Great Hosts, but going too New Age",3,"I really like both the hosts of Beyond Reason, but with questionable guests like Gregg Braden and Caroline Myss this show has been positioned firmly in the intellectually soft ""New Age"". The hosts are intelligent people and I wonder if they have hard questions for some of their guests that they hold back. It's really too bad that thinking gets suspended in some of their shows."
159,Beyond Reason,incredibly thought provoking,5,I have gained so much insight to listening to these podcast. I'm surprised I'm not haviing to pay for the quality of insight I'm getting. I too look forward to each new interview. Keep up the great work!
160,Beyond Reason,"Can anyone say ""credulous""?",1,"Honestly, you could make up anything you want, call it supernatural, these people will believe it."
161,Beyond Reason,"fun, thought provoking",5,"I didn't know what to expect when I first heard this podcast out of Nashville TN....I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least! Have listened to all of the archived shows and look forward every week to the podcast. Great chemistry between the hosts. One of my favorite podcasts. Thanks!"
162,Beyond Reason,Top Rated,5,There's a diversity of subjects and interesting interviews. I'm definitely keeping up with this podcast.
163,Beyond Reason,Great show!,5,"Teddy Bart and Karlen Evins are real pros. Great guests, fascinating¬† conversation. Really intellegent content. They are on the top of my list."
164,The Yoga Hour,"This is what I call, ""real yoga""",5,I love yoga philosophy and it's openness to all other faiths. I feel like this podcasts is a great balance of everything you need to be a productive happy human Being!
165,The Yoga Hour,"LOVE the show, not fond of the Unity FM part",4,"I LOVE this show, but The Unity FM hosting is SO LOUD! Its invasive. And just as I start to wind down within the energy of the beautiful show, here comes Unity FM's super loud commercials to break up the whole energy of the show! It really drives me crazy and makes me not want to listen to the show."
166,The Yoga Hour,Inspiring,5,With each episode I learn and am inspired by the depth of conversation between Yogacharya O‚ÄôBrian and the very interesting guests that she has on the show. I listen to the podcasts when I walk and I always come home with insights and things to contemplate.
167,The Yoga Hour,"Great topics, wonderful host",5,"I've been listening to Yogacharya Ellen's show for a few years now and it never gets old. The guests are always very interesting, knowledgeable, and inspiring. I feel refreshed after listening to each episode and the flow of the conversations is usually right on! My only suggestion would be to try to even out the volume between the host and the callers. Sometimes, when a caller is speaking, I'll have to turn up the volume considerably on my headphones. But when the host answers, it can be very jarring and loud. That's all! Thanks for making such a treat to listen to!"
168,The Yoga Hour,The Yoga Hour,5,Excellent podcast with very interesting and helpful topics.
169,The Yoga Hour,"Inspired, practical and motivating!",5,"This program, offered by Yogacharya O'Brian, presents wonderful and supportive information and inspiration in a practical and useful way, the path of living yoga.
The spiritual life, studied by seekers of truth, is directly addressed in an accesable, applicable and inspired way to live the highest life possible.
It is a gift to listen to the conversations between Yogacharya and accomplished practictioners of spiritual principles, from traditions of yoga and other truth teaching traditions!"
170,The Yoga Hour,Great program!,5,Inspiring and Informing. I listen to The Yoga Hour every week and always find support for living a spiritually centered life.
171,The Yoga Hour,I love the Yoga Hour!,5,I love the Yoga Hour! I listen to it every week. I appreciate the practical applications that can be applied to everyday living. Thank you!
172,The Yoga Hour,Programming Excellence,5,"I listen to this podcast often because I find the depth of discussion fascinating and the quality of the guests enlivening. I substitute this program for music when I work out in the morning, giving me peace and fulfillment to start my day. I also find that it allows me to enjoy my time doing things like folding laundry or cleaning the house because I find myself engrossed in the discussion."
173,The Yoga Hour,Life Learner,5,"Inspiring, informative, uplifting and more! The quality of guests and topics can not be beat. I've listened to every podcast and many more than once. Hopefully all who listen will enjoy their journey as much as I."
174,The Yoga Hour,Learn to live spiritually every day!,5,"This show is such a great inspiration, and very much needed in the middle of the week! Practical spirituality for everyday living. I love it!"
175,The Yoga Hour,A very useful and inspiring message,5,... And wonderful to have on demand to access at any time!
176,The Yoga Hour,Best yoga podcast on iTunes!,5,"I you are looking for some good yoga philosophy podcasts, look no further!
Amazing topics and insight you can apply to your daily life.
Thank you, yoga hour!"
177,Spiritual Living Podcast,Always turns political,3,I've loved this podcast for years and the message used to be pure and inspiring. Now it's always mixed with politics and negativity. So unfortunate. I'll unsubscribe.
178,Spiritual Living Podcast,Fantastic,5,I love this podcast. Just the right mix of spiritual wisdom and humility. Fantastic.?
179,Spiritual Living Podcast,My soul craved this info,5,"Couldn't be happier to have stumbled on this gem. I started from the very bottom and am working my way to the present day. There is some intense Devine communication with these <3
Thanks so much for doing this guys.

180,Spiritual Living Podcast,Inspirational,5,This podcast is pure nourishment for my soul. The talks speak not only to my mind but to my heart.
181,Spiritual Living Podcast,Inspiring,5,Rev. Patrick Cameron speaks with inspiration. This podcast provides great spiritual nourishment for the week no matter what your background.
182,Spiritual Living Podcast,And so it is...,5,"I absolutely love these talks!! I am in California, yet I can hear sermons way from Canada. I am so proud of the teachings, and completely grateful for the awareness of the one and only, Divine Spirit. Namaste."
183,Spiritual Living Podcast,In our genes,5,Very inspiring. Liked that they believe spirituality can affect health but some people die despite being spiritually sound.
184,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Beautiful concepts made simple,5,"I love how non-preachy and non-judgmental everyone on this podcast is. It's astounding how I feel a real sense of ""joining"" even when I listen to episodes that aired long ago. Kudos to MiraclesOne for making this!"
185,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Wonderful podcast,5,Love this!!! My fav ACIM podcast! Thank you!
186,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Inspirational,5,Excellent way to further your understanding of acim. It would be great if Deb could tone down her voice and you could turn up the volume on participants. If I turn up volume to hear them my earbuds just about explode when Deb talks. Thanks for sharing your insights.
187,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Thank you so very much,5,"These podcasts have been a God send, definitely! I will listen to them over and over sometimes for hours. The 'lessons' I call them, also are helping with therapy I'm going to called EMDR. Sometimes when people laugh or when Deb is animated with words like EVIL it tends to hurt my ears when wearing earbuds, just FYI. Peace out, Michelle Page Kansas City, Mo."
188,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Info,5,"Hi EveryONE,
For some reason iTunes is not updating on the site the newest podcasts. Although I have experienced in my iTunes on my computer that it will update the podcasts if one is subscribed. Just right click and choose ""update podcast"". I've contacted them to find out why this is occurring. Hopefully it will be resolved soon. There are Podcasts from December and January at this writing.
Thanks,
Rev. Deb of MiraclesOne"
189,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Thank you,5,It is wonderful to have a podcast that fits in so much with my life. It's nice to be able to listen to what I need to hear.
190,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Really nice,5,Love your honesty!
191,A Course in Miracles with MiraclesOne - Putting the Principles into Practice,Inspiring!,5,"I just want to say that Revs. Deb & Paul and their friend Rev. Linda here, who has been guest hosting, are real teachers of God. They truly practice what they preach. They share so openly about their own personal experiences and are not afraid to be vulnerable, make mistakes and be truly honest. Their intimacy with the Holy Spirit is profound and something that I keep striving to work on myself. They really inspire me so, so much with their sharing. I am so grateful that I found them. They really encourage the intimate relationship with Holy Spirit and honor and respect me wherever I am in my journey. I find that refreshing with teachers these days. Too many tell you what you are doing is wrong, being judgmental and not just accept you where you are now. These folks do accept you, just as Jesus accepts us all. Amen. And thank you Paul and Deb!"
192,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Truly Honest Conversations,5,Steve is one of those interviewers who doesn‚Äôt demand that the conversation follow his pre-conceived notions and it makes the listener feel like you‚Äôre sitting there allowing a few friends to talk something out. I‚Äôm so very grateful for this podcast.
193,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,My FAVORITE podcast!!!!! Steve is a thought leader!,5,"Steve I cannot believe I haven't written a review for your podcast yet because I love it so much and have learned so much from it. I have also shared it with soooo many people who are in the process of walking through those doorways and experiencing Copernican Shifts. I especially loved your episode with Jennifer Dawn Watts and have listened to her two new podcasts. You are so insightful, authentic and always have a different way of perceiving things. You are able to articulate very difficult concepts into very user friendly terms. I was reading Falling Upward and began listening to Richard Rohr's podcast, then I found you and I have to say, yours is my new ""go to"" for spiritual depth and progressive christian teaching....didn't know that was a thing until I listened to your podcast. Thanks for helping me make sense out of the many question marks I have developed with the faith of my childhood. You are a seeker and I appreciate you sharing your journey with us! I wish I would have known about Evolve as I live in Denver. It sounded amazing!"
194,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Effective and useful information.,5,"Steve has a way of leading people without being pushy or annoying and it‚Äôs a joy listening to his thoughts and ideas.
Steve was one of the pastors at Open Door about 5 years ago and my wife and I always looked forward to his message. For some reason, Steve left Open Door and the Church was never the same. Open Door needed a man like him to take over and bring new life to it, but that wasn‚Äôt in the cards. This podcast helps fill in the empty space created when Steve and The Open Door parted ways.
Keep up the good work."
195,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,This Good Podcast,5,"I've listened to This Good Word since its inception and it just keeps getting better and better! Steve has a beautiful way of illustrating scripture, both through his own creativity, but also through clear teaching of the Bible and its original language. Steve is a unique teacher who can bend down and scoop up the dirt of life, feel it‚Äôs gritty quality, acknowledging the pain that we all face is very real. But, somewhere in that sifting process, he also sees hope, and helps his listeners see it as well. If you are new to podcasting or looking for a new podcast; listen to This Good Word!"
196,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Always something new,5,Steve manages to always have something new and fresh to say that I catch myself thinking about throughout the week.
197,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Terrific!,5,"Terrific! Always relevant, always good. Thank you!"
198,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Authenticity,5,"Part of every week is spent listening to to the calm voice of Steve Wiens as he imparts love, hope, and great guests as part of his podcast. I have been introduced to some remarkable Christians who have so much wisdom to share in their stories. It is life in the 'come as you are' genre, that is refreshing in it's acceptance of the messiness where fruit is born."
199,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,An Awakening and a Beginning,5,"This Good Word came into my life at the most opportune moment and I am so grateful for the truth spoken by Steve Wiens and his incredible guests. They have legitimate conversations about life from the desert experience to the mountain top peak that are so noteworthy on the road less traveled. Steve's transparency and honesty are fresh. His knowledge of Scripture in its original languages remind me that there are meanings and references that once connected create a breathtaking view of God's unyielding love for His people. Thank you, Steve!"
200,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,My go to podcast,5,"For someone who left the church over a decade ago, I find myself coming back his podcast repeatedly. He asks genuine questions with an honestly and curiosity, that is both refreshing and normalizes my own question asking."
201,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,Encouraged to hope,5,"In Steve's blogs, sermons and now podcast, he is able to communicate truth in a calm and clear way. There is never judgement or posturing, simply love and acceptance.
He talks about living life as it actually is, and as I have listened to him over the years I am encouraged to be honest, to hope, and to not be afraid to fail."
202,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,the language of more,5,"Many of us have left church, Bible studies, or other religious gatherings with a hunger still in our bellies. There has to be more, we think. More than linear thinking and easy answers, more than the smiles of happy community, more than the dryness of a God who seems disengaged from real life.
Steve is gifted at finding the language that fills that longing with hope. There is more to God, more to the Bible, and more to us than most of us have ever imagined. I am excited to feast through this podcast, one word at a time."
203,This Good Word With Steve Wiens,A breath of fresh air,5,"Steve Wiens is the friend you always wanted, a calming voice of spiritual wisdom, empathy and acceptance. I've enjoyed his blog for years, and now, we all get to hear his voice reassuring us that we are messy and still good and everything is going to be okay. Highly recommend this to anyone on a spiritual journey looking to know and love God and self more."
204,Everyday Attraction,Great podcast,5,"This is exactly what I needed at this point in my life. I am a huge Abraham fan!! I wanna keep feeling Into the vortex !!! This podcast helps me pull myself back into alignment when I have drifted.
Shedding our older selves is such an important growing process but sometimes I get a bit lost in the process and this podcast helps me comeback to my better self!!"
205,Everyday Attraction,"Thank you, yes, more please",5,I love the way Heather brings it on home every time! Her visuals nail it for me. I wish you could go back to the hour format. 30 minutes just ain't enough. I miss Heather co-hosting!! Feeling the contrast.
206,Everyday Attraction,Start the day right!,5,"I love this show! I like to begin my day with some kind of positive message and this is perfect. A short and sweet, cheerful reminder to keep me on track. Yay!"
207,Everyday Attraction,Love!,5,I‚Äôm in love with you ladies and this conversation. Please please keep them coming. I find myself wanting more! Thank you
208,Everyday Attraction,My favorite podcast!,5,"I love this podcast and have shared various episodes with many of my friends! Thank you so much for creating a great show. I do wish the episodes were more consistent, but I understand and do like the new 30 minute format."
209,Everyday Attraction,Love the feel-good sisters!,5,"These two (Rae and Heather) are like guardian angels; their message on Everyday Attraction always seems to be exactly what I need to hear to get me back aligned with Source. The sound quality can be iffy (it used to be better, not sure what happened) but the content is always spot-on. Thank you both!!"
210,Everyday Attraction,Just right,4,I hated the Secret. I can't really listen to full length episodes of Esther Hicks. But I love listening to Rae and Heather break down the Abrahams. They get to essence of the teachings in a way that works for me. I also like that Rae and Heather don't always see things the same way. The varying perspectives are helpful.
211,Everyday Attraction,Trump --- seriously???,1,"I tried, I really did, but TRUMP political ads at the beginning of all three episodes I tried? One of the most negative, hateful, spewing figures in our world today, to lead off a podcast about POSITIVE thinking?? After jumping over to fast forward through that, the audio was so poor that it just wasn't worth the effort. Even if the content is fabulous, I just couldn't deal with repeatedly increasing/decreasing the volume just to modulate you and your guests. Bye."
212,Everyday Attraction,My Daily FEEL GOOD Ritual!,5,I am in LOVE with this podcast! I listen to the episodes over and over and just resonate so deeply with these beautiful souls sharing with such love and pure intention. Thank you Rae and Heather for sharing your light with the world and for your following your joy for lifting others up and helping others to FEEL GOOD so that they can unlock their highest potential. You are making a difference. You are heard and you are appreciated! Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!
213,Everyday Attraction,DELICIOUS STUFF,5,Love love love Everyday Attraction. Rae and Heather are masters of making the law of attraction real and applicable to our everyday life. I feel uplifted and more clear after each episode. This is my favorite spiritual podcast by far. Thank you!!!
214,Everyday Attraction,Love it,5,Thank you so much for you words.
215,Everyday Attraction,Everyday attraction,5,Really helpful easy to understand
216,Everyday Attraction,Wonderful show,5,"What a gorgeous example of ""how to"" ride the wave of source. Easy to understand, bite-sized chunks of wisdom for all of us. Each time and episode ends I am left wanting more. Thank you."
217,Everyday Attraction,Uplifting,5,"I love your show, Rae, thank you for inviting the world to your chat on the porch."
218,Everyday Attraction,Amazing show!!!,5,"I just love you & your quests. Thank you for bringing this life changing information to the ears of so many. Your podcast has truly changed my life. I am in the vortex! Lol! I'm noticing so many changes lately... I have a blissful feeling inside me almost
constantly. Things that used to hurt are seemingly clearer now & not hurtful. For example my mother in law doesn't approve of me because we are so different & always talks over me which used to hurt & anger me... Suddenly it does not even phase me. So again, Thank you so very much!
Donna"
219,Everyday Attraction,I am a big fan-,5,"Love the language, education and the pace. Yippee for me!!!"
220,Everyday Attraction,5 million stars!!,5,"I love this podcast so much, I would like to multiply my rating by a million. I found this totally by accident (if you believe in those). Excellent excellent excellent information on LOA. This is the perfect thing to listen to if you are feeling stuck in any area of your life. One episode will unstick you and get you back in the flow of things. Thank you both so much! You are changing lives!"
221,Everyday Attraction,Thank you,5,"I love this show. It is so inspiring, educational. Thank you."
222,Everyday Attraction,I listen to all of the podcasts!,5,"Great program that I hope never ends! Way to break down teachings into small, applicable lessons for living life BIG!"
223,Everyday Attraction,I get exactly what I want at exactly the right time,5,"Just a quick note to Rae and Heather: once again, I'm hearing exactly what I need to hear at exactly the right time. This is how it's been for the last dozen or so Everyday Attraction podcasts that I've listened to. ""Everything always works out for me"" is my new mantra."
224,Everyday Attraction,Wonderful,5,"Awesome!
Thanks so much for this!"
225,Everyday Attraction,retired Physical Education Teacher,5,"Absolutely love the show, love Abaham, Jerry and Esther, really appreciate what Rea and Heather bring! thank you"
226,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,To much interrupting,4,"The host keeps talking over everyone and interrupting. They need take turns speaking, otherwise it‚Äôs just a loud mess of women like I‚Äôm listening to background noise in a restaurant. When they are speaking one at a time, I enjoy the show and hearing everything the psychics have to say."
227,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Great guests... Lots of fun to listen to.,5,"The best show of its kind... Amazing guests,believable interactions and lots of laughs too...
Thanks for bringing the show back for 2020"
228,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Love this show,5,"It‚Äôs been a year since your last Pod Cast, Will there be any new Pod casts coming soon Susan? I really enjoyed all the past pod casts."
229,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,What happened here?!?,1,Are you gone?!!
230,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Good content but difficult to listen to,4,"I‚Äôve only heard a couple of episodes but so far the content is really interesting. I am how ever finding it really difficult to listen to. No offense to Susan but she sounds confused and almost scatter brained, like she can‚Äôt formulate a straight sentence without pausing multiple times. All the different psychic mediums that she has on the podcast are really good but constantly talk over each other so it‚Äôs hard to understand what they are all trying to say while talking over each other. I think with a little more structure and maybe less guest in an interview this could be a more enjoyable listening experience. All in all it‚Äôs really interesting and I enjoy the content so I‚Äôll definitely keep listening."
231,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,4,"I really enjoy this podcast, but all the negative reviews about Susan are true, she consistently interrupts and makes it about herself, she‚Äôs kinda rude."
232,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Glad you came back!,5,Was going through withdrawals for a few months! Keep up the amazing work!!!
233,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Fabulous!,5,Love your podcast! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs back!
234,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Excellent Podcast!!!!!!,5,"Susan Pinsky is smart, funny & entertaining! Great podcast!"
235,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Self absorbed Susan,2,"I want to hear what the psychics are talking about, but Susan steers the conversation to make it about her and also interjects with odd, inappropriate humor (i.e. joking about Fireball while discussing a murder case?!). Don't get derailed and focus on the subject matter and it will improve!"
236,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Great podcast!,5,Really great podcast! It's really enjoyable to listen to the readings every week. Very interesting & exciting! I especially appreciate that the fans can call in to get a reading! Thanks Susan!
237,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Caught by surprise,5,"I'm not into the whole psychic, medium, after life idea and always hoped death would be like the end of a book with no more chapters and have not changed my mind at all about that but I do seriously enjoy the show. Susan makes it funny with all her silly comments and out right laughter. Can't take life too seriously if you plan on hanging around in the here after. If your goal is to entertain I am thoroughly entertained. Keep doing what you're doing!
."
238,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Bad,1,Horrible! They could have at least got the victims name right when they talked about serial. It's Hae Min Lee! Not Han. Repeatedly said it wrong. Very annoying and disrespectful. Get your facts straight before talking about something. They were all over the place. Too many people at once.
239,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,My favorite podcast!,5,I look forward to this podcast every week. I have missed it so much! Where are you calling out?
240,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Still Deciding About Podcast...,2,"I am a new listener. The podcast is easy and interesting to listen to and I find myself waiting to listen while walking my dog. I was so involved in it that I thought my Mom would like a reading with one of her featured clairvoyants - Joshua John. Well, I paid for an upcoming appt. with him, via his website and waited for the day. Well, my credit card was charged and appt came and went, with my 86 year old mom waiting, and Joshua John never called. I called his office to ask about appointment, and never received a call back. Needless to say, it wasn't a very good surprise for my mom. She had always wanted a reading, as we have had much loss in our lives.
So, my rating for this podcast reflects this unfortunate experience. I wished there was a better outcome than having to rebuke the $70 charge. Worst of all, the non-caring, non-response of Joshua John made me think twice about Calling Out guests and their sincerity."
241,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Luv it,5,Guys go listen to Ace on the House
242,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Phenomenal!!!!,5,This podcast is absolutely amazing. It brings hope to people. I can't understand anyone who can believe in God (some stranger that looks out for us and sacrificed himself for us) but refuse to believe in spirits and psychics. I believe and all this show needs is for you to believe. Good on you Susan Pinsky!
243,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Susan Pinsky Podcasts are the BOMB!,5,"I have been listening to Calling Out for over a year, and it is the most intriguing, funny, & refreshing podcast out right now! BRAVO Playroom Podz! The psychics & mediums are the real deal. This show is so enlightening. Host Susan is down-to-earth, very funny, yet never overstepping her guests boundaries, all the while taking real callers‚Äô questions. Susan really should be on television; she is gorgeous!"
244,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Love love love,5,"I miss this podcast having new episodes. It is my absolute favorite. Every episode was interesting. I understand the cynical reviews, as I used to be a cynic myself. However, due to a series of strange events I changed my tune and this podcast led me down a rabbit hole of spiritual development. Sending a heart felt thank you to Susan and all the intuitive a that have been on the show."
245,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Love this podcast!,5,Such a fun and interesting podcast. Susan does a great job getting a variety of guests and subjects for her podcasts. I look forward to each new episode. Keep up the great work Susan!
246,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Interesting and Fun Podcast to listen to,5,"I have a psychic friend that I grew up with and I'm a bit of a skeptic, yet also a believer which I know sounds weird, but I'm always fascinated listening to spiritual and psychic talk, and have learned a lot about it from my friend. Being an avid Drew podcast listener when I heard him promote Susan's podcast I added this to my daily lineup and love it! I feel Susan has a very soft and spiritual side to her and I am really enjoying all the different guests she has had on and look forward to listening to more, I'm also sharing this with others to listen to as well! Keep them coming!"
247,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Very entertaining,5,"Whether you believe or not, I don't, this is really entertaining."
248,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,"Love line/This Life fan,",5,"i've known of susan for awhile from being such a big fan of Dr.Drew, so when i was looking for this type of podcast i went straight to Calling Out. I really enjoy it, and the quality is great compared to other psychic shows."
249,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Thanks so very much!,5,"I appreciate the good and bad comments. I actually cried a little reading some, and laughed at a couple. The constructive criticism is ok too. Talking to dead spirits and helping the living is my goal. We all live beyond this dimension, proven by physics, and some of us are more aware than others. Be you and tell me you ideas. @firstladyoflove"
250,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Love this!,5,"I absolutely love this podcast! I found it via Dr. Drew on one of the other podcasts he appears on. This has ALWAYS been a topic of interest for me, and these conversations are always super interesting and enlightening. I listen to every new episode! Thanks, Susan!!!!"
251,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,One of my favorites!!!!,5,Turned me to a believer! I called on a psychic from your show and she was amazing!!!!!
252,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Annoyed,1,"I think this topic is quite interesting, however...I was very annoyed at the constant talking over of one another. I listened to three shows, and that was enough. The host constantly cut her guests off, by talking over them, and usually about herself. If they could keep the cross chatter down, it would be a much better show."
253,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,PODCAST REVIEW,4,I just found this podcast because I'm a listener to Dr. Drew's podcasts and I really really love it. I find mediums so interesting. I like the openness that Susan and her guest have. Please continue the podcast. It helps me get through my work days listening. Also....LOVE when you have Bob Forest and Dr. Drew on as well. I like the entire dynamic. Thanks again!!
254,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Ehm..,1,I'm sorry susan but maybe shouldn't be podcasting. I'm sure you are good at other things. This isn't for everyone.
255,Calling Out With Susan Pinsky,Calling out skeptics and believers...,5,Love the pod and Susan. All of the mediums and psychics that come on the show are great. My fave episode was with Rob Schneider and wife!!
256,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Great content!,5,Really enjoyed listening to this podcast. The information was great and also the sound quality
257,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,üòñ,5,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a great podcast but I had to shut it off 3 seconds in because I‚Äôm not looking for insight on Tarret & I will go mad if continue to listen.
258,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Great resource for beginners,5,I am a beginner to tarot and I love the clear explanations and how this podcast is split by the cards. It‚Äôs wonderful the author is giving this information for free!
259,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Great information,5,"Roberta feels very knowledgeable. I have received beneficial information to build my confidence. I‚Äôve had a tarot deck in my life since I was 19. At 33 I know I have the power of intuition. I‚Äôve been taking my God given gift more seriously. It‚Äôs nice to be able to hone my gift. Thank you Roberta for honing your gift and sharing it with the world.
If I had any complaints, this podcast seems like it was recorded at minimal volume. I need to turn it up very loud in my car to even hear it."
260,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Very informative,5,A very well and descriptive podcast.
261,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Worth a Listen,4,I just recently started listening. She seems knowledgeable and also real. She isn‚Äôt sugar coating anything and I think that important.
262,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,OMG-pronouncing Tarot incorrectly,3,She knows her stuff but please please learn how to pronounce Tarot (it‚Äôs Tar-o) not Tar-et. Otherwise good context but hard to listen to with the constant mispronunciation of the main subject.
263,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Amazing!,5,I listened to one of your first podcasts last night and you are an amazing intuitive woman that I wish our paths would have crossed when you lived in California. I‚Äôm ordering your book for a better understanding of tarot readings.
264,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Grounded and Clear,5,"One of my favorite tarot podcasts even with how flooded the field is lately with great insights from all kinds of practitioners. What makes Lee different is how adept she is with readings‚Äîyou can tell she has decades of experience dealing with a huge variety of questions from different kinds of seekers. She helps not only understand the cards themselves, but how they function in relation to the topic of the question at hand and with surrounding cards. She's clear, open, and grounded. And her voice is so soothing, expressive, and confident."
265,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Pronunciation,5,Roberta clearly knows her stuff when it comes to tarot but it‚Äôs pronounced tare-OH. Not: TAR-ot. This might drive me so crazy I won‚Äôt be able to listen.
266,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,mispronunciation,4,"This gives you small digestible bits that help guide listeners on the journey of learning Tarot. But I have to say, everytime she mispronounces the work Tarot (sounds like parrot instead of Thoreau) I feel like shutting the podcast off. Seriously? Its rhymes with Thoreau, not parrot."
267,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,The Language of Tarot,5,"Wow! This is a great podcast. The meanig of each major arcana is explain, but then Roberta gives the different meanings according to the different types of questions, for example, for business, love, etc. She also gives the reverse meaning of each card. I found this podcast very useful to learn the Tarot cards, I have heard all the major arcana, and it is wonderful. Thanks for this great work."
268,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Professionally Done!,5,"I love this podcast! Roberta is to the point, and gives the meaning of the cards according to the position they fall: as in outcome, relationship, business, medical, etc. She doesn't ramble on and on, but gives you just what you need in an understandable presentation. She has a pleasant voice, positive energy, and the podcast is clear and easy to listen to. Keep them coming!"
269,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,The Language of Tarot,5,"As a novice reader of Tarot, I am finding each of Ms. Lee's podcasts invaluable. She includes an incredible amount of information in each podcast, in a thoughtful and easy-to-understand format. I really appreciate her candor (about ""sensitive"" subjects) when discussing a particular card, or group of cards. Candor, I feel, is such an important part of being a good reader, that it cannot be left out of a discussion when learning the Tarot. In my search for reliable information about the cards, I find that Ms. Lee is very knowledgeable of her subject, because her interpretations of the cards make sense to me, and seem to fit in nicely with other reliable sources that I have sought. I especially appreciate the information she gives about a card as it applies to surrounding cards--information that is very difficult to find. Thank you for this wonderful podcast!"
270,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,one of the best thorough reviews of tarot on a podcast,5,i have many tarot books and this was still insightful and very useful to me. Listened to all her podcasts before I bought the book. Her indsights into groupings of cards made reading the tarot spreads easier and i will enjoy reading her full works as much as i enjoyed this sampling! thank you so much Roberta!
271,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Great podcast,5,This podcast is the best one I've found so far. I've listened to a lot over the past few weeks and this is exactly what I was looking for. I'm new to Tarot and needed some guidence and you provided that. I did a lot of research and none of them gave me the same insight as you did. I like how you spend at least seven minutes on each card in the major arcana and elaborated on some similarities of the minor arcana. I want to thank you so much for doing this. I can't believe these are only excerpts from your book. They are so detail. I plan on getting the book when I get pay.
272,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Perfect for any level,5,These podcasts teach from the beginner to the seasoned pro. Gives a whole new way to learn or just brush u on your tarot meanings!
273,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Fantastic resource for anyone interested in Tarot!,4,"I have to say that I am completely in awe of how wonderfully done this podcast is. I have learned more about tarot in the week of listening to these podcast over and over than I have in five plus years of independent study! You have truly opened a whole new level of confidence in me and have tarot something I feel like I can truly do.
You read your reviews and answer to them in the podcast letting everyone know what your response is to specific criticism. Very forthcoming and very admirable. You also ask for suggestions. Therefore, here are mine.
First, do all of the cards in the deck as you have for the major arcana. I know you can't do your entire book, a little on each card, just as you have done so far would be fantastic. Second, I know you have responded to this but I do feel the pronunciation of ""tarot"" is important. First, it detracts from your credibility (not to me because I know your work is awesome), but others not patient enough to give your work a chance because of the mispronunciation. Petty I know, but true. Second, if you are dealing with a total beginner, and they hear one of your level of expertise, they may believe the improper pronunciation is correct, use it, and may come off looking foolish. They don't have your credibility to fall back on.
You have great podcast! I will down load and listen to all of your tarot work repeatedly! They're great! I believe you to be the Waite of our generation. If tarot were computers you'd be Bill Gates. However, Bill Gates would never call his company ""macrosoft"".
Keep up the great work!"
274,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Thanks Roberta.......Question?.....,5,"I have a new deck that I'm learning how to use and need some insight on a few new cards......
Major Arcana card ""oo- The Tree of Life""
And 4 new element cards:
""The holy Stone"" earth
""The Apple Branch"" air
"" The Crane Bag"" fire
""The hazel Wand"" water
I'm using an ""Irish Wiccan Faery"" deck
Thanks again,
Erika"
275,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,A wonderful book and podcast on Tarot!!,5,I have been reading Tarot for over 8 years and I am always looking for new approaches and ideas. Many books and podcasts state the same things over and over again. This podcast lead me to me to the book the Language of Tarot. Being a professional Tarot reader myself I definitely recommend this book and podcast to beginners as well as the advanced readers who want something new.
276,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Wonderful and Well balanced!,5,These podcast are really informative and well thought out. She blends insight and psychology into the card descriptions. Highly recommended!
277,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,The Language of Tarot,5,"Great podcast (s)! I also have her book that she bases her podcasts on and it is one, if not, THE best book out there. I like hearing her voice, it provides a human element and is very inviting. I like to listen and take notes, she is very serious and very detailed, but not at all fuddy duddy or prudish, this is a very mature, informed and serious approach to tarot. Can't recommend this podcast enough!"
278,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Like the bulldog with the kitten in the old cartoon...,4,"It is a generously offered and useful podcast on the Tarot with wince Inducing mis-pronunciations and grammar. Why? It just seems one is being passive aggressive to go on with pronouncing ‚ÄúTarot‚Äù like ‚ÄúPluot‚Äù. I have to say it properly out loud every time i feel the word coming on. Still, the podcast is informative. I might end up getting her book‚Äîha! Maybe that is her strategy‚Äîshe figures we‚Äôll go for the book to be spared the screeching mispronunciation in the lessons!"
279,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Best Tarot Podcast I've Listened To,5,"I've listened to a few Tarot podcasts and this one by far is the most thorough. What I like especially is the fact that she breaks down the interpretation not only by topic (business, love, health), but also by where it falls in your spread (such as an ""advice"" card or ""outcome"" card). In addition, when there could be a notable relationship between the card discussed and another in the deck, she points that out.
In regard to the mispronunciation of ""Tarot""‚Ä¶ it is NOT a mispronunciation. If you actually listen to the podcast from the beginning, she addresses this in the first or second episode. In America, it is more commonly pronounced TARE-oh, but this is only an interpretation, as the origins of the word are unknown. She is also a third or fourth generation Tarot reader who says that there is officially no right or wrong way. (I know people that pronounce it tah-ROH.) The reason she does not address the issue again is because it is totally pointless and a waste of time to have the discussion in her podcast. (I just had to devote a whole paragraph to even say this.)
If you insist she's wrong, then yeah, it may bother you. But if you accept the fact that people pronounce it differently, you'll love it. The podcast is very thorough. The only disappointment I have is that there is not an episode for every card available. I'm not sure if this is because it is so old that some episodes have since been taken down or if it is because she doesn't want to give away her book for free. Either one is understandable. I might just have to buy her book..."
280,The Language of Tarot - A Tarot Podcast,Splendid,5,"I really enjoyed listening to this series of podcasts. The narrator, Roberta Lee, depicts the various cards of the tarot in a very clear and useful way. She draws on very long experience with the tarot and I found her presentation quite engaging especially as it was drawn on her experience with many readings over the years. She also presents the interpretations with humility, not assuming that the interpretations of the cards will be identical for each reader as their experience with tarot reading matures."
281,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Encouraged,5,This podcast is such a blessing.
282,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Yeah,1,Incredibly inaccurate interpretation of scripture. -Chris markham
283,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Pratical lessons,5,I have enjoyed Pastor Chappell's preaching and his spiritual leadership lesson. I will be able to apply these to my ministery.

Each lesson is insightful for the spiritual leader in churches today.
287,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Practical balanced ministry practices,5,Great podcast from a great spiritual leader. This monthly podcast is full of tremendous practical ideas and ministry leadership insights. Thanks for posting
288,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Great resource for a Bible college student just starting in ministry,5,"Pastor Chappell‚Äôs leadership lessons have helped me greatly. It is hard to put a price on the kind of wisdom and experience that can be gleaned from this podcast. In times like these, those of us who are new to the ministry need this. If you are looking for practical help on how to lead in the ministry of an Independent Fundemental Baptist Church, subscribe to this podcast."
289,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,The Old Fashioned Path makes for a Fresh Podcast!,5,"I'm real blessed with Pastor Chappell's heart to grow the spiritual leaders in this generation. In a time where the world of Christianity is falling and diluting itself with the folly of contemporary church movements, Pastor Chappell ministers from a fresh exhortation he gleans from his spiritual heros of the past. He's both old fashion but at the same time super fresh because we're getting old time teachings by a pressing forward man that understands the times! Fundamentally a great man to learn from."
290,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,A Blessing,5,Paul Chappell's teaching and preaching are always a blessing to me. He is a Godly man who desires to be used of the Lord. I look forward to his lessons each week. I hope you will listen to this podcast and know it will be a help to you.

292,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Simple Yet Powerful Principals,5,"I love Pastor Pauls message on Developing a Weekly Schedule, and the stories he shares from his own life. You gotta get this message!!"
293,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Carnal principles for carnal churches,1,"May the Lord deliver us from the methods of men. The presenter should focus on true spiritual development, not corporate (carnal) organizational methods."
294,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,Bible Principles for Spiritual Leaders,5,Pastor Chappell uses the Bible to get at the heart of our core issues in life and ministry. This podcast has helped me so much in the ministry where I serve. If you want to help yourself in the ministry then you need to listen to this podcast. I'm looking forward to the upcoming episodes because I know they will help me.
295,Spiritual Leadership Podcast,"Practical, Powerful, Purposeful",5,I am so grateful for the practical teaching and the powerful preaching that daily helps me to fulfill my purpose as a Pastor.
296,Lucky Mojo Hoodoo Rootwork Hour,Better quality needed,2,"Interesting topics, but quality is super low"
297,Lucky Mojo Hoodoo Rootwork Hour,Love it!,4,"I really love this podcast and have gained a lot of wonderful wisdom over the years from it but I have two suggestions for improvement :
1)Cat- please let your guests speak.You talk over top of them constantly.I can tell you get excited and have a ton to impart. If you just want to talk all the way through -that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt give the impression that we‚Äôre going to get another rootworker‚Äôs viewpoint.
2) it turns into an infomercial for lucky mojo products a lot. I get it- you‚Äôve gotta pay the bills... but maybe focus on ‚Äú grocery store magic‚Äù or less expensive supplies from time to time.Not everyone can afford you and shipping from California."
298,Lucky Mojo Hoodoo Rootwork Hour,Great podcasts,5,Always have great guess and interesting topics

315,Future Primitive Podcasts,"A wide range of positive, solution oriented topics",5,"Thoughtful questions delivered gently and incisively that give the responders a lot to think about. This makes for fascinating conversations on a wide range of important, life-positive topics."
316,Future Primitive Podcasts,Future Primitive Dot Org,5,"Joanna Harcourt-Smith and John Lamb Lash are discussing some of the most important topics of our time - and discussing them well. I was particularly impressed with their dialogue on entheogens, but it appears those talks were simply the hooks reeling me into a treasure-house of resource, information, and common sense. I would say, if you made it here to read what I am writing, you should probably check this out.
I cannot believe that I am the first one to leave a review for this podcast.
It is an honor though.
Thanks you two.

317,Sunday,A needed coverage on religious news,4,"Love listening to the different main religious stories of different faiths. But, the interviewees are often cut short in midsentence and rushed to finish their sentences. Why not cut down a little on the number of stories but allow for more in depth reportage?"
318,Sunday,Yes!,5,I love having a place to go for religion news!
319,Sunday,No.,1,No.
320,Sunday,Wonderful program,5,What a simply wonderful program. I listen to it weekly without err. The guests are respected but held to account and the entire feel is controlled yet open. Good job
321,Sahaja Yoga Meditation | Online Meditation Course,Best online home course,5,"This is as good as it gets towards learning to meditate at home. This technique itself is very powerful and these classes help in attaining that daily dose of peace and recharging. Good for all age groups, regardless of ethnic backgrounds. Great commendable effort. The best things in life are still free."

325,SHE Talks,#KALI,5,"I am a respecter of the Goddess! The irony of today is I randomly chose my Goddess for the Month with my card deck and KALI showed up.
I am a long standing fan of Dr. Northrup, Marianne Williamson and Carolyn Myss. To think the 1st podcast I listened to Dr. Northrup
Acknowledged your Journey as Kali inviting you to come with her. I was floored when she mentioned Kali. But- as a fellow Empath and truster of the divine, I know it was not an accident!üí´
Your podcast is brave, necessary, timely, and in tune with the Re-awakening of the Goddess on this planet. Sending you light and positive vibes on your journey! I will support the movement by standing in the gap as one of your audience members and a Sister in the Movement.üëë"
326,SHE Talks,wonderful,5,"Sara is real and raw and is talking about things that really matter in the world today. I am loving this podcast, thank you Sara!"
327,SHE Talks,"Deep and meaningful teaching, in an easy and accessible format",5,"Sara is a special teacher, we are so lucky to have access to her offerings in this way. She is one of the most deeply authentic and wise teachers I have ever studied with and I eagerly gobble up every new episode of this wonderful podcast! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
328,SHE Talks,Good and getting better,4,"I learned about Sara Avant Stover about a year ago and was looking to drink up and learn everything about The Way of the Happy Woman. The most recent series (in summer, called Poolside Sutras) is a much better quality and much easier to listen too. The content of the entire series of the podcast is wonderful, helpful, nourishing and I can't get enough. I hope she'll do more and inspire other women who talk about feminine spirituality to post more talks because she is right, we need them! But the quality of the first two series was distractingly bad for me. I have a hard time hearing so I need clear and consistant sound. I only mention that so you are aware - especially if you start at the beginning. That's the only negative for me. Thank you Sara and The Way of the Happy Woman for these wonderful podcasts!"
329,SHE Talks,"Beautiful, down-to-earth inspiration",5,"Loving the poolside sutras, such a great way to remind each other of the ways we can reconnect to our inner wisdom through small steps and gentleness. If you're looking for inspiration check out the episode about cultivating a daily practice! Thank you Sara for telling it how it is & holding this space <3"
330,SHE Talks,The Dharma talks I've been searching for.,5,"I really enjoy Dharma talks, but haven't found what I was looking for until Sara's podcast. She brings a needed feminine perspective, balancing typically Yang dominating spiritual views/perspective with Her wise Yin. It's loving, strong, and deeply nourishing."
331,SHE Talks,Each show is a spoonful of nourishment,5,"I experience so much beauty in this podcast - specifically in the weaving together of ideas, embodiment practices, and gentle yet active invitations to connect to self / Self / She / center.
Thank you Sara and The Way of the Happy Woman Team for bringing this into being!
With gratitude
Ashley Aspentree"
332,SHE Talks,Wonderful Wise Soulful Nourishing Advice,5,Sara Avant Stover is a powerhouse of strong love and deep nourishment. Her podcasts touch on timely topics that modern women can benefit and evolve from. Deeply grounding and nurturing to our very core.
333,SHE Talks,Nourishment for Weary Souls,5,"I stumbled upon Sara's SHE Talks in the fall, and it's been one of the most incredible gifts. The interviews, topics, teachings go deep, and these talks have exposed me to much that I hadn't yet encountered in my spiritual journey & healing journey thus far. A feminine way of being, living, doing...in all aspects of life? Without realizing it, this is the precise thing I'd been deprived of (and longed for) for so long. I can hardly express the gratitude I feel for Sara & her work - it's been the sweetest guide, and it's already led me on a trajectory that I didn't know was possible before."
334,SHE Talks,"Wise, Beautiful, and Deeply Feminine",5,"This is one of the few podcasts I listen to regularly, and the ONLY one whose new episodes I wait for so excitedly. Sara Avant Stover‚Äôs deeply feminine approach is unique in the world of spiritual teachers. Her podcast and books (both of which I highly recommend, too) beautifully show how the everyday world of work, parenting, and relationships is not separate from ‚Äúspiritual life‚Äù‚Äîour everyday life IS where spiritual work happens, sometimes gracefully, sometimes messily. Sara‚Äôs work is both inspiring and practical. By providing advice about meditation, journaling, yoga, and much more, she shows exactly what we can do to deepen our spiritual practice in the midst of our busy days. Her approach is Buddhist-based, but so inclusive that it can really be appreciated by anyone, no matter her religious tradition. Sara shares generously of her own spiritual growth, challenges, pains, and joys; she definitely doesn‚Äôt present herself as a teacher on a pedestal, but as a sister, guide, and friend. Her work is life-changing. Plus her speaking voice is lovely‚Äîa pleasure to listen to!"
335,The Way of the Desert - Co-Creator Network,Empowering,5,"Amazing. However where is Mr. Miguel Ruiz as spokesmen? I would appreciate hearing his voice, his class or radio. I love Jr.'s however please allow us to hear your dad's voice. Love Light Peace"
336,The Way of the Desert - Co-Creator Network,The Oral Tradition of My Family.,5,Such a plethora of insightful information here and on so many meaningful topics. I appeciated the episode on oral tradition and carrying on family values and history. I'm looking forward to learning more in future episodes...thank you!
337,The Way of the Desert - Co-Creator Network,Mastery of Love,5,"After I read, the Mastery of Love by Don Miguel Ruiz, I was in absolute love with the author and how simple his thought process is yet filled with profound wisdom and provoking to take step back and simply live, love and laugh. I truly enjoy this podcast, only wished there was less advertising, however, I do understand how important it is.
I listen to the playlist while I do my morning routine and sometime re-listen to my favorites. Thank you for all you do, you and your dad indeed have changed my life and my thought process."
338,The Way of the Desert - Co-Creator Network,Awesome podcast,5,"I love this podcast. After reading The Four Agreements I felt so thirsty for more knowledge. Miguel's podcast are invaluable to me. Easily digestible words of wisdom & insight I can relate to. Thanks & keep up the good work! By the way, when are you going to do a Spanish version of the podcast?"

340,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,The best quality online teachings available,5,"I have been a student of shamanism and indigenous healing traditions for about 10 years now. I have worked with many teachers both in the US and abroad. Over the years I continually come back to Nicolas Breezewood and this extraordinary podcast. I suspected at first, but now I truly know that this treasure trove of knowledge is incredibly rare and very likely the greatest teachings on these topics available outside of a one on one apprenticeship or workshop context. Thank you Nicolas, if there was a Nobel prize for protecting and advancing Shamanism you should win it! - Michael, host, Entreprenuers Awakening podcast"
341,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Highly knowledgeable,5,Nick Breeze Wood presents a thoughtful and conscientious podcast of Shamanism from a perspective grounded in experience and valid research. A rare find.
342,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Shamanister,5,"I love the podcast. It has a real warmth to it that I just can't get enough of. The fiddle in the beginning, the medicine wheel, shamanic journeying. I'm this close to getting a native american drum since I already play the native american flute; it only makes sense, right?"
343,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Mate your the best,5,love it. very very good. Sun Bear recordings are classic
344,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Fantastic,5,"It is definitely informative, friendly, and entertaining.... Great job"
345,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Warm and Friendly,5,"I have really enjoyed listening to Nick Wood on shamanic practice. He is particularly helpful for me on the Medicine Wheel and shamanic journeying. These are very conversational, more like listening to a friend than hearing a lecture, which I appreciate it. I wish he would record some more--the last he recorded of himself was about a year ago."
346,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,Entertaining and Informative,5,I really enjoy listening to Nicholas; he has such a spontaneous and engaging speaking style. The information is valuable to those in a broad range of spiritual traditions interested in growing their spiritual practice.
347,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,excellent podcast!,5,very informative and entertaining. keep up the good work!
348,3Worlds - The Shamanism Podcast,a wonderful podcast,5,Wonderfully informantive and an all out joy to listen to. I look forward to each new episode
349,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Great show,4,"I rather listen to them, then to others podcast out there that tend to sugarcoat everything. Or worse try to sweep all current events under. I been listening to them since March 2017 ."
350,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,No direction- Disappointed,1,I wanted to like this as being a Pagan in the South is particularly isolating. I ended the episode halfway through from boredom. Talked about Pagan Pride with no direction at all. Felt like I was listening to my aunts rambling at a family reunion.
351,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Really Awful,1,"I started with the 2013 episodes posted on iTunes and, to be honest, they were awful, even putting aside the very poor sound quality. Although the episodes have a topic in the title, there does not seem to be any ordered agenda or prepared discussion topics to keep the hosts on track. The result is about 10% of the show on average touches on pagan subjects but most often the discussion thread goes off topic, into personal lives or random events, into the weeds and stays in the weeds. Far too many one word responses (""Ya"", ""Yeah"", ""Hmm-hmph"") followed by pregnant pauses. Little or no engaging, back-and-forth dialogue. I jumped forward to the last episode of 2015 to see if they improved, but, it was unchanged. I do appreciate the time and effort that the hosts put into the podcast, but, it is just painful listening and little content."
352,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Karen Tate - Goddess Interview,2,"I have to say I was more disappointed in this one particular podcast than I have been in any other episode of any other program in the recent past. The description indicated that the episode would be about connecting to the Goddess, and as a newbie Pagan strongly interested in Wicca specifically I was rather excited about the episode. Imagine my disappointment when the entire episode was devoted to feminist political views and barely one sentence regarding Goddess connection was vocalized.
Now, don't get me wrong, I understand the need and right to speak of feminist political views, but don't mask them under podcasts of different descriptions. I felt like there was a bait-and-switch scheme going on, here. I also understand that there are times when a podcast discussion will sway off-topic a little bit, and in my opinion that's okay, too, but it's the responsibility and job of the hosts to pull the discussion back on-topic over a reasonable amount of time, which is NOT 3 hours later.
I'm pretty bummed. There aren't too many Pagan podcast/radio shows out there, and fewer which specifically address Goddess connection, and this one chance or opportunity to hear some strong insight on the topic was derailed by politics and chest-beating. I suppose I'll have to search elsewhere for information and experience.
Peace."
353,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Bad Sound Quality Made Up With Some Content,3,"So I only ever listen when Taylor Ellwood is hosting because of my interest in Pop Culture Paganism and his discussions usually feature those topics. Unfortunately, it can be hard to get through an interview because the sound quality is barely listenable and Taylor can be bad about letting the conversation die. Hopefully he'll get better at guiding conversations in the future.
I would also please ask that the hosts talk to interviewees before hand and stress that they remove extraneous sound. I hate when I can hear someone's chair or floorboards creaking in the background since I usually listen with earbuds while I'm listening. More than once, I've had to cut an episode short because it was so bad."
354,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,"Bad Interviews, Ill-Prepared Hosts, Poor Sound Quality",2,"The hosts never seem prepared to handle interviews and much of the show is full of banal, one-word responses from the female co-host. The guest quality varies widely from decent to outright terrible. The audio quality just makes it all worse."
355,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Painful to listen to,1,"I came across this podcast because I am interested in Norse mythology. After a 3min + Celtic instrumental it finally started. Basically listened to 20 minutes of ""we're Pagan.. yay!"" and ""Awesome"" responses to interview questions I finally had to turn it off. Poor sound quality, lots of dead air between questions and answers, the host carried very little of the load expecting the interviewee to hold the entire conversation. Honestly the only thing I learned was that Thor dressed up in drag once.. boring"
356,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Singularly dreadful,1,"As usual with BlogTalk Radio, poor sound predominates and no one seems to know how to use things like limiters, compressors, or even simple microphone level adjustment.
To complement this, Pagan Musings is uniformly awful. Ill-informed hosts with meandering non-questions babble on and on for literally hours, interspersed with spates of bad music. The hosts seem blissfully unaware of how deeply annoying vocal mannerisms, such as mumbling and smacking the lips, can be in just a few seconds of attempted listening, never mind the two-plus hours most of these podcasts inexplicably demand of the listener.
The podcasts do not offer any particular insight into Paganism. They seem to have been made for the podcasters' friends and family more than anything else, with a high level of unprofessionalism. The idea of having a podcast - particularly one that is offered in a medium like iTunes - is a unique opportunity. Hosts should strive to use the best technology available to them to achieve the best sound possible. They should go ""on the air"" prepared and knowledgeable - about their guests, about their stories, and about their subjects. They should, above all, be interesting and entertaining. None of that happens here."
357,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Great stuff!,5,I love you guys! You bring much needed humor and insight into all subjects (including the tangents) that you discuss.
358,Pagan-Musings Podcast Channel,Lovely,4,Great stuff. I've listen to all the archived shows too.

367,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Down to Earth!,5,"I have been looking for a podcast about psychic abilities for a while and finally found Jennifer. She is so down to earth, not ""preachy"" or reading from a script. Her podcasts are like visiting with a friend sipping coffee or wine. Highly recommend!"
368,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Life Changing Spiritual Growth,5,I just happened to stumble across Jennifer's #SpiritChat last year. The podcasts are full of great guidance and in depth knowledge of the spirit world. I have integrated a lot of the information into my own spiritual life. If you are looking into reshaping or improving your own spiritual walk I really recommend listening! Whether you have great knowledge of the spiritual community or even starting out there are great things to learn and grow for everyone!!!
369,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Spirit Communication,5,These shows are extremely informative. Jennifer has an amazing ability and gift. I think this show is much better than some of the other shows that I have listened to.

371,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Great Show!!,5,Jennifer always has interesting and informative topics and she is very fun to listen to. I never miss a show :)
372,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,"Not bad, needs improvement",3,"The host struggles to follow a thought to completion. She backs up, makes side comments, adds irrelevant information, before moving on with her point.
The quality of the audio is sub par, very echoey and statically. She insists on recording knowing she is going to cough and clear her throat throughout the show.
This is not a how to or a guide to develop your sensitivity."
373,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Sure I'm rating before I even listen!,5,"I love all of your books and read them often. I just started getting into spirituality etc. 6 or so months ago. Your books on universal laws, psychic intuition, soul dna, all helped me more than anything else.

G"
374,#SpiritChat by Jennifer O'Neill,Self absorbed,1,"This woman talks incessantly about herself, non stop. If you are seeking enlightenment, this is NOT the podcast for you. If on the other hand you want to know all about this host, go for it. Boring, boring, boring!"

427,Spiritual Insights w/Charlotte Spicer‚ÄîSpirituality & Metaphysics Talk Radio,Amazing,5,This podcast has wonderful guests and I enjoy calling in for a quick healing by Charlotte. You don‚Äôt want to miss this!!
428,Spiritual Insights w/Charlotte Spicer‚ÄîSpirituality & Metaphysics Talk Radio,Politics here,1,"I was listening, relaxing, centering myself, when she starts on a rant against President Trump. In my opinion he is proAmerican to his core, and is doing everything in his,power to help Americans and this country. His personal life has not been admirable before becoming president. Compare this to the actions of Kennedy and Clinton during their presidencies. Anyway, I was extremely annoyed at having to listen to this when I was relaxing and meditating. Deleted it of course."
429,Spiritual Insights w/Charlotte Spicer‚ÄîSpirituality & Metaphysics Talk Radio,this podcast is awesome,5,this podcast is fantastic and the host is awesome and really holds it down
430,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Enlighten us,5,Love the insights to truth found here!
431,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Listener for life,5,"I searched podcasts that discussed the works of Joseph Campbell, and found one here. It was wonderful! I found the discussion insightful, and inspirational. The section about The Odyssey helped me to see new ways to approach novels that I‚Äôve been teaching for a while. I still dream of attending Pacifica Graduate Institute, and earning a PhD in Mythological Studies. Sigh"
432,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Unintentionally Hilarious,5,"Imagine if Alex Jones was on the far left. It's the perfect mix of feminism and spirituality, so far removed from reality it's funny."
433,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",#1 Time listener,5,Loved the message & the energy!
434,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Complete crap,1,"Full of hatred and lies, as well as pure ignorance. Sheep live here."
435,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",So much hate,1,Wow I've never listened to a podcast that hides under a veil of love but spreads hate.
436,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Too judgemental,1,"The idea of the show and the topics would be great if the host didn't insult the values systems of anyone who might feel differently than she does. Blatant insults. It's one thing to agree to disagree, but she just simply insults anyone with differing views. Unsubscribed and deleted."
437,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Amazing show don't miss it,5,"Karen Tate's Voices of the Sacred Feminine radio show changed my life- literally. I started listening to her, streaming online from my blackberry pearl when I was very sick and bed-bound. She stayed with me throughout my illness and now it's two years later and I subscribe to her podcast via iTunes and never miss! It keeps me on my path and connected to a web of the most amazing, important, powerful women alive today."
438,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Great feminist spirituality resource,5,"Karen always has great guests, interesting and relevant topics, and a well articulated point of view. I come back frequently. Good stuff! Thank you, Karen!"
439,"Sex, Religion, Power and Politics",Excellent resource!,5,"I love Voices of the Sacred Feminine and appreciate the availability of the podcasts so very much. I always learn something new from these podcasts. Interesting guests, fascinating topics, informed and engaging hostess. This show is great for anyone interested in women's studies, feminism, goddess studies, feminist spirituality, liberal politics, and the divine feminine. Truly phenomenal!"
440,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Wow!!,5,I am so surprised and honestly blown away! This is so perfectly honest and refreshing. Thanks so much!
441,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Appreciation!,5,"Have found this podcast to be insightful for about three years now. Really enjoy the dynamic between the two hosts. The topics they dive into are interesting and relevant. I also love the ""fear of the week,"" but especially the recommendations."
442,Homebrewed Culture Cast,"Author, Teacher, Minister",5,"Amy and Christian share the most crucial contemporary issues of church and culture with depth and breadth. They do so authentically--with humor *and* vulnerability. This is one of my favorite podcasts. Thank you, Amy and Christian!"
443,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Cultured!,5,"Great stuff here with Christian, Amy & Slim. Always thoughtful, always engaging. Wonderful to have meaningful faith-centered conversations to listen in on and then, in turn, have in our own community."
444,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Geat!,5,"Great podcast. I look forward to every episode. Live culture casts are great, too!"
445,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Cutting Edge,5,"Front rank, vanguard, tip of the spear, far out forums."
446,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Please Stick to the Original Formula,4,"HB CultureCast is really the only podcast I listen to on a regular basis. It is insightful, funny, and timely. I appreciate the honesty and the differing voices of Amy, Christian, and Jordan, as well as the intern and the page. Guests on the show have also been relevant and thought-provocing. You make it cool and normal to be a Christian. However, it is not interesting to me to hear people drink and discuss bourbon or go through the boring process of home brewing. In the past I would listen to HBCC while home brewing because the process was so boring. Please guys stick to the format you do so well. Spin-off another bourbon appreciators and home brewing podcast if necessary."
447,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Little to do with Christianity,1,"If you like hearing the f-word and other foul language, then I suppose this podcast is for you. If you are a Christian and don't care for that kind of language, there is virtually no other reason to listen.
The Sci-Fi Christian podcast is better for Christian listeners and the Nerdist podcast is much better at swearing and having a good time, so check them out."
448,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Y'all Are Great,5,"Keep up the good work, the podcast is a lot of fun and it offers a great contrast to the other Homebrewed feeds."
449,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Thank You for Making My Work Commute More Enjoyable!,4,"Seriously, though -- it's refreshing to hear thoughtful dialogue around culture and faith, and it helps that you approach things with a healthy dose of humor.
My only advice is this: have more women on the show! You know, Carolyn Weber, Anne Lamott, Susan Wise Bauer, Nadia Bolz-Weber, Sandra McCracken, Lauren Winner, et al. Having two out of fourteen women interviewees is better female representation than the church leadership at most PCA churches, but c'mon, guys... y'all can do better.
Oh, and you should have Josh Garrels on the show. He lives in Portland. Could be some good times."
450,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Yes Please!,5,I love Christian & Jordan's progressive Christian take on culture. It won't take you more than 2 listens to think they are your liberal Jesus loving friends.
451,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Not to brag or anything...,5,"But yeah, this podcast is pretty sweet."
452,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Bad batch,2,"Not nearly as good as the original Homebrewed Christianity and serves to prove that there's a fine line between entertaining and annoying. Their latest interview with Rachel Held Evans was genuinely appalling. It was like listening to two awkward teens corner a pretty girl who made the mistake of mentioning that she liked anime. They must've spent 30 minutes reveling in the freedom to say vagina or penis to RHE onstage, and the point of it all was to show that Christians are mature enough to use those words correctly...listening to this podcast makes me sad."
453,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Wonderful!,5,"I have always been a huge pop culture nerd. This podcast is just fantastic. Both hosts are witty and engaging. Plus, I love that they too are a fan of church sign fails. Thank you, guys! Please keep them coming. :)"
454,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Worth the listen,5,"Christian and Jordan appear to be goofballs, but their playfulness and humility can be deceiving. They are well informed about Christian culture and have a lot to say about the intersection of faith and culture. Their interview on Bieber, Bono and President Obama with Cathleen Falsani is a must listen. She's had the unique honor to explore these cultural icons up close and the conversation is a revelation for sure.
Tripp, Chad and Bo have perfected the theological dimension of the brew, but there was something missing. Thanks to Christian and Jordan, the brew is both savory in doctrine and in praxis.
Good on Tripp and the boys for adding two more creative minds to the brewery!"
455,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Liberal so called Christianity that is shameful,1,Liberal so called Christianity that is shameful and a stumbling block to truth
456,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Compelling listening,5,"I was already a fan of Christian's writing and thanks to this podcast I'm a Jordan fan now too. Intelligent, irreverent, and funny, it's like a Daily Show for theology nerds and a lighter weight counterbalance to Tripp's more cerebral podcast discussions. My only complaint is these episodes are sooo long, hard to carve out almost an hour and a half to listen all at once but if you pause and comeback later you lose the flow of what was being discussed. Wish they were broken into shorter segments, other than that a great production!"
457,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Great Podcast!,5,"I've listened to the Homebrewed Christianity podcasts from the beginning, and the CultureCast is a great new addition. Christian and Jordan provide a entertaining and intriguing view and numerous aspects of American culture. Sometimes light, sometimes heavy, the show always presents compelling interviews and discussion. Plus, the Church Sign Epic Fails and the Names of the Year always prove hilarious."
458,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Most excellent...,5,"If you're looking for a podcast to stretch your understanding of cultural Christianity and how it interacts with the culture at large, then this is your podcast. Plus, it's pretty hilarious. Good stuff."
459,Homebrewed Culture Cast,"Beiber, Obama, Bono...",5,"Worth a listen for sure! I just listened and enjoyed everything but the background music. If you can get past that and the fact Jordan frequently uses bibles to kill spiders, you're good."
460,Homebrewed Culture Cast,Entertained and engaging,4,"I'm here to listen, think and learn. Christian and Jordan offer plenty of interesting topics and engaging interviews that are worth the time. I don't always agree, but I'm grateful for a podcast like this brings to the table timely discussion."
461,Homebrewed Culture Cast,"It's good, but...",4,"Is ""Christian"" his real name?"
462,30 Odd Minutes,Fun show!,5,This is simply the most entertaining show ever made about the paranormal. My whole family enjoys it!
463,30 Odd Minutes,30 odd awesome minutes!,5,I was actually there for this! Jeff is a pretty amazing person!
464,30 Odd Minutes,awesome,5,you all rock. i love this podcast. i cant wait until the next one comes out. keep up the great work.
465,30 Odd Minutes,"Great Stuff Jeff, Keep It Coming!",5,"Just had to comment that I've been watching for a wile now, and your show never let's me down! Thanks for all the great info, and the laughs."
466,30 Odd Minutes,"My Odd Review by Carlston ""Chops"" Wood",5,"The wit, wisdom and weirdness of Jeff Belanger and his crew of Oddballs is the only reason necessary to spend 30 highly entertaining minutes enjoying this podecast!
From alien abductions to bigfoot, to ghosts, legends, hauntings and beyond. Each unique episode features the most knowledgeable guests from that field and no one is spared from a healthy dose of the Oddball hazing and humor!
The Mothership is manned by the finest spaced out crew since starship enterprise first went towards the final frontier. Oddball Sarah Coombes is intelligent and lovely and certainly would give Lt. Uhura a run for her money. As science officer Matt Moniz vulcanizes his role alongside Andy Lake who reports and narrates with no tribble at all! At the helm is the incomparable Captain Jeff Belanger whom if you chose to compare with other captains you would probably come up with a 70/30 blend of Captain James T. Kirk and Jack Sparrow but all Jeff 100%. You have to subscribe to this podcast and watch them all to find how I reached my percentages, but I think you will agree, any way you look at it this top notch podcast it is decidedly strange, addictively entertaining, and above all else very, very odd!"
467,30 Odd Minutes,Crazy!,5,"I love watching 30 odd minutes! These guys are crazy, fun, and educational! What more could you ask for?!?!"
468,30 Odd Minutes,Queen,5,"The best show...informative, funny, and extremely addictive. A must to download."
469,30 Odd Minutes,Amazingly odd!,5,"Once I got a computer that had working sound, I was finally able to watch 30 Odd Minutes...and let me say, I'm hooked. I love watching it! Jeff Belanger is really great with those he interviews and always adds that odd factor in there at times. I also love how personal the show can get by telling on air who says what in the chatroom, by Twitter or by email. The 30 Odd Crew is great to watch! If you're into the paranormal - this IS the show for you! Even if you're not into the paranormal, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed!! :)"
470,30 Odd Minutes,LOVE Those Oddballs!!!,5,"You don't usually hear the words ""educational"" and ""wacky"" in the same sentence, but that's just what 30 ODD MINUTES is!
The show exposes me to fascinating theories and ideas, but ithe tone of the show is ridiculously light-hearted and fun! They take the subjects they cover seriously, but none of them (not even the guests) seem to take themselves overly seriously.
Smart people discussing thought-provoking subjects and having a blast, and inviting me along for the ride? SIGN ME UP! :D It's one of the high points of my week!"
471,30 Odd Minutes,Great Show!,5,"Have always loved Spooky Southcoast, now I'm hooked on 30 Odd Minutes. Great topics presented in a very entertaining way. Keep the shows coming! Hatch61"
472,30 Odd Minutes,Love this Show!,5,"Jeff Belanger has hit one out of the park with ""30 Odd Minutes"". Yeah, it's a bit choppy but the show is fast-paced and witty. And what the heck, you just might learn something new while you chuckle. I look forward to many more episodes and will be sure to tell my friends about it. Good job, Jeff and crew!"
473,30 Odd Minutes,"Perfect, as always",5,"Don't let Jeff Bellanger's easy-going and somewhat comic style fool you. This man is a deeply intelligent and talented researcher, author, and lecturer - and now star of his own show. 30 Odd Minutes is a wonderful program that packs a lot of information into it, and I recommend it very strongly to any fan of the paranormal."
474,30 Odd Minutes,Stay Odd,5,"Jeff Belanger has a style and delivery that makes other paranormal shows pale in comparison. This is the freshest, most fun thing to come out of the paranormal field in a long time! My only wish is that they would go to a weekly show. Long live 30 Odd Minutes! Stay Odd!"
475,30 Odd Minutes,Awesome shows,5,Hey these guys rock! For the budget that they're working with...it's a great show! Very entertaining and informative...wish it was longer though!
476,30 Odd Minutes,Perfect podcast!,5,This podcast has a perfect balance of humor and the paranormal. Great guests add to the overall greatness of this podcast!
477,30 Odd Minutes,Love it!,5,I've chatted live during the Tuesday podcast and these guys are great. Belanger is well known throughout the paranormal community and does a great job of balancing common sense with a quest for the true paranormal experience. Jeff has a professional delivery and his team back him up well. I'm hooked.
478,30 Odd Minutes,Great show,5,"I look forward to every new show, I wish there were more new episodes. The shows are interesting and funny. Great show!!!"
479,30 Odd Minutes,Sorry,1,"You are trying too hard to be funny. It detracts from the subjects discussed. I like humor. But found the 'humor' forced and not funny. It is very unprofessional.
Sorry.
I probably will delete the shows I've downloaded."
480,30 Odd Minutes,"Short, informative, and odd",4,"Love the format, topics, and the fact that it's a new England based show that not only focuses on New England but the whole country as well. My only concern is the consistency of shows. Will these come out weekly or monthly?"
481,30 Odd Minutes,Love you guys,5,You and Spooky SoutCoast are my all time fave podcasts.
482,30 Odd Minutes,Look Into The Abyss,5,"Jeff Belanger and his group of ""Oddballs"" take you on a 30 minute journey into all that is paranormal in this fascinating webshow. The edifying and in-depth analysis provided in each half hour gives the fans a refreshing grasp on another dimension of reality. Don't let the non-fictional atmosphere fool you, however. Jeff certainly knows how to add the lighter notes to the documentation making this not only a gratifying half hour, but a fun one as well! Definitely worth the watch! The truth IS out there, and 30 Odd Minutes will find it!"
483,30 Odd Minutes,Awesome !!!,5,"30 odd minutes will be the best 30 minutes of your day. It is informative, funny, and you will wish it would never end. It's amazing how much you can learn in 30 minutes. Become an oddball fan you won't regret it !"
484,30 Odd Minutes,Best 30 minutes of the Week,5,"Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, you get a full 30 minutes of fun each week from Jeff & the Mothership Crew!"
485,30 Odd Minutes,30 Odd Minutes you can't afford to miss,5,"Jeff Belanger and the rest of the 30 Odd crew bring real life experiences with all things weird and unexplained right out in the open for all to see. They don't try to make us believe, they simply put us on the right track to find out for ourselves.
Great show, I never miss an episode."
486,30 Odd Minutes,Always a great show,5,What can I say other than Jeff puts on one heck of a show. Love it.
487,30 Odd Minutes,Always entertaining!,5,"Jeff and his crew always keep the show interesting and lively. The subjects are on topic and informative. Jeff is not only funny and and a great host but he is also relatable, he feels like an old friend and has much respect for his guests.
30 Odd Minutes is the only paranormal TV/web talk show and is done just right. I look forward to every episode."
488,Touching the Stillness,Love on your journey,5,"Paulette, Thank you for all that you are, all that you have been and all that you will ever be!! You are a bright light. I am grateful to you for having helped me to heal. Blessings on your journey. Love, Sandra"
489,Touching the Stillness,Rev Paulette,5,I love your show. It is an inspiration that we need. You introduce us to so many wonderful ideas and people.
490,Touching the Stillness,touching the stillness,5,Paulette quiets the mind and awakens the soul!
491,Touching the Stillness,Great way to start the day,5,Amazing podcast
492,Touching the Stillness,A Tuesday Treasure,5,I so look forward to Tuesday so I can listen to Rev Paulette. She gives me a new and positive focus each week. Love It !!!!!! Wish I could give this program 10 stars !!!
493,Touching the Stillness,Gentle and Empowering,5,I recently discovered Paulette's radio show and CDs. She has a gentle power which empowers and holds space for the listener to connect to his/her own Presence. Her teachings are sure to inspire regardless of your chosen spiritual or religious practice or not. Thank you Paulette for sharing your gifts with the world. What a blessing!
494,Touching the Stillness,New Listener loving the program,5,I am a new listener and also new to a 12 step recovery program. Paulettes messages are so uplifting and supportive. They definately help me keep my head in the right place throughout the day and remember to breathe and take care of myself. Thank you so much Paulette!
495,Touching the Stillness,Paulette Starts my Day,5,"I frequently download Paulette's podcasts and listen to them in the morning as I prepare for my day. Her lovely,soothing voice guides me to center myself. The format of her program is intro, prayer, music, program, meditation and ending. I can listen to the entire program or maybe just one piece if I'm rushed.
Paulette, I can tell that you put a lot of thought, love and prayer into preparing these programs. Bless you!"
496,Touching the Stillness,Stay in practice,5,Rev. Paulette gives you a time every week to slow down and be in the moment.
497,Touching the Stillness,Paulette is awesome!,5,I love Paulette and her message. She uplifts me everytime I replay her message. Great for getting me on the right track in the morning. Her voice is soothing and I love the international connection. Just what I needed.
498,Tapestry from CBC Radio,Consistently Great,5,I happened upon this show on my car radio while driving through Ontario on my way to New York from Iowa. It was an interview with a Rolling Stone reporter who had visited Medjugorje to report on the alleged apparitions of Mary. I‚Äôve been hooked ever since and listen in the States via podcast. Host Mary Hynes is entertaining and affable and brings out the best in her guests.
499,Tapestry from CBC Radio,Great for the soul,5,A spirit and soul inspiring podcast. Mary is a delightful host and covers such interesting topics. I look forward to the fall season.
500,Tapestry from CBC Radio,great program. love it,5,"I really enjoyed listening to Reza Aslan and Lesley Hazleton episodes. Although I find the program little too polite for my liking (it must be how Canadians are), I find the program very informative and interesting."
501,Tapestry from CBC Radio,wonderful program,5,I wait for this program every sunday...get to listen to it when I spend summers in BC...miss it when I go back to California...no satellite radio at home...wish more of the older programs could be made available as podcasts...I find it always to be a very stimulating and thought provoking program led by a fine and informed interviewer...
502,Tapestry from CBC Radio,i love this podcast,5,this is not only my favorite cbc podcast but also my favorite podcast of all time
503,Tapestry from CBC Radio,enh.,2,"The same basic concept as Speaking of Faith from American Public Media, but with a much more irritating host. I like a lot of CBC Radio programs, but this ain't one of them."
504,AstroTwins Radio,Great Show!,5,I am surprised this does not have more reviews. Very well researched and I enjoy listening too the two of them talk. Always provides great information that is relevant and seems too be well researched. I look forward to these.
505,AstroTwins Radio,Helpless turned hopeful,5,I didn't know how much I appreciated this podcast until the election. Thank you for putting the stars in perspective in relation to history and current events.
506,AstroTwins Radio,Great,5,I really really enjoy & appreciate this insight. Thank you üôèüèæ
507,AstroTwins Radio,So excited to find you here!,5,I've been listening to your daily readings on Audible and I'm super excited to find your show! Thanks!
508,AstroTwins Radio,AstroTwins Radio,5,"Thrilled the podcast exists!! Thank you, thank you, thank you Tali & Ophi! Looking forward to more."
509,Center for Spiritual Living,Indecision lesson,5,Thank you Dr. Chris for your powerful lesson on Indecision. It is so apropos for all of us during this time of change and reflection.
510,Center for Spiritual Living,"Dr Chris, what a speaker!",5,"I have been listening to Dr Chris Michaels all year from my home in LA and he has inspired and motivated like few others. Fantastic, pertinent for our times, full of humor and heart-breaking/heart-opening stories"
511,Center for Spiritual Living,Blessings and Gratitude,5,"Blessings and Gratitude for sharing your gifts of clarity, truth and purpose.
You and your guest speakers inspire me to be the best version of me that I am! And to share this gift with others. And so it is!"
512,Center for Spiritual Living,She is a Gem,5,I cannot say enough about Dr. Arleen she has a fantastic wit and a great teacher.
513,Center for Spiritual Living,Excellent Podcast!!,5,"She is an excellent speaker, so glad I found this Podcast! The messages are wonderful in these teachings. Thank you for these Podcasts!"
514,Center for Spiritual Living,The best of the BEST,5,"Dr. Arleen Rose Bump is without any doubt, one of the finest teachers of ""Science of Mind"" methodology. I have the pleasure to listening live, each week, as her church is across the street from where I live, but I also carry the podcasts with me and listen to them often, as she challenges me to open my mind and heart, to realize my potential. Outstanding teacher, outstanding teachings, download and enjoy."
515,Starseed Radio Academy,Finally a home base,5,"As a starseed, it is great to have somewhere to find resources. Every episode, I receive an upgrade of some sort. I‚Äôm happy to know there are others in the same journey and especially during the time of the Coronavirus, feeling connected and having a team."
516,Starseed Radio Academy,One way communication:,2,"A good effort but a one- way street in terms of their being willing to listen or receive feedback ,or any feedback communication on the podcasts or anything ( other than guests willing to take callers )for that matter.
Disappointing that in this era of live feed or comments at YouTube the podcast or broadcast hasn‚Äôt t kept up with this aspect.
Feels to me like a female version of ‚Äú the good old boys network ‚Äú- infomercials with the same mainly females promoting their services and ‚Äú special ‚Äú products to ‚Äú starseeds ‚Äú. Not so balanced, and unwittingly elitist apparently; ( only certain folks qualify to show in person to the exclusive semi annual gatherings... ‚Äúexclusive starseeds ?!‚Äù)
Valiant effort, but a bit out of touch .
Needs new blood , innovation ,and a bit less of the ‚Äúguru experience‚Äù , more fitting equality for the new age of Aquarius .
Lots of heart , untouchable gurus, dated ... eh , some room for improvement & freshness requested , Ladies .
Appreciation for the foundation , yet rather bored now ..."
517,Starseed Radio Academy,Been listening for years,5,"This podcast is to me what Art Bell was to my parents as a kid. Everything. Arielle, Lavendar, Tammy, Anastasia, and anyone I missed; THANK YOU for being here in my awareness. I just can‚Äôt express how much I‚Äôve received from only this podcast. I‚Äôll be here forever and I‚Äôll continue to spread the love. ü¶Ñ"
518,Starseed Radio Academy,Trump is a white hat,3,"Trump is actually a change agent for the new age. The very first Bill he signed and many following that one is to pave the way to bring down the human trafficking networks. His presence on Twitter has fragmented our trust in the mainstream media, the agents of our cabal conditioning. He is an astute student of Sun Tzu who advocates for the irritation of the enemy who has choleric temperament in order to distract them. He‚Äôs playing a game but it‚Äôs 5D chess. Yes the Bushes, Clinton‚Äôs & Obama‚Äôs have done some very bad things with a long plan to bring us down. Many public people we know by name are involved including in the media (of course they don‚Äôt like him ;). Trump is finishing what JFK meant to do but was stopped & his son will see his father‚Äôs murder avenged thanks to the incredible man in office who is willing to put on a front to get the big job done (while 100s of his appointments are kept from their posts). Tribunals are ahead. His uncle, John Trump, had inside knowledge of Tesla‚Äôs work. Dark to Light. Hang in there. I ‚ù§Ô∏è the Pleiadians!"
519,Starseed Radio Academy,Love ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,Love & More Love ‚ù§Ô∏èEspecially the off the beaten track starseed News.
520,Starseed Radio Academy,An every week must!,5,"I look forward to this podcast every week, especially for the news segment of the show! Really interesting topics covered."
521,Starseed Radio Academy,Great group of hosts,5,Fascinating shows with wonderful hosts. They ask insightful questions and provide a great outlet for discussing spiritual topics.
522,Starseed Radio Academy,You'll know whether this is show is for you,5,"If you aren't supposed to listen you won't be called to try it out. If you are, you won't be able to resist trying out new shows despite maybe not loving the first few you listen to."
523,Starseed Radio Academy,A Great Show!,5,"This very thoughtful and entertaining show includes a news segment and an interview. I have listened to every single episode, and learned much. Do yourself a good favor - Make time for this podcast. Lavandar, Anastasia and Arielle work exceedingly well together to selflessly bring us interesting material week after week. How generous! Thank you."
524,Starseed Radio Academy,Awesome!!!,5,Thank you for this gift!
525,Starseed Radio Academy,bless,5,so much amazing info an mojo on this show
526,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,All time favorite podcast,5,"Rabbi Rami is the best, and all the guests are diverse and informative. I‚Äôm always left feeling inspired. Just wish the episodes were longer but the short and sweet is easy to consume. Highly recommend!"
527,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,Essential Listening,5,"Rabbi Rami effortlessly hosts authentic conversations with a rich variety of teachers, activists, artists and other thinkers and doers. Some of my favorite episodes don‚Äôt feature spirituality gurus but people that understand life, the universe and the soul through a unique lens like music, nature, war or science. Every episode expands my mind and heart, even when I think it won‚Äôt."
528,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,Patrick Shen interview missing,1,"I was searching for the interview of Patrick Shen discussing the making of Silence, his documentary, but the episode with that title is missing."
529,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,"Good smart interviews, but way too short",4,"Everyone knows the old joke about the food at summer camp: the food was terrible and the portions were so small.
This is a new spin on that idea. The interviews are always good, sometimes brilliant, but they are held to rigid 20-minute limit which means that sometimes they end just as Rami and the guest are beginning to focus on an issue or to develop a connection among various ideas that were mentioned in the discussion.
Rami is both learned in spiritual lore (he seems to be easily familiar with a wide range of approached) and very down-to-earth (his discussions are usually about everyday implications of spiritual insights and are couched in everyday language). His guests are interesting, smart, articulate people, including the likes of Matthew Fox, Thomas Moore, Damien Echols, and Matthieu Ricard.
I only wish he had more time to spend with them. In a world in which long-form podcast episodes can easily take more than an hour, 20 minutes of this level of discussion can seem like a cruel tease."
530,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,GREAT JOB!,5,WOW‚Ä¶.Essential Conversations Podcast is flat out awesome. Good production quality. Easy to listen. Very impressed Rabbi. Keep bringing it.
531,Essential Conversations with Rabbi Rami from Spirituality & Health Magazine,Wish it was longer,5,"I‚Äôve enjoyed all the guests so far. Very open-minded conversations, and interesting even if I don‚Äôt agree with all the guests‚Äô beliefs. I could have listened to Damien Echols talk for twice as long. It was interesting to hear how he brought so many different beliefs under one roof."
532,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Fabulous podcast and host!,5,I love what Roberts is doing and the information she is sharing. She has a wonderful show and so happy to have discovered it. Five stars for sure!! I love the exploration of death and the afterlife with a positive and informative approach!
533,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Pretty good,5,Great content and great guest! I listen to it at night. Something comforting to listen to before I fall into a blissful slumber ü¶ã
534,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,I enjoy this pod cast very much,4,"Roberta is a wonderful caring person... she seems to have a deep desire to get the information out to us!
She is very insightful she shares her thoughts and I enjoy her interesting input."
535,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Sunny,4,"The guests are top notch and I can tell they have great respect for the host. She in turn is very intelligent , pragmatic, well informed and enthusiastic which I appreciate. However, I wish she could dial down her response as she can sometimes overwhelm the interview especially if she has a personal need for clarification. The host also appears to have some insight into the fact that at times she comes across as very judgmental, but immediately excuses and justifies this in one way or another. It‚Äôs disruptive to the experience."
536,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Profound,5,Profound. Very much Appreciate the hosts insights. She is a wonderful Spirit.
537,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Avid listener,5,"I like the way Roberta asks questions & directs the conversation forward & doesn‚Äôt just allow the guest to ramble on. Probably because of my journalism training, I like focused discussions & some people will keep talking into the weeds if not managed.
I LOVE the wide variety of guests.
I believe podcast hosts should get to do personal digressions if they want to, and often that makes me feel like I‚Äôm informally hanging out in a living room with her & her guests, but I understand why people have negatively commented on her bringing up her own takes on things when they want more time with the guest & it‚Äôs taking up precious air time.
I attended the AREI Symposium this year for the 1st time because of Roberta & I had a fabulous time!"
538,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,N. Riley,3,"Read review about the interviewer talking more than the guest. Decided to listen anyway and found it highly distracting to listen to. The guest did not get much of a chance to share what he came on the show to share. Even if the interviewer is highly versed on the subject we are here to listen to the guest who has been headlined to discuss a certain topic.
I will listen to one more interview. If the guest does not get a chance to just talk without lots of interruptions I will not tune in again. It just makes it super hard/annoying to listen/focus.
Otherwise subject matter was interesting."
539,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Had high hopes,1,"I had hoped to hear a critical discussion of aspects of the afterlife but the episode with Gary Schwartz sounded like a pitch for her version of Christianity. She may not want to claim her version is under the same umbrella but it is. There was not even a reference to other spiritual thoughts but only the conclusion, based on the bible, that Jesus is some ascendant master and that he is The Way."
540,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,EGO!,1,"Wonderful guests. I wish she would let them speak! There are just too many Let-Me-Tell-You-About-Me-and-MY-experience interruptions. Maybe RG could produce the show and hire a compassionate, curious and grounded interviewer."
541,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Seek Reality,5,"I'm so grateful for your marvelous, inspiring podcasts."
542,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Amazing show!!,5,"I really like the ideas behind this cast, as well is the content. It's wonderful to listen to!"
543,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Well-Done and Intriguing,5,"I've been listening to this podcast for the last couple months and I'm consistently fascinated by the content. Roberta clearly has a great command of the subject and is wonderfully passionate about spreading the good news that so many are just hearing about. This is one of the few podcasts I make it a priority to listen to. Anyone hoping for an inspiring and intriguing discussion about what we have to look forward to ""beyond the veil"" need look no further!"
544,Seek Reality ‚Äì Roberta Grimes,Absolutely love this podcast!!,5,I have read Roberta Grimes' books 'The Fun of Dying' and most recently 'Liberating Jesus' and both left me wanting more info! Happy to have this show to listen to for my continuing spiritual growth and realizing that I am so much more than my body. I like making this part of my week. Keeps me on track that there is a much bigger picture to my life and life after death is very real.
545,Quest Monthly Magazine,Need to provide some information for each episode.,3,"I wanted to download some individual episodes, but there's no information on episodes. How do I know which one I want to listen to? I'm not interested in subscribing. Please provide information as to what each program is about, aside from just who's giving sermons for each program."
546,Energetic Synthesis Podcast,Loved the Fascia episode!,5,"My energy healer recommended this podcast to me and I LOVED the fascia episode...a must listen for Estheticians like me, or any kind of body workers.
These are definitely not podcasts you can listen to while multi tasking, but are almost meditation like!"

548,Energetic Synthesis Podcast,Truth Vibration,5,"I have so much Love and respect for Lisa and the Guardians, working tirelessly over the years to spread this vibration of Truth. Thank you to everyone who helps to put this amazing resource forth. As to any who question the monotone nature of Lisa‚Äôs voice in the podcast‚ÄîI would advocate that she is embodying neutral dissemination of information; maybe to an extent that seems odd at first, but it‚Äôs definitely something I‚Äôve grown to appreciate! Again, thank you thank you thank you‚ÄîGSF <3<3<3"
549,Energetic Synthesis Podcast,Robot?,2,"Seems like good content but her voice is very robotic and hard to listen to. Maybe it's a channeled podcast? Not being sarcastic, actually wondering."

553,Energetic Synthesis Podcast,Thank you,5,"Thank you Lisa for all your work! This information has helped me a lot to understand this world, and how the universe works."
554,Energetic Synthesis Podcast,Yipppiiiieeee!!!,5,"OMG! I am ecstatic to have found this! I have been a client of Lisa Renee for many years now, and had the pleasure of working with her one on one, and have been blown away (seriously blown away) by: A. The depth of what she can perceive, and B. The amount of healing that has occurred.
Have been following the newsletter, and subsequent teleconferences and group meditations all along, and much has come from that as well.
Lately my life (yay!) has become so full and busy that i have not been following the newsletter part as closely, but this Podcast!!!!

585,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Thank you,5,Thank you!
586,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Wonderful,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed her podcasts so far. Everything makes sense to me now and I finally feel at ease in life.
587,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Brilliant & Insightful,5,"Teri is a master at sharing the esoteric and unusual in a very relatable, understandable and beautiful way. What she says makes so much sense and I am delighted every time."
588,The Akashic Reading Podcast,"Grounded, insightful, inspiring",5,"Thank you for all the work you do and the wisdom you share, Teri. I‚Äôve been listening to the podcast for a couple years now and have grown in my comfort and abilities in the Akashics, as well as in my own spiritual/inner world. I love the wide range of topics covered, the grounded and inspiring nature of the podcast, and how every episode feels a little like coming home to myself. It has also helped me have more compassion for my loved ones and fellow humans, knowing we are all doing the best we can with the plans we made in a big world full of free will. So grateful!!"
589,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Thank you,5,Thank you
590,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Long time fan,5,So glad I found this podcast again. I‚Äôve been listening for years and Terri is always on point! Love this!
591,The Akashic Reading Podcast,"Thank you, Teri!",5,"I've shared this podcast with so many people since discovering it this year! Her voice is super soothing and contrary to the lower review I believe it to be necessary with the information she is disclosing; you wouldn't want it to be very hyped or emphatic or stern... at least my two cents. Teri is like the sister/aunt/cousin that I would have loved to have growing up; super quirky and into the same somewhat nerdy things as me-and I mean this in the most endearing way possible. This podcast has made me have some ""Ohhh..."" and ""Aha!!"" moments, as well as
a few cries, for sure. Finding this podcast and starting tai-chi three years ago have been the highlights of the past few years of my life, honestly.
I've purchased the intro course and also checked out her Youtube channel, which I recommend everyone to do so as well.
Thank you, Teri, for your councel, guidance, encouragement and wisdom."
592,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Great concise information,5,I love Teri's voice and in-depth content for this podcast. She has a way of packing a lot of really interesting information into a short amount of time. One of my very favorites!!!
593,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Brilliant,5,"Teri explains esoteric concepts touching our day-to-day lives and minds in a clear, no-nonsense and useful way. Thank you!"
594,The Akashic Reading Podcast,"Interesting, am a little confused",3,"I do enjoy this topic and this podcast provides a lot of interesting food for thought. My reluctance to rate it higher is due to a few things: 1. Teri makes a lot of claims about the Akashic records, some in great detail. But, we never hear what she bases this information on. I understand she has extensive experience working with the records but it would be nice to hear her back up some of these claims. I don‚Äôt have a problem with this information being pretty out there and I don‚Äôt dispute the basis for much of it, but she is regularly stating these things as fact without establishing a foundation. 2. This content IS OUT THERE, compared to mainstream thought. Again, I have no problem with that. She talks about these things as if they were as commonplace as anything else though - she speaks casually about them and takes for granted that if what she were saying was even 10% accurate that current science, culture, and everything else would be turned on its head. What she‚Äôs saying is, if true, beyond extraordinary and revolutionary. Yet she speaks about it as if it‚Äôs as ordinary as something you‚Äôd see on page 5 of your daily paper. I‚Äôd like this podcast a lot more if the tone she was speaking in was actually proportionate to the implied significance of the content."
595,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Amazing podcast,5,"I love all the information provided by Terry.
I‚Äôm Akashic Records reader myself and I love learning more and different perspectives and hearing from people who know and Terry is a wealth of inspiring and deep info.
I also love the fact that her episodes are short and full of meaning, no fluff, no unnecessary detail, just what we need."
596,The Akashic Reading Podcast,"Come for the woo-woo, stay for the wisdom",5,"Terri is knowledgeable and entertaining. And while the Akashi stuff is useful, her general wisdom about life is cutting edge. If you never explore the Akashic, this podcast has value in just the worldly wisdom alone. She also speaks with a gentle authority and no-nonsense style that gives me confidence that she is the real deal. There is no overt sales pitch for other products but I am very intrigued by her work. Many questions are answered in these short podcasts. Questions I didn‚Äôt know I had. I am drinking these in. Enjoy!"
597,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Invaluable,5,"Terri is a really great lady. Her knowledge of this terrain is vast, as is her willingness to share it-thank you Terri-I‚Äôm so grateful.
As I navigate your courses, I listen to these podcasts which do a great job of filling in the blanks. I feel that I am learning so much from these podcasts."
598,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Excellent Podcast,5,"I wake up on Wednesday‚Äôs anticipating the new podcast! Teri‚Äôs presentations are organized, well thought out. She has a good voice and good delivery."
599,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Always a new look,5,"Today's lesson on releasing was just what I needed to hear today. So many messages are in the media about releasing, but few tell you the need to move forward once you release something. So right. Don't keep replaying the same issue..just let it go and movce on to what brings you joy."
600,The Akashic Reading Podcast,The real deal,5,I listen to all of these episodes over and over. Teri has a very soothing and reassuring way of talking about the Akashics. She‚Äôs the best.
601,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Awesome!,5,"Teri has phenomenal information to impart and she does it in such a compelling but easy to digest way. I would also recommend signing up for her blog on her website. I have also had a number of readings with her. Her teaching style is patient and encouraging. Also, check her classes through her website or thru the DailyOM. Again, the information is relevant and the accompanying meditations very soothing."
602,The Akashic Reading Podcast,"Love, love, love this podcast",5,I found this podcast after leaving my first akashic reading wondering what in the world ‚Äúakashic‚Äù was. I love the simple breakdown of this complex energetic network. Teri is amazing! If you‚Äôre interested in Akashic readings - start here.
603,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Clear and Concise Truths,5,"Teri is able to communicate very complex subjects in a clear, concise, and ""down to earth"" manner. Everything Teri says resonates as TRUTH to me. Because of Teri's podcasts, I have gained a greater knowledge about Source / Spirit / The Universe, Soulmates, the Akashics, Spirit and Anima Guides, and the pupose of incarnating. As a ""seeker"" I use Teri's podcasts as one of my main sources of information and inpiration. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone trying to understand about the true nature of our existence."
604,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Incredibly Fulfilling,5,I look forward to this podcast each week. I find her to be extremely knowledgeable in so many diverse areas. She is full of wonderful advice. I always come away learning something new and sometimes something unexpected.The podcasts are short and leave me wanting more. I cannot reccomend this podcast highly enough.
605,The Akashic Reading Podcast,So Informative,5,"I loved the Akashic Reading Podcast the moment I first listened. The content is so rich and full of knowledge. A terrific repository of information for those on a spiritual path, and for those wishing to expand their practice."
606,The Akashic Reading Podcast,A wealth of knowledge in a spiritual podcast,4,"This podcast is unlike any other spiritual podcast, Teri imparts so much valuable information with each episode, and I walk away each time with a wealth of knowledge! She is gentle, warm, and teaches in a way I can easily understand and apply what I‚Äôve learned. Since finding this podcast a month ago I‚Äôve gone back to the beginning episodes, working my way through and learning about the Akashics, and I just signed up for her class to learn how to read my own soul book. This is my favorite podcast, I can‚Äôt thank you enough Teri!!"
607,The Akashic Reading Podcast,A must listen for everyone!,5,The insight and clarity her podcasts bring to your perspective on life is truly amazing. Teri helps one in their journey to understand their world and the people in it. I feel like it should be mandatory listening for young adults!
608,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Clear and intelligent,5,"I love the way Teri explains things‚Äîgreat analogies, no dumbing down, everything sounds reasonable and sensible. I‚Äôm learning a lot."
609,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Great Listen,5,I‚Äôm learning so much!!! Thank You!!!
610,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Concise but packs a punch of new spiritual you can trust,5,"I usually prefer longer podcasts, but this is not true if many people. This show is very useful and I feel like I can recommend it to people more practical and to-the-point thst I am.
Teri doesn‚Äôt share much about herself but she seems culturally well rounded and politically self aware while still focusing all the material on self development."
611,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Informative,5,This is a short (no more than 20 minutes) show about the Akasha and I enjoy it immensely. Teri Uktena is a wonderful host. She has a calm charisma and humor. She breaks things down in a way which people unfamiliar will understand the content.
612,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Transformative,5,"I am so pleased to have discovered Teri last December shortly after beginning my journey into the Akashics. I could not have found a better teacher and mentor. Her podcasts, classes, and website have been such an opportunity for expansion and a deepening connection to my soul journey."
613,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Fabulous Information,5,Thank you so much for this podcast. Learn & grow.
614,The Akashic Reading Podcast,Fantastic wisdom,5,"Terry Uktena shares wisdom that is both spiritual and practical for anyone. Being ‚Äúnondenominational‚Äù, she addresses truth and wisdom as the most essential aspects of being human. I have listened to her podcasts for many moons, and as an open minded, spiritually oriented person, have been nurtured, encouraged and challenged by her words and perspective."
615,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Good Vibrations,5,"If I need to feel better, I turn on Marie. Regardless of what the topic is , I get high from the fumes, yet in this case the high has no downside. Marie is a gift."
616,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,"I love her energy, advice, and humor! One of my absolute favorite podcasts!",5,"I'm a HUGE fan of Marie's podcast...she is like an X-ray for energy. It's fascinating to hear how she tunes into people and gives feedback/advice. I have called into the show a few times, and she just delivers the right dose of what I need. I love her vibrant energy and her solid advice. The show is very upbeat...I enjoy listening to it, since it puts me in an even better mood. (Normally I'm in a good mood, but I feel even better afterward.)"
617,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Love to listen each week!,5,I‚Äôve been listening to Maria for years and really enjoy listening to this podcast each week. Thanks Marie for the great content!
618,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Disappointed with Negativity,1,"I really wanted to like this show. I‚Äôve listened to 4 or 5 episodes and they were fine. I thought Marie was new to podcasting and she‚Äôd get better with time so I kept listening. Today I listened to the October 11, 2018 episode. Frankly, I was shocked by the negative, self righteous, hate filled talk between Marie and her guest. Essentially, Marie is negating the view point of anyone outside of her far left thoughts. I understand that most people who consider themselves ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù tend to side with the left, but she goes too far IMO. Most podcasters try to be more sensitive around these issues unless that‚Äôs what your show is about.
She states she was feeling ‚Äúnegative energy for no good reason‚Äù (hmmm, LOA) and the need to ‚Äústop yourself and choose to have a different experience‚Äù. Good advice. She needs to heed it and choose to give her audience a better experience. I tuned into her show hoping for uplifting information and advice not negativity In a nation of political upheaval we don‚Äôt need this added hatred and narrow mindedness when we are seeking the opposite."
619,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Review,5,"Marie is exceptional- inspiring- intelligent and genuine
I look forward to her podcasts
However- I have been disappointed that she was constantly discussing her political views . I do not listen to her for her opinions about politics- especially when she bashes those who are not liberals as she clearly is
It is very inappropriate
Especially when she promotes compassion
Surrender
Understanding
And love
Why does she want to espouse the disrespect and vitreal that is so divisive in this country
I would respect her more if she would stick to her area of expertise
And at the minimim promote
Tolerance of the opinions and values of others- even if they are not her values and beliefs"
620,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Best Energy Reader & Empath Guide,5,"I love listening to the Marie Manuchehri podcasts.Marie & her engineer Benny are a great team.

622,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,A podcast to give you life,5,"For those of an empathic nature like me, there is much in the current world that causes anger, depression, frustration, and fear. Listening to Marie and several other podcasts gives me hope and courage to face these challenges. Her responses to callers about problems large and small are calming. They resonate on many levels for me. In addition, she hosts interesting and varied guests to share their experiences with her audience."
623,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,The Real Deal,5,"I've listened to every podcast Marie has ever done, I've had two sessions with her and I've been to one of her events.

She really has a gift,and this show is her gift to her listeners. Thanks Marie!"

628,The Marie Manuchehri Show...Where Energy and Medicine Meet,Always enjoyable,5,Marie's show is always interesting and enjoyable. Marie has such wonderful insight and her advice is always kind and thoughtfull. This show is also easy to listen to - many of the other interview shows I listen to have uneven sound and I am always turning the volume up or down to hear the host or guest - but not on this one - the sound is very even.
629,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Great questions to great topics,5,Varied but interesting podcast. Never dissapointed. Thank you
630,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Best Metaphysical Show,5,"I've listened to this show for several years now and I haven't found a better one yet on metaphysical/ personal growth topics. Ryan keeps things interesting and I love his guests. ""The Courage To Change Everything"" with Ken Foster is one of my favorites. Definitely subscribe to this show!"
631,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,This radio show changed our lives!,5,"A wildly addictive and compelling radio show!
The Outer Limits of Inner Truth radio show is truly limitless with the wisdom, knowledge, entertainment and the extensive variety of expert guests and topics featured!
OLIT is a true gift and a joy to listen to!
Host Ryan McCormick‚Äôs skillful, intelligent and thought provoking questions are out of this world. His sincerity and compassion are unsurpassed. His guests openly appreciate his engagement and knowledge.
As I say, if you haven‚Äôt been interviewed by Ryan McCormick, you have never been properly interviewed.
And if you could only listen to one radio show- choose The Outer Limits of Inner Truth.
-Mary Bass"
632,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,"Creative, original & informative",5,The Outer Limits is a fantastic source for metaphysical information. So many great guests on this show. The host is a truth seeker and has a real thirst for knowledge that comes across in every episode. Highly recommend!!

634,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Ryan that is a freaking awesome question,5,"I love this podcast, Ryan is a great interviewer and always has on interesting guests. Very wide range of topics are covered, anyone interested in fringe science, E.T.s, spirituality, the truth, etc. will love this show. Keep up the good work Ryan!"

636,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Open and fun discussions in Metaphysical matters,5,"I discovered this podcast(which is really a radio show) pretty recently and it has quickly become my favorite. Ryan does a fantastic job- he asks great questions, is non judgmental and is genuinely interested. I Love the topics discussed, I havenj't come across another show like this. One of my favorite aspects of this podcast is that he beings in multiple guests/ points of view on any given subject. My suggestion for a starter episode: 'How to Escape the Matrix of Control'."
637,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Metaphysics With a Sense of Humor,5,"Always look forward to your show!
I found you from a 2013 Tribute to Stuart Wilde and haven't stopped listening since. I studied his books and programs since the mid 90's and so grateful to find a community of people who are as inspired by him as I am.
Stuart's teachings contain a compassion for humanity and sense of humor that is beyond compare, and your show carries that essence forward.
Outer Limits of Inner Truth is funny, fascinating, insightful, and thought provoking. Thank you for what you do!"
638,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Great if you could hear the guests!,1,Looks like some great topics. What's with only hearing the questions ams not the guest's response???
639,Outer Limits Of Inner Truth,Introspective & Unique,5,The show is very interesting. It's like an episode of CSI only they are talking about where a person's soul is from. You learn about a person's past lives and what their future holds. Would love to see them get some more famous people on here!
640,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,So truthful,5,Thank you. Honest and insightful into how women try to manipulate their lives for love.
641,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,Love!,5,I really love this station! I hope there will be new episodes soon! Please make new episodes!!
642,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,Eben Alexander,5,Super interview. Doesn‚Äôt get much better!
643,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,*This One is Different*Host Stays ON Topic!,5,"Highly Recommended, without Any Reservations, whatsoever :)
Here's Why: Over the years, I've listened to; discarded; Sought; Found; Discerned; found Puerile; etc..., many and varied Podcasts concerning Paranormal, Psychic, UFOs; other Phenomena, and Issues. While many others may be, in and of themselves, very good, and--in spite of the hosts' irritating lack of either professionalism, bad audio, maturity, and/or Neutrality--most do have very good guests. *This One is Different*, though! THIS Host actually lets the Guest Speak, at length, about their Subject matter; sometimes, up to 1/2-hr, uninterruptedly. And when the Host Does Ask questions, they're actually **Relevant** to What was/Is being said; nor are they leading or biased, in the least. Lastly, whether the Guests ""may"" have just released a new book, or not, the program stays *On Topic* regardless of if it is in that particular book, or someone else's. This Host also has the Ability to ""Cross-reference"" previous Guests' similar Topics, and ask the present Guest's View, relating to theirs and these Other Lightworkers' Work. A Superb Program!"
644,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,the spiritguides.co.uk,5,"Great interviews. Informative, insightful."
645,TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Network Radio,Very interesting!,5,"Came across this podcast, very intriguing and there aren't commercials etc., just straight talk."

648,JW: Watchtower (Study) (wE MP3),Truly the truth.,5,Everything that I learned from the witness has done nothing but enlightens me and helped me to have a better relationship with God. Jehovah‚Äôs Witness truly teach the truth. They always show from the Bible the truths they speak. Thank you.

650,JW: Watchtower (Study) (wE MP3),Pillar of Truth in support of True Christianity,5,"It is wonderful to find the truth is being taught in such a clear, understandable, and straight forward manner, free of the biased, erroneous human tradition interlaced with pagan belief and teaching so rife within false religion today. Thank you for proving Jesus words in John 13:35 that states true Christians would be identifiable by the love they would have, true."
651,JW: Watchtower (Study) (wE MP3),Terrible,1,They teach that Jesus is the archangel michael. Far far from the truth
652,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,CCN,3,Sorry guys but the newest addition to the crew is just angry and curses to the point of ignorance.
653,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Great podcast,5,I honestly have no experience or skills at review writing but don't let that deter you. This is an extremely interesting podcast. Check it out. Do it now!
654,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Excellent show on the occult,5,I am really glad I found this show. I am a huge fan of the Out There/Disinfo podcasts and this show is very similar except it tends to focus more on the occult. The show's host is very knowledgeable and always has good questions and insights that keep the guests thinking while at the same time getting us deeper into their experiences. My only suggestion is to seperate the music episodes from the interview episodes. Other than that keep up the great work.
655,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Kudo's to Ken & Co.!!,5,"Sitting Now is a great podcast with Ken and his crew as top-notch presenters and lots of great guests. I can't speak highly enough of the show, the music & the very cool website. Much luck & continued success : )"
656,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,"Wonderful guests, great hosts, thankfully not as geeky as it really could be",4,"Damn good podcast! Hard to find something of this flavor floating around: slick, well researched, non-nasal hosting, with a slant in the magic(k)al direction that's just right. Kudos to the men and women who've made it possible. Hail Eris!"
657,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Great podcast,4,Love listening to this podcast.... wish it came out more frequently though.
658,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Magical Aliens Make Love with Douglas Rushkoff in your Ear,5,"RWYASN is my third favorite podcast of all time. Which, considering Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is my third favorite record of all time, seems to put Ken and Co. in mighty fine company. I guess what I'm trying to say is this is the mind-altering modal jazz freakout of esoteric podcasts. Keep the new episodes coming! (Seriously. Put down the spliff, Ken, and do a new episode already.)"
659,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,please more podcasts,5,i like the sitting now cast butplease do more and stop the close doors feed on the same cast. i dont mind it but every time i get my hopes up that its downloading its a music cast so please more content!
660,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Third-eye laser surgery,5,"This mammoth of a podcast, produced by UK's Ken Eakins, keeps getting better and better. You'll find insightful interviews with leading authorities on topics like the occult, the paranormal, quantum physics, crypto-zoology--and a dash of conspiracy theory thrown in for good measure. The production is getting closer and closer to being top-notch. The tripped-out music at the end is a delight as well. Pefect for a ten-mile run. This is some third-eye laser surgery."
661,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Worth a try.,4,"I gave this a four star because it is worth listening to. That said there are some real yawners though that i skipped. There are some episodes that are very interesting and very worth the time. Ken, the host, started off rather nervous but is starting to sound more comfortable. If you can ignore the other co host paul at first, he sort of disapears eventually. He doesnt seem like a bad guy, Paul that is, but he does'nt do much. Sort of like a space saver. The show has some really good guests and if you like Bungle than you will like his taste in music. Plus if your a fan of Out There Radio than he has Raymond and Austen on a few times as co-hosts or as guests. All in All pretty good."
662,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Nice stuff!,4,"Really enjoying this show ‚Äî More Raymond Wiley, more UFOs, MORE WEIRDNESS Please... !!!"
663,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Good esoteric grab-bag,4,"Very much enjoying the show, kind of a ""man on the street"" perspective and introduction to all things mystical and occult."
664,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Great SHOW,5,This is a GREAT Podcast for any fan of the normal which we do not understand yet. Thanks for the Great episodes and keep them coming
665,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,I love this show!,5,"Engaging hosts and interviews, fascinating topics and excellent music..what more can you ask for? Not much. Download this NOW."
666,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,brain food,5,A very smart and informative podcast. Highly recommended for intelligent speculation and underground news items.
667,Right Where You Are Sitting Now,Fantastic Show!!,5,"If you liked the ""Out There"" podcast, this will be the show for you! Ken's format presents a variety of topics along with very informative guest interviews. Well done! Keep up the great work!!"
668,Psychic Viewpoint,Maureen,5,Wow I have become very talked about by what I have read!!!! Only a couple of reviews I am not mentioned...Thank you so very much for taking the time to write about me I am flattered...
669,Psychic Viewpoint,Terrible Host-scattered thoughts!!!,2,"Terrible Host! Listening to Maureen Halloran drove me crazy with her constantly scattered thoughts, partial sentences, going in every direction like a jackrabbit. The guest Rana George was great, but Maureen is a poor interviewer. I listen to podcasts all the time, but I won't listen to a pod cast with her again."
670,Psychic Viewpoint,Cant access podcast anymore!,2,"The show is great, but it won't download or listtend to the podcases. as it is giving an error in Itunes. When searching the web, the same things happen (a redirect errror is given on the web). I emailed the organization when this happened six months ago and they could never fix it. All of a sudden, the downloads started again, but those that were missed during the period where downloads wouldn't work could not be accessed.
Too bad as this show has some great interviews!"
671,Psychic Viewpoint,Scattered!,3,"* I typically don't leave reviews.... But I had to do this.*
I just recently stumbled upon this podcast and I absolutely LOVE the content and variety of topics they have.

There is one host on here that is very scattered. She doesn't finish sentences, giggles nervously throughout the show, breaths in the mic, and sounds like she's talking with a mouth full of food.
She's ruined my vibe during many of the shows, and I've had to turn it off.
In my opinion, some people are not cut out to be interviewers or hosts. Maureen, please get coaching to polish your skills, it would be appreciated."
672,Psychic Viewpoint,"Good show but.....,,",3,I agree that the host rambles which is so sad. We could all learn a lot more and frankly not feel so robbed of knowledge. I love this and i hope she is reading these reviews for soul growth.
673,Psychic Viewpoint,I'm TRYING!,2,"Hi Everyone!
I wanted to tell you how much I love the topics that you cover on the show. It is the only podcast I listen to! But I‚Äôve recently been waning in my listening because I get so frustrated with one of your hosts. She is very sweet and you can tell has a very tender heart, so I mean this with the utmost respect ‚Äì but she talks so scattered and so much over the guests and other hosts that it‚Äôs literally frustrating to even listen to! It‚Äôs made me turn off the podcast when I actually really wanted to hear what messages the guest had to give to the listeners.
I‚Äôm writing to tell you that I hope Maureen can stay with the show, but maybe bring someone forward to be the MAIN host so that we can LISTEN more to what the guests have to say than with how Maureen can relate it to her own life or how she has a similar story. I just want to be schooled in all of the awesome topics you guys have to cover.
Thanks so much. I hope you‚Äôll take this into consideration because I want to stay subscribed to the podcast!"
674,Psychic Viewpoint,Needs work,2,"Have listened to three of the podcasts but have pretty much run out of patience. The speakers /guests need to be a lot more polished, fluent and able to explain the concepts they work with. The banter ranges from cringingly awful to boring. The host should spend more time with his audience and less with himself."
675,Psychic Viewpoint,Mediocre,2,"The topics are hit or miss in their level of appeal and presentation. And yes indeed, one of the hosts just rambles and talks over other hosts and guests. It's irritating and distracting. She's a good psychic but poor host. And this crews' website (psychicaccess.com) denies people their ""free"" readings for obscure reasons that they won't disclose, even upon request. They tell you it's because your email or phone number has been used but do not take into account that both get reused frequently by the hosts/carriers. There are other psychic teachers and psychic shows much more fluent, organized, and upfront about their services."
676,Psychic Viewpoint,Let the guest talk please...,4,"I love idea behind show, and the Hosts who contribute; However, there's one thing that rattles my nerves and keeps me from listening to certain Podcasts. One of Hosts (won't say name), cross talks, over talks, mumbles, continues to giggle, and actually frys my nerves. Her nervous rumbling is exhausting. So many shows I've wanted to hear/learn from Guest but she interrupts with unintelligible nonsense. Shed be fine on limited cohort, but not as Lead. I've not been able to finish many shows because she needs grounded. Her energy needs work. Please!!!!"
677,Psychic Viewpoint,Good vibes.,5,I got a very warm feeling about this group. The show is well organized for there being that many people involved. Lots of caring going on here. great show.

Not to mention her voice is so melodic, a radio session listening to her voice is equivalent to meditation! Keep up the great work!

702,Conversations with Yogananda,Excellent,5,I started listening to this podcast a few months ago and caught up just yesterday. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and will be eagerly awaiting each new episode. Nayaswami Asha really enriches this book with her commentary and that was one of the things that kept me coming back for 45 episodes. I also appreciated the classroom discussion setting and the questions the attendees asked were also helpful to clarify issues for me. Listening has certainly shifted my consciousness for the better and has encouraged me to explore other related materials mentioned in the podcast that I was curious about. Keep it up and know that you have a friend listening with you each week.

Really appreciated her authenticity, love her southern charm, and her contagious enthusiasm for life... Would have listened to her throughout the holidays and new year, but my blessings in discovering her were delayed until recently... then shortly after I had, I dropped my phone in the toilet. Oops! Once I had replaced my phone I realized I lost all of my favorite podcasts, including this show... but I didn‚Äôt remember the name to subscribe! After searching around for Law of Attraction shows, without the cover art because the data on my phone was loading slowly, I selected a few. Played the first episode, not recognizing the name of the show, and was overjoyed to hear Constance‚Äôs voice!!! She‚Äôs ALWAYS saying how God led us to her show... I‚Äôm proof!

It took me a second to get used to her but once I did, I allowed hours of wonderful wisdom to flow into into my life. She has consistently great guests and she pours her heart into every show. Some of the best shows are when Constance is sharing some of the specific ways she has manifested her dreams. I've learned so much from listening to this podcast. It is one of the good ones, head and shoulders above the others. Constance rocks!"
708,"Think, Believe and Manifest Show",Constance Interviews Simon Bailey,5,"Constance, your decision and formatted questioning of Simon T Bailey was one of the most LOA audio interviews that I've ever experienced. It amazes me that The God of the Universe always has an abundance of wealth 2 share. You & Simon Rocked!"

719,Hidden Brain,Good thought and application,5,"High quality in thought, voice and production value. If you want to know more about how our brains work, this is the podcast for you."
720,Hidden Brain,Always on point,5,"Every time I listen to a new episode, it becomes my new favorite episode. This podcast constantly challenges me, makes me think, and I always learn something new and surprising. I feel more human when I‚Äôm listening."
721,Hidden Brain,Very Enjoyable,5,"I really enjoy listening to Hidden Brain and discovering what makes us tick. Shankar has a wonderful laugh, too. Many thanks!"
722,Hidden Brain,Exceptional,5,"I am a podcast junkie and listen to many podcasts weekly. Hidden Brain is definitely my favorite podcast by far. I‚Äôve gone back and listened to every episode and am excited when I see a new episode pop up on my feed. The podcast is well produced, thoughtful, and thought-provoking. Well done."
723,Hidden Brain,Where zen meets,5,Jam good Vedanth
724,Hidden Brain,Hidden Brain,5,I have been listening to your podcast and it has helped me understand why we behave the way we do. One subject that interests me is Borderline Personality.Perhaps in the future you can shed some light about this disorder. I enjoy your show and the guests that collaborate with you.Thank you Shankar!
725,Hidden Brain,Where zen meets ü§Ø,5,"This podcast is so informative about the human mind and it‚Äôs complexities. The content is so rich I often listen to the same podcast twice in a week to really let it sink in. Also I love the hosts voice, very relaxing"
726,Hidden Brain,Best podcast,4,"Hidden Brain is hands down the best podcast with the best host of any of the multitude of podcasts I‚Äôve listen to. It is insightful and provides timely information on important current topics. Additionally, the information is present in a positive manner without preaching. You feel the host is a friend who would enjoy a cup of coffee and a conversation with you. I can only hope the vision, content and delivery stay the course."
727,Hidden Brain,"Love the show, but ...",4,"... I can‚Äôt let slide a recent comment about the ‚Äútight‚Äù (i.e., rule-bound) Japanese culture as a result of a history of threat on the nation‚Äôs soil from without. What notable external invasions has it suffered since the 1500s (or before, for that matter), other than the atomic bombs dropped on its cities in the middle of the twentieth century? Does Japan‚Äôs own history of repeated invasions of, and existential threat imposed upon, its neighbors explain the relative tightness/looseness of China, Korea, etc.?"
728,Hidden Brain,A favorite,5,"The content is informational, interesting and well put together. The voice of the host is also so smooth and nice to listen to."
729,Hidden Brain,Great,5,Love this podcast. Ever since I listen to the first one ‚ÄúThe American Man‚Äù I‚Äôve been hooked
730,Hidden Brain,I recommend this podcast,5,One of the best podcast series - smart & with depth
731,Hidden Brain,Always interesting,5,"An interesting psychological view of many contemporary issues. Very thought provoking. Could use a bit of tightening up, faster speech."
732,Hidden Brain,Danger Extremely Soothing Voice,5,Shankar has one of those voices that is both soothing and credible. I often make the mistake of listening to these at bedtime and miss half the pod because his voice is so calming and I drift off. Great topics and so very well produced. Well worth adding to your listening library.
733,Hidden Brain,Tops,5,"Beautiful presentation,
Heartfelt and humorous too
Thoughtful and insightful
And a dreamy, reassuring voice
Thank you
Explores fascinating facets of all life and expands thoughts. Am very grateful to have found Hidden Brain and will share with others."
734,Hidden Brain,A lot of reruns without marking them as such,3,"I love Hidden Brain and Shankar, I started listening when it first came out and I love the things they cover but lately I feel like almost all the new episodes are reruns. And it‚Äôs hard to tell since the titles don‚Äôt indicate that they‚Äôre reruns. Any old time listeners have the same issue? I even try to find the titles of the recent shows, like this week‚Äôs ‚Äúclose Enough: Living Through Others‚Äù as a previous episode but I can‚Äôt, which leaves me confused since I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve heard the episode.
I wouldn‚Äôt mind the reruns if they were at least marked as such. The content is great, wish they kept producing like in the earlier years."
735,Hidden Brain,Incredible Content / Great Host,5,Shankar consistantly brings interesting topics to life. I have been left in awe by some of these episodes by the new perspective or understanding it has brought. They are always informative and a real pleasure to listen to. One of my all time favorites.
736,Hidden Brain,Informative and Captivating,5,"Easily one of my top favorite podcasts. The guests are consistently delightful to listen to, and possess a wealth of knowledge to learn from."
737,Hidden Brain,FAKE FAKE FALE,1,"The news here about the corona virus are complete fake,"
738,Hidden Brain,The only podcast I look forward to,5,"Thanks for consistently creating interesting content. I always talk about what I learn‚Äîyour ideas are concise, clear, and applicable.
Thank you!!!"
739,Hidden Brain,Smart Podcast,5,"Smart Host talks with Smart Presenters. Hidden Brain sneaks up on you and makes all sorts of topics not just interesting and thought provoking but entertaining. Shankar asks the good questions, not in a studious way, but in a curious way. The way I would want to ask it I could. Leaves me with a lot to talk and think about after the show. I recommend you give it a listen!"
740,Hidden Brain,"Great, but I have a question",5,"Terrific podcast but why can‚Äôt I get more recent programs in my podcast ‚Äúfeed? One on our unreasonable expectations of marriage? The one on FOMO (Fear of Missing Our)? I would be very grateful!!
Thanks for a great podcast!"
741,Hidden Brain,Love Shankar‚Äôs voice and his mind,5,"I could listen to Shankar talk about anything (apparently, as proven over the years) but more than that I am always interested in the topics he chooses to present. That‚Äôs solely because he‚Äôs a great story teller, because I can hear a similar topic somewhere else and not make it through 5 minutes, but the way Shankar offers up the subjects makes them attainable and enjoyable. Great listening for anyone. And the episodes are short and sweet."
742,Hidden Brain,Great for class!,5,Using this specific podcast for a world and regional geography class...it is perfect for it!
743,Hidden Brain,So Inspiring,5,"The work that the Hidden Brain team does is unparalleled. If you‚Äôve never listened to an episode, I would start with ‚ÄúCompassion.‚Äù It truly changed my perspective on the world and I‚Äôm so thankful that Shankar and the team created such important content. I listen to it every few months because it has such a profound impact on me. Thank you all so much!!"
744,Hidden Brain,A note about William the meme kid.,5,"I usually enjoy these podcasts but this one was just irritating to listen to. What an act by William. He‚Äôs the ‚Äúsloth‚Äù in his memes and he played you all to save his image. Even the host was fooled. You‚Äôre all shedding a tear for William the Privileged and listening to his dad do the typical defiant ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know my son!‚Äù routine. No we don‚Äôt know everything about William, but I know enough. It‚Äôs unfortunate that they painted him as a sympathetic figure in this podcast. That was William‚Äôs plan.
Otherwise great podcast, but this one was junk.
CLICK SEND."
745,Hidden Brain,10/10,5,"Hidden Brain is always fascinating, well written, and well produced. It continually expands my mind. Thank you for providing so much knowledge!"
746,Hidden Brain,Smart and fun,5,Great delivery of a fun podcast that you will feel good listening to.
747,Hidden Brain,Show about the change in the Indian society,5,"Hello,
Shanker our family loves your thoughtful and deeply researched podcast . All this coupled with your soothing calm deliver makes your show a treat!
I am wondering if you are working on a show about the political situation in India. There is much to report as there is paradigm shift in the fabric of society in India in last few years"
748,Hidden Brain,Excellent podcast,5,This is one of the most interesting podcasts I listen to. It is well researched and presented like a detective story‚Äî but it is fact based. Well worth your time!
749,StarTalk Radio,"Can be great, or not so great.",2,"Depending on the subject matter, usually a great listen. Getting to deep into politics, sports, religion and climate change did my taste. Please stick to science."
750,StarTalk Radio,Mostly enjoy,4,"I do enjoy the show and the comic relief is excellent..Neil makes science very interesting and entertaining, my only slight of the show is at times,,... it has a liberal slant."
751,StarTalk Radio,Much love for Chuck Nice,5,Love Chuck. He brings great questions and an inquisitive mind while also making us laugh. He and Neil have a wonderful camaraderie that beings me back for every episode.
752,StarTalk Radio,funny and informative,5,"a lot of times when you listen to science, it‚Äôs not always interesting and sometimes dry but Neil and Chuck keep it light and funny so the average man can follow. Also trying to hear Chuck pronounce peoples name is funny as hell"
753,StarTalk Radio,Great but...,1,I can‚Äôt handle this show anymore.... the guys that are co-hosting are rude and immature. It‚Äôs a shame because Neil did a great job.
754,StarTalk Radio,Chuck...,3,"Chuck: 5% is funny. 30% is indifferent. 65% is annoying. Why restate every question in a less articulate way?
100% of the other comedic sidekicks are better. Go away or just stop talking. Agree with others: when Chuck is introduced makes me tune out.
Love me some NDT. More Bill Nye too. Please and thanks!"
755,StarTalk Radio,Chuck.. my man...,4,"Love the show. Truly awesome, but if Chuck interrupts another guest on the show, I‚Äôm out. Please for the sake of us wanting to hear unabridged answers to questions which are sent it and also guest insight, shut it."
756,StarTalk Radio,Expectations blown into another dimension.,5,"Came here for knowledge and more in-depth explanations of space, but in return I was flabbergasted and thrilled to see myself laughing because of the humor and deep connections on each episode!! I can‚Äôt tell you enough how happy I am to always came back for more. Thank you for the laugher and excitement. Deep love, your fan."
757,StarTalk Radio,Why so childish?,3,Used to love Star Talk. Learned and laughed. Now it's just silly and annoying interruptions of guests.
758,StarTalk Radio,Abortion positive sponsor?,2,Is this podcast now so bad that the only sponsors they can get are from abortion advocacy groups?
759,StarTalk Radio,Long time first time,5,"Came for the science, stayed for the banter."
760,StarTalk Radio,Allegations,1,Allegations
761,StarTalk Radio,Love this show,5,Great show. Neil is by far the greatest astrophysics communicator I‚Äôve heard he just shows so much enthusiasm it‚Äôs great. Have a tough time listening to playing with science though. Love chuck but Gary is kinda sort of extremely dry and boring when he speaks.
762,StarTalk Radio,Love it!,5,"It‚Äôs like a portable comedy show mixed with science, which is everything I want!"
763,StarTalk Radio,COVID-19 episode,5,"Just wanted to say they didn‚Äôt downplay the Corona virus, just analyzed the data. (I‚Äôm in Korea right now). It seems like America is more freaked out about it than the Koreans are. I blame the media and it being election year."
764,StarTalk Radio,Disappointed with Covid-19 episode,1,"So for a while, I have been very choosy in which Star Talk episodes I listen to. Chuck Nice isn‚Äôt always very nice to listen to, in fact he‚Äôs often a determining factor in if I turn an episode off or not. He and NDT sometimes fall into a very bro‚Äôs-club crass attitude or humor that I find very off-putting and sometimes outright offensive. In addition, they both have a habit of jumping in to make a ‚Äújoke‚Äù in the middle of one of their guest‚Äôs explanation of something they asked about and completely detailing the science-based answer. It‚Äôs like nails on a chalkboard to listen to and you can tell when the guests are exasperated, sometimes seeming annoyed as they wait for the juvenile hilarity to stop enough to actually answer the question. Darn shame too, because I‚Äôm more interested in science with a touch of humor than locker room humor with a touch of science.
The last straw - in a time when *every other* news or science podcast I listen to is able to interview, produce, update and release an informative podcast about the novel coronavirus and covid-19, Star Talk releases a week old interview with only a ‚ÄúPSA‚Äù from NDT at the top saying ‚Äúthings are changing quickly, check with your local authorities, because I‚Äôll probably have to do this PSA again next week, haha‚Äù. Why is it that other podcasts take the time to make sure their information is updated, even when the interviews are a week (or more!) old? Some of my favorite information podcasts have updated and rereleased older episodes with current information, so listening to this was like listening to one of those from 10 days ago. A ridiculous amount has changed in the week making listening to the covid-19 episode the lowest priority on my listening list right now, possibly making it a candidate for the deadly ‚Äúswipe left - delete‚Äù.
ST, make a choice- if you are going to report on the coronavirus, up your game and figure out how to keep your podcast from being immediately outdated before you post it, or stick to longer-term science that we can use to explore (and escape) our other science podcasts that are able to keep up. Tip: since so many other good podcasts are keeping up with the news, maybe if you want to podcast about the novel coronavirus, reach out and share the publicity love by getting permission to rebroadcast someone else‚Äôs podcast. You already do it with PWS, so use that skill to your advantage with this."
765,StarTalk Radio,Great show,5,Always interesting. Love the new people it introduces me too.
766,StarTalk Radio,Lost respect for Mr. deGrasse Tyson,1,Very disappointed with COVID-19 episode. Seems they were really trying to downplay it. Also seemed like they were about a week behind with their data.
767,StarTalk Radio,Extra content,3,"This podcast now includes his sports podcast too. I would rather see the sports stuff on a completely different podcast. It gets bulky and tedious to download the episode and then delete it when I realize it is sports content that I have zero interest in. I don‚Äôt mind when occasional episodes are brought in as a promo in between seasons, but this is too much. At least put sports podcast in the title. Rant over."
768,StarTalk Radio,Understanding COVID-19 Episode,5,"I normally love Neal, and was excited to hear expert opinion on COVID -19 threat. Unfortunately, this episode did a great disservice to his audience. The expert seemed more interested in making a political statement then discussing the risks, made little to no mention about the great impact on health care systems, postulated that the disease was no worse than the seasonal flu, and provided no meaningful data nor mention of its status as a Global Pandemic. I assumed this podcast was recorded in January when the threat was not fully understood, but it was released TODAY!, at the same time the CDC is shutting the country down. In the end, I knew more about the true risks of this virus a month ago. Is this the case of personal opinions blinding scientific truth?"
769,StarTalk Radio,Soooooooooo ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,"Lol I love Star Talk! üí´
Drink every time you hear Sooooooo...
Seriously, it‚Äôs a great podcast. A fun, entertaining way to enjoy science. üòä
Idk how can hate Bill or Neil or Chuck lol
Great show great people and great topics"
770,StarTalk Radio,Bill Nye is TERRIBLE,5,"Love Neil and Chuck. Chuck sometimes ask great questions a lister may ask. He also brings another side of Neil out and can get him going on tangents or side stories.
Neil knows material inside and out, and often has other guests on when a topic may reach beyond his knowledge or field. But he also crosses over to all kinds of fields like biology or chemistry... or history!!
The only time I can‚Äôt get through an episode is when Bill Nye hosts or is a guest. Between his slightly odd and racist Netflix special where he encouraged a comedian to make fun of white people. Lol I tuned in and did not understand why a ‚Äúscience‚Äù guy would encourage a guest to draw line and make fun of an entire group of people. Bill also get angry or upset when others disagree, and when his hypothesis are questions by actual scientist (he has a bachelors degree mechanical engineering... which is an achievement. But not a scientist. Drives me crazy."
771,StarTalk Radio,Great podcast,5,"Everyone who is curious to know the truth about the universe, reality, and where the boundaries of our knowledge currently stand, this is the podcast for you. You will also probably laugh a few times per podcast. Which is always good."
772,StarTalk Radio,Was a favorite,1,"This was one of my favorite podcasts. Unfortunately, they decided that instead of high quality ad reads by the hosts, anyone unable to pay for yet another subscription must now be subjected to pre-packaged, often offensive, generic advertisements. Dumping sports garbage into a space/science podcast was bad; demonstrating they only respect the costal elite is unacceptable. Unsubscribed."
773,StarTalk Radio,Love me some Neil DGT,5,Great guy. Great podcast. Fun to learn and laugh simultaneously. Shout out to Chuck too. Laughing with you now as I listen and write this. Neil you‚Äôre infectious in a good way and always have stimulated my fascination and learning about the Cosmos and Science. I know you do that for millions around the globe. I can‚Äôt wait to see you live and hope to see you on Nye‚Äôs podcast too. Much respect for you both. üññüèΩ
774,StarTalk Radio,Peaks and Valleys,1,"I have loved this podcast for years; however, as time goes by, Neil deGrasse Tyson has become increasingly arrogant. This past week, he made an ethnic stereotype comment to Charles Liu and then treated him disrespectfully, ‚ÄúI am not going to go down that hole with you. Look at him nodding and smiling...‚Äù. Thank you for rising above Dr. deGrasse Tyson‚Äôs condensing attitude Dr. Liu."
775,StarTalk Radio,Talking over Guests,3,"One of the best concepts about StarTalk are the amazing guests that come on the show to talk about their specific fields of expertise. In one of the latest episodes with Bill Nye hosting, he continued to interrupt and talk over the guests. Please please stop doing this. Not only is it disrespectful it‚Äôs very annoying to listen to. Yes, we all know you are knowledgable Bill, but just pause, take a breath and let them finish their comments. Thanks"
776,StarTalk Radio,Entertaining astrophysics,5,"This is entertaining and often cutting edge science, but made for the sports or pop culture junkie."
777,StarTalk Radio,Hooked on the stars!,5,My son has been obsessed with Neil since he was 10 and got me hooked too! So flipping interesting and I am always learning something I always wanted to know! ‚ù§Ô∏è
778,StarTalk Radio,What happened to the music?,4,"I tuned out for a while, and now that I‚Äôm listening again, it seems they switched feeds and no longer feature the clever song selections to lead in and out of commercial breaks. I love this podcast, but hearing the same synth/EDM song over and over again starts to grate on my nerves."
779,Invisibilia,Combos,5,I learn something worthwhile with every podcast.
780,Invisibilia,The best of the best!!!,5,"This podcast is so amazing!
The amazing reporting, fabulous voices and so many diverse topics; everything from a place where bears live in harmony with humans to Someone who raise an A.I. Therapy robot like her son.
Really, it‚Äôs amazing please give a listen.
‚Ä¢
I wish That with this one review I could single handedly make all reviews 5 Stars. They really deserve it, it makes me so sad to see some of the lower reviews."
781,Invisibilia,Great show!,5,"I love this show. Thought-provoking reflections on what goes on inside us, what makes us who we are, and how we look at ourselves and the world."
782,Invisibilia,Bad at Journalism,1,"Sometimes I think one of the hosts on this show is astoundingly dumb and lazy.
In one episode, she claims that a woman who had been raping an underage suicidal boy is actually his victim! She goes on and on trashing this child male rape victim while defending his female rapist. It was really sick, and I am astounded something so offensive and DUMB was ever aired.
In another episode she tries to track down a mysterious ‚Äúdouble‚Äù of her boyfriend on Tinder. (It‚Äôs obviously her boyfriend cheating on her.) She never finds the owner of the profile, and she is too lazy to change subjects for the episode, so she just makes up a fake conversation that she feels she would have had with the fraudster (whoeveryone knows is actually her cheating BF). I cringed at her willfully ignorant and lazy work ethic!"
783,Invisibilia,Please listen!,5,"This podcast NEVER fails to move me. Every episode is deeply thought-provoking and well done. I always come away feeling like my mind expanded a little bit, like the world feels a little more profound, a little more human. I appreciate this podcast so much and encourage everyone to listen to it!"
784,Invisibilia,Go deep,5,Makes me feel like I‚Äôm in college at 2 am in a great mind blowing discussion. Taking me deep‚Äîlove Invisibilia
785,Invisibilia,Stellar!,5,"Thanks, you guys, for such an incredible podcast. Sometimes I wish we got follow up on some of the stories."
786,Invisibilia,Fantastically interesting,5,Always learn new things from this show. Storytelling is well-paced and not overwhelming. 10/10 would recommend.
787,Invisibilia,Hasn‚Äôt been the same,2,"The first season was very interesting. Now, it only seems to spotlight a certain political agenda. Some of the hosts‚Äô voices are unbearable to listen to."
788,Invisibilia,One of the best,5,"This podcast is beautifully produced and always thought provoking. With over 700K podcasts to choose from, I listen to some of these episodes several times over. That‚Äôs just how good this is."
789,Invisibilia,A new way to look at the world,5,"All the things that cross your subconscious mind in an hour podcast. From love to race to morality, you can explore anything. The hosts are absolutely amazing."
790,Invisibilia,always worth a listen,5,I am never disappointed by the episodes I listen to even when I‚Äôm only listening for ASMR reasons!
791,Invisibilia,Great. Simply great!,5,Just listen to this...
792,Invisibilia,My favorite podcast,5,Just amazing. Keep up the good work!
793,Invisibilia,Love this podcast!!,5,Very interesting topics that have personally helped me in my personal life
794,Invisibilia,Invisibilia,5,My favorite podcast ... Frame of Reference has helped me explain to my grandchildren how to look at life. Thanks to all of you ‚ù§Ô∏è
795,Invisibilia,One point,4,"All good but why why why feel the compulsion to add all that moog rock beat to what are gorgeous natural sounds? Especially annoying for me, a nature appreciator; a birder; a classical musician, and most of all, someone listening to a story about disruptions by humans of sounds and survival of our animal co-habitants!"
796,Invisibilia,A sprinkle of joy,5,I loved the latest season! Your thoughtful and well told real life stories make me feel connected to other people in these trying times. Thank you for bringing a little joy into my life every week.
797,Invisibilia,Great info and great personalities,5,"If you like smart discussions on interesting topics, you will love Invisibilia."
798,Invisibilia,Top talent,5,"Been listening since the beginning and I‚Äôm consistently surprised with stories and facts and ideas, and always sad when I‚Äôve reached the end of a season. I hope these keep coming for a long time. Excellent editing and producing and all of that. Love!"
799,Invisibilia,The first season was fabulous but...,2,"The first season was fabulous but has never returned to its glory days since. The first season contains one my favorite podcast episodes of all time, so for me to choose to stop listening is such a disappointment. I‚Äôm typically a ‚Äúbitter ender‚Äù and stick with things regardless but, there are so many other podcasts around these days, I just can‚Äôt... If you have the time, listen to the first season. But beyond, it‚Äôs not worth listening. They cover the same stories as other podcasts (like hidden brain and science vs) but in an overproduced, clumsy way. And if they happen to find a unique story, it‚Äôs‚Äîto put it as frankly as possible‚Äîdumb. They try to hype it up with all sorts of self-importance and production for the episode to only be about nothing."
800,Invisibilia,NPR Voice + Vocal Fry,2,The NPR Voice + Vocal Fry is just painful.
801,Invisibilia,Educational and beautifully produced!,5,Educational and beautifully produced!
802,Invisibilia,always leaves me thinking about it afterward,5,"I‚Äôll never forget listening to the first season about blindness, but each season has it‚Äôs own jewels throughout. Keep it up and thanks for always being so fresh with your stories and ideas!"
803,Invisibilia,Informative,4,All of the episodes are very interesting but I liked previous episodes because they were a bit shorter
804,Invisibilia,The best podcast out there,5,"Storytelling that makes you laugh, cry, rejoice, and learn something about the world and yourself. Can‚Äôt be recommended any higher"
805,Invisibilia,An Invisible But Audible Force,5,"Few activities of mine are as efficient and rewarding than walking for exercise with wireless earbuds listening to Alix Spiegel, Hanna Rosin or Lulu Miller! You‚Äôve become an invisible force shaping my views, opinions and even behavior!"
806,Invisibilia,Engaging and interesting!,5,"Really interesting topics, presented in a thoughtful way. Thanks so much Invisibilia crew!"
807,Invisibilia,Such Great Topics & Productions,5,Huge huge huge fan of this show ! Such Great Topics & Productions. Everyone should give a listen!

I love the mix of science and cultural topics. I just hope they keep putting out content so we can all still be listening g five years from now.
811,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Awesome podcast!,5,"I rarely write reviews, but I love this podcast so much, I‚Äôm making an exception. The beginning was a little rocky, but ever since Robert, Christian, and Joe took over it has been phenomenal. They do excellent research and present it well. Their intellect shines through, but they do an awesome job of breaking down these these complex concepts so you don‚Äôt have to have a PhD to comprehend. I listen every day. Keep it going!"

815,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,This is the right balance...,5,"This podcast strikes a good balance between communicating interesting scientific information and building personal rapport with the listener. I highly recommend them.
I'm a pastor and it is amazing to me how often they talk about something I can use as an illustration when I am preaching. Peace."

820,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,5,"What amazes me is that this show has been around for over 10 years, albeit not under the same name. Totally worth it to listen to, I think I first got into this show by way of getting a ride from a coworker from our temporary office at Easter Seals in Lakewood, CO, where he would drive me to another bus stop further North."
821,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Interesting and nicely quiet,5,Love the interesting stories and the calm voices and straight-up conversation. I personally can‚Äôt listen to podcasts with ‚Äúsoundscapes‚Äù so this one is great for me. No-stress listening with lots of new ideas.
822,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Adelaide,5,"I enjoy this show as Robert and Joe have great speaking voices and the topics are well researched.
Thanks Guys!"
823,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Interesting topics,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to STBYM for a few years now, and I noticed lately that I can‚Äôt un-hear Robert‚Äôs fake laughter that another listener pointed out. I‚Äôm taking a break (maybe for now), but here‚Äôs my 5 stars for whatever it‚Äôs worth, and All Hail the Great Basilisk!"
824,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Horseshoe Crab,5,Suuuuupppper show! Wow! Love these kinds of shows! Thx!
825,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,ü§Ø,5,Just started listening last night and heard the Netflix Bandersnatch episode.. Then went to bed and dreamed I discovered a whole new alternate ending for Bandersnatch.. talk about ü§Ø
826,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,ehh,2,they tend to talk in circles. just continually reiterate. they should call this show ‚Äúwe will make you sick of interesting topics in one hour.‚Äù make it a 20 minute show and it‚Äôd be perfect. god bless take care. -j dermen
827,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Brings out the inner geek or scientist in you,5,"This podcast is very good, I enjoy it very much. The hosts grab varied subjects and discuss many scientific aspects of them in plain language, simple and funny way. I enjoy the episodes very much. Recommended!"
828,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,WoW,5,"Thoughtful & insightful - may have even changed the way I feel about my own opinion on Ancient Alien Origin Theory- scratch that - Religion haha ‚Äî PLEASE a Part 2, 3! Wonderful Work!"
829,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Consistently great.,5,"Always fun and fascinating. Even when the topic seems like something I wouldn‚Äôt be interested in, I listen anyway because I know the hosts will find an intriguing angle to explore. One of my favorites."
830,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Awesome,5,Very informative and interesting
831,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,"subjects, hosts, insights",5,"the subjects chosen are of interest and great breadth. the hosts conduct fantastic research, bolstered by the knowledge they already have. their personalities and humors join in symbiosis that is a remarkable listening experience. i constantly feel rewarded with love, enjoyment, change of mind, new knowledge, insights, and a feeling of gratitude."
832,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Gratitude,5,Your podcast was so timely. We usually start our thanksgiving dinner with a prayer. It squashes any hostilities that or confrontations that may arrive. We stay away from politics and opening old wombs. Stay away from hot button issues and you can have an enjoyable dinner.
833,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,The real science of sci-fi and myth,5,"I LOVE this podcast! One of my go-to‚Äôs for many years now. The first episode I ever heard was their exploration of the biology of Dune, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I especially love their episodes about biological and ecological subjects. They‚Äôre very well researched and professional but still so enjoyable to listen to. If you have an interest in science and folklore/myth, you‚Äôll love this podcast!"
834,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Excellent scientific entertainment,5,"An always super entertaining, while also being a bit more scientific minded, look at tons of endlessly fascinating topics. I also love that they almost always bring actual scientific papers into the discussion. The hosts are fabulous as well."
835,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Great show,5,"Very entertaining subject matter save the recent plug about the yoga book...Straight TRASH! Keep up the good work. Remember, you only have one soul, so don‚Äôt sell it!"
836,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Great job fellas.,5,Love listening to the podcast at work. People think I‚Äôm crazy when I just start randomly laughing.
837,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,Great! But has annoying ads,4,"I really like this podcast especially the flares from infinity Sagittarius a*. But the ads definitely seem to be the downfall of this podcast. I have just one question PLEASE do a Steven Universe the movie vault episode about spinel‚Äôs injector!!!
PLEASE"
838,Stuff To Blow Your Mind,on thin ice,1,"Sponsored content? Do we get money too? Only way I'll listen, that is"
839,Sword and Scale,The COVID Episode lost me,1,Big fan before the COVID-19 episode.
840,Sword and Scale,Stay in your lane,1,"The condescending tone of the narrator has always been just barely worth putting up with as the content isn‚Äôt actually half bad, but the injection of conspiracy theories (ironically in the 4/22 episode directly after criticizing conspiracy theories,) misguided and self contradictory right wing politics and opinions that would embarrass even a stoned college kid are the last straw. This podcast and it‚Äôs narrator are crap."
841,Sword and Scale,Good stuff,5,Good stuff with raw honest opinion. Take it or leave it.
842,Sword and Scale,What‚Äôs not to love?,5,"For me, this is the best podcast. I listen to Daily S&S, regular S&S, and recently subscribed to Plus. I am captivated by how truly monstrous humans can be.
Hey Complainers,....don‚Äôt f*#king listen if you don‚Äôt like it, in fact - if you think you‚Äôre so great try making something better to entertain the masses.
‚≠êÔ∏èI‚Äôd give 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è if I could‚≠êÔ∏è"
843,Sword and Scale,Devolved into a complete sh*tshow,1,"I‚Äôm not proud to admit that I listened to this drivel for years, even through all the host‚Äôs bad choices and narcissistic whinging. I finally unsubscribed today because I can no longer handle the poor writing and anti-intellectualism. The latest coronavirus crimes episode is pure fake news and political propaganda. Both the host and guest lack any real understanding of politics, economics, and history."
844,Sword and Scale,Get back to murder,1,I don‚Äôt care about your politics. I‚Äôm here for murder. And this isn‚Äôt cuz I disagree with your ramblings. I‚Äôm just not interested if I want politic stuff I‚Äôll go to a political pod. Keep it up and I‚Äôm out. I know one in a million don‚Äôt matter but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone...
845,Sword and Scale,Two thumbs up!,5,Enjoying this podcast! So many episodes to binge! I like how it gets to the point and has actual recordings of interviews and 911 calls. It‚Äôs a unbiased view.
846,Sword and Scale,"Excellent, but host is going downhill",4,"This is still one of my favorite podcasts, but i doubt that it will be for long. Feels like Mike is struggling with the pressure of being a semi-public figure and spends part of each episode passive aggressively addressing haters. This content is not relevant to anyone who is not on social media or who doesn‚Äôt pay attention to behind-the-scenes drama.
I really do enjoy the stories and the audio (police interviews, 911 calls, courtroom testimony - all of that stuff is super interesting to me). I also feel that the stories that are chosen are always really fascinating.

However, I choose not to be on any social media since I am not into drama. It annoys me that it‚Äôs forced down my throat with the snide comments made on the air about people who aren‚Äôt fans. I‚Äôm here for the true crime, and the stupid drama doesn‚Äôt appeal to me."
847,Sword and Scale,"Plus for Storytelling, Minus on Political Posturing",4,"I really enjoy the storytelling style and most of the content. However, there is a lot of bias involved in the way stories are spun, criticism of ‚Äúthe media‚Äù and ‚Äúthe left‚Äù don‚Äôt really pertain to the stories being told. I wish the journalism had less opinion involved in the stories being told."
848,Sword and Scale,Covid episode,4,"Great episode, let‚Äôs not forget the president also held rallies after Pelosi invitation to China Town."
849,Sword and Scale,Profoundly interesting!,5,"It‚Äôs creepy, it‚Äôs entertaining, it‚Äôs informative....it‚Äôs literally everything! Continue the awesome work, Mike!"
850,Sword and Scale,Absolute best!,5,I became obsessed with this podcast the first time I heard it. I really enjoy the real audio and you can tell so much work goes into each episode.
851,Sword and Scale,Turning away from crime into politics.,2,"I used to love this podcast, now it‚Äôs full of garbage ranting and politics. Such a shame.."
852,Sword and Scale,Love it!,5,"Amazing story teller, best ever!"
853,Sword and Scale,Trumplican political propagandist,1,"I stuck with this podcast through all the drama but now must Unsubscribe. The April 22, 2020 leaves no doubt that Mr Boudet is a trumpist far right propagandist."
854,Sword and Scale,Great Stuff,5,"Made the mistake of listening to this podcast first, now it has set the benchmark for all others to surpass. I enjoy the real-life audio as it gives the listener the true perspective of the events as they happened in real time."
855,Sword and Scale,Love this podcast!,5,This is my favorite podcast.
856,Sword and Scale,Best Podcast,5,"I literally hate podcasts, I can‚Äôt stand to sit and listen to someone talk. But this podcast pulled me in on the very first episode. I have almost completely caught up on every episode! I‚Äôve told all my friends and they love it too"
857,Sword and Scale,The best,5,Absolutely love this podcast! No other true crime podcasts compare.
858,Sword and Scale,The best,5,I just want to say this is the best crime podcast been listen for awhile . I use this podcast to compare to others and I have to say none of them measures up. You guys are #1 keep it up.
859,Sword and Scale,Great podcast,5,"Don‚Äôt understand why people are forgetting this is a podcast, its a majority of story telling and an individuals personal opinions. Dislike, unsubscribe and move on. You‚Äôre just as ignorant for shaming someone else for their opinion. Don‚Äôt understand why people forget the hypocrisy in that. *facepalm*
Love the music, love the story telling keep it up!"
860,Sword and Scale,Sword&Scale,3,"The stories seem interesting, but the constant garbled audio clips on each episode are too hard to understand. It would be better if the host would just read a transcript or give a summary. I have to give it up. I tried."
861,Sword and Scale,Best,5,"It‚Äôs the best for the stories, audio, and sassy sound. Unfortunately for me I randomly picked sword and scale as the first crime podcast to ever listen to. Now nothing else can live up to such standard!"
862,Sword and Scale,Terrible,1,True crime at its absolute worst & most exploitative. The writing is awful. The music is bizarre. The rants are absolutely cringe worthy.
863,Sword and Scale,Listen to the first and last episode...,1,"To Mike Boudet: I can‚Äôt imagine you are unfamiliar with this criticism, but I‚Äôm here to remind you, as as journalist, that ethical posturing and a snide demeanor obstructs any honest work you present.
Podcasts can and should evolve, but this is a digression. I understand why a lot of listeners are unimpressed and unsubscribing."
864,Sword and Scale,Use to be the best..,2,"Long time listener and there‚Äôs no question that this is still one of the best podcasts when it comes to production quality, but man.. What happened to Mike? I stuck through all that drama when he would rant for a good 10 minutes before getting to the actual content, but now he just seems permanently bitter. A lot of victim blaming and bias views that makes it difficult to listen to. It use to be just good storytelling. Shame."
865,Sword and Scale,Piece of garbage human,1,"Mike Boudet might be one of the biggest jerks out there. He is a misogynist, bully and his podcast has gone in the trash"
866,Sword and Scale,Sword and,5,I don‚Äôt like the music that‚Äôs being played it‚Äôs to distracting it‚Äôs just not right it needs to be softer and more interesting I like Mike a lot stepped away for while but I‚Äôm back to !!!!
867,Sword and Scale,What happened?,2,I had not listened to S&S in a while having taken a break from true crime but when I decided to revisit this podcast which used to be one of my favorites I found the host interjecting way too much victim blaming and judgemental tone into the stoires. Also the music was wildly out of place now. I went on the reivews to see if it was just me and obviously it is not. Too bad.
868,Sword and Scale,Good podcast,5,"I was introduced to this podcast searching for Dan Zupansky who hosts True Murder. This podcast episode covers Zupansky‚Äôs book Trophy Kill. Not only did I learn a lot about Dan‚Äôs previous work, the subject was one of the creepiest I have ever heard covered. If that episode doesn‚Äôt give you the creeps, you either don‚Äôt have a heart or soul. I very much disagree with the one star reviews here, especially the one covering the Bakersfield Murder of the baby by his mentally ill father. In my opinion it was covered with honesty and sensitivity, not exploitative as alleged. But go ahead and decide for yourself!! I think this is a very good true crime podcast."
869,BrainStuff,"I generally like this podcast, but...",4,‚ÄúPositively charged electrons‚Äù. Really?
870,BrainStuff,üëçüèª,3,To the host: please talk at a normal speed. It sounds absurdly sped up. The content is great.
871,BrainStuff,Please just speak like a human,2,Pretend you‚Äôre talking to a friend instead of conducting a high school speech.
872,BrainStuff,Annoying robotic voice,2,"The host‚Äôs voice is annoyingly robotic. You can actually hear her sharp breaths in before she starts each sentence. Great information, but I just can‚Äôt stand her voice."
873,BrainStuff,Robot or human,1,Is that voice a robot or human? I get why so many reviewers compare her to Alexa. I could not get through one episode. So annoying.
874,BrainStuff,"Great content, bad delivery",3,"I was so excited when I stumbled upon this show because the topics are very interesting and I like the bite size length of the episodes. The content is great, but I am going to stop listening to the show because the woman‚Äôs voice and cadence are so sing-song-y and fake. It‚Äôs annoying and distracting. Her insanely audible and predictable gasps are also very annoying and distracting."
875,BrainStuff,‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù Vogelbaum,2,"Yes, I know her name is Lauren, but if I wanted to listen to a robotic voice I could just talk to Alexa.
I‚Äôm a new listener and have listened to old and new episodes. The older hosts speaking more naturally made it a 5 star podcast. The content is still good but her delivery is horrid. Not smooth or natural. On top of her robotic and unnatural delivery, her quick exaggerated inhales... it‚Äôs beyond me why she or the editors think the listeners enjoy them. I love the premise of the podcast. Please make it enjoyable again. I don‚Äôt want to unsubscribe."
876,BrainStuff,No longer for me.,2,"I used to put up with the absurd ad length, but now I‚Äôve caught up and the ads plus new host have rendered this podcast an unfortunate delete for me."
877,BrainStuff,Fact check on aisle doh!,3,Katrina was in 2005 #neverfirget
878,BrainStuff,Cloying voice,2,"My high school English teacher taught the girls in class not to perform their readings in the same cloying, sickly sweet, sing-song fashion we are subjected to in this podcast. Please find a professional presenter for this otherwise enjoyable program. Alternatively, send this one to a broadcaster school. Please."
879,BrainStuff,Slow Down,2,I appreciate the short podcasts but she is talking way too fast. I like to listen while I am doing other things and I can‚Äôt catch half of what she is saying.
880,BrainStuff,Very One Sided,1,"After listening to your one sided podcast on single use plastic bags I now have a hard time believing anything you say going forward. You seem to have an agenda. Plastic bags can and should be recycled. The recycled plastic resign can used to make other plastic such as trex lumber, plastic furniture, more bags etc. (any plastic item can use the resign). You should of give more than one side."
881,BrainStuff,Good content but...,3,"...the ads. I like having the choice for a short podcast in my library but half the podcast is ads bookended at the beginning and end with 1m -1m30s each, leaving only ~3 min for content. While I understand the need for ads and usually listen through the ads of my regular podcasts, Brain Stuff should reconsider the ratio of content to ads. 1:1 is not going to keep listeners coming back."
882,BrainStuff,Hard to listen to,2,"Can the sound engineer please fix Lauren‚Äôs gasping breaths? There‚Äôs no reason we need to hear that, we MUST have the technology, right? The gasping is so distracting I can‚Äôt absorb any information."
883,BrainStuff,"3 min of good content, 3 min of commercials",3,"The content is interesting and nicely presented. My issues is how 3 minutes of a single topic are sandwiched between 3 minutes of advertisements. I accept the need for ad revenue, but this is excessive.
Sadly, I decided to unsubscribe and listen to a similar podcast with a more reasonable ad to content ratio instead."
884,BrainStuff,Is this woman drowning? Someone help!,3,Why do you make this poor lady do the podcast while barely gasping for air!? She has so much great knowledge just let her breathe!
885,BrainStuff,Good content. Needs good host.,2,"Love the content, but I can‚Äôt listen to it due to Lauren Vogelbaums voice. The choppy robot speech and gasping is so distracting. Unfortunate because all the content is great."
886,BrainStuff,Great podcast,5,"I have been a long time subscription and my inner nerd enjoy learning new topics. The length is short enough for my attention span but I think some topics could be a few minutes longer for the hosts‚Äô sake so there‚Äôs less pressure to feel rushed. The most recent episode about the possibility of a fifth force is one of my favorites. I like Lauren‚Äôs voice, she speaks clearly and there is no vocal fry which is quite common these days."
887,BrainStuff,Love Lauren‚Äôs Delivery,5,"I‚Äôm also a fan of Lauren‚Äôs other shows: Savor, Foodstuff and Stuff of Life. I would like it if these episodes were 10 minutes long. At five minutes, the ratio of ads to content is on the high side.
OTOH, it‚Äôs great to see bigger sponsors like Lexus and Capital One come on board. Means all the good Stuff will continue!"
888,BrainStuff,Interesting stuff,3,"The lady has a great voice, but the way she breathes is so annoying"
889,BrainStuff,Informative and conscise,5,"The show presents useful information in a clear, concise format - perfect for our sound byte, short attention span world. Yes, the presenter speaks quickly but not too quickly at all. Her enunciation is clear and she is easy to understand.
(Side note/Arm chair analysis: Research shows people have problems with women‚Äôs voices. This may explain some of the more critical reviews.)"
890,BrainStuff,Good Stuff,4,"Great info in a simple clear form. The young lady talks too fast though. Listener is able to speed up if desired so she can slow it down to be more understood. ;)
Thank you for the great podcast!"
891,BrainStuff,awesome podcast,5,"Love this podcast, I learn a lot. The topics are super interesting. I like Lauren's voice , she is super easy to understand and I love how she breaths lol"
892,BrainStuff,"Sounds interesting, but I can‚Äôt",2,"I am certain that the topics are fascinating and I love getting info in digestible chunks like that, but it is very uncomfortable to listen to it. I tried multiple episodes and the person doing the podcast gasps between sentences because she is talking so fast. I don‚Äôt know if maybe some background music would help? The gasping is just too distracting for me."
893,BrainStuff,Good podcast,5,I enjoy these episodes
894,BrainStuff,Slow down,2,"I enjoy the podcast content but like many others, the host speaks too quickly for me to catch everything. I like the delivery from older episodes with the previous host. Even though episodes are short, I find myself playing some twice to catch everything."
895,BrainStuff,Too fast,1,I think she speaks way too fast. It‚Äôs difficult to listen to.
896,BrainStuff,Talks too fast,2,Her voice is too fast and robotic. Love the content though.
897,BrainStuff,What,1,They talk to you like you‚Äôre simple
898,BrainStuff,Need more Podcasts like this!,5,I am 33 years old & still have üß° to always learn more & keep up with these young brainiacs. The fact you guys get into all fields in science is great. Would love for you guys to make a podcast for forensic science.
899,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,A high quality podcast!,5,Great podcast! The SGU consistently puts our great content. The shows are always fresh and informative. Each rogue brings a unique perspective to the show!
900,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Listener for years,2,"Recently Cara has displayed such a politically biased woke take on everything it‚Äôs running a great show! It‚Äôs becoming hard to listen to despite the fact that the science is so fun to listen to. I‚Äôm not a Republican, never voted for Trump."
901,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,The Cara Show,3,"Cara dominates. Unfortunately. And with a decidedly political bent/agenda oozing with TDS. She seems to take it for granted that her political views are ‚Äútruth‚Äù. She wears her ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù proudly on her sleeve. So, two stars for Cara, four for Steven and bros, bringing it to three."
902,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Refreshing,5,"My husband and i have been listening for years whenever we have time for podcasts. I‚Äôve recently started dedicating more time to exercise so I‚Äôm listening while i do that and i just can‚Äôt say enough great things about this show. They are self effacing, funny, interesting, brilliant and just real people. I love how it teaches critical thinking and critical review of studies. I am a family medicine doctor and how they approach science is consistent with how I was trained."
903,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,THANK YOU for the incredible education in better understanding the world we live in,5,"I‚Äôve been a listener since 2006 and it took a pandemic for me to finally write a review (good suggestion Jay).
I can‚Äôt truly express my gratitude for this show and the wonderful critical thinking education I‚Äôve received from it. It has made me into a more confident (but humble) person that better understands an array of scientific, medical and general issues surrounding the nature of the world and how we as human beings operate within it.
If there is one podcast I wish the world would binge from episode 1 to today, it would be this one because we as a civilization would have a better foundation to understand how we know what we know which I suspect would lead to less nonsense and less conflict.
Thank you sincerely Novella bros, Cara, Evan‚Ä¶nothing but love, appreciate and respect to you all for everything you do!"
904,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,You,2,You still yhhymy
905,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Fantastic science podcast,5,"Can‚Äôt recommend enough. This podcast is great. Funny and entertaining, and it will help you to become a more critical thinker."
906,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Best Podcast on the Inter-webs,5,"Discovered this podcast in the summer of 2018 and quickly listened through the entire backlog of previous episodes. Now I try my best to space out listening to this Sunday-released show but have yet to make it past Tuesday before finishing it. I highly recommend this show to ANYONE as it covers a plethora of topics from astronomy and astrophysics, to biology and chemistry, to engineering. Easily the best podcast on the inter-webs"
907,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Safe Brain Workout,5,"The skeptics don‚Äôt pressure you into believing anything. They take current science topics and evaluate the evidence. They enjoy their work and talk science because they love the world. Truly one of the best parts of my week is listening to them attempt to set us free to see our existence as it really is. Whose That Noisy, Science or Fiction, and News Items of the week are regular segments that they use as platforms to discuss science practices and theories. Love it!"
908,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Triple threat,5,Get informed on current events and train yourself to think critically; all while being entertained.
909,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Wonderful,5,"Highly informative, sciency and nerdy, yet very entertaining. I‚Äôve learned a lot. Thank you!"
910,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,5 Star Content. 1 Star Audio Quality :/,3,PLEASE FIX THE AUDIO. The volume levels jump wildly depending who is talking and (I‚Äôm guessing here) whether they are keeping their mouths close to the mic. When I am trying to listen I have to constantly keep adjusting the volume. It‚Äôs very frustrating.
911,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Best scientific skepticism podcast,5,"Had I the authority, I would decree that every citizen of the world shall listen to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe weekly.
Seriously though, I have been listening since nearly the beginning and this show and crew are fantastic. The show manages the perfect balance of critical thinking, humor, science communication, and fun. Well produced, well organized and managed, all around a great show and the only podcast I listen to immediately when it hits my feed every week. I mean every week, I can‚Äôt remember them missing a week in the time I‚Äôve been a loyal listener, which is well over a decade.
Consider becoming a patron and supporting their outreach that way too, I have for many years and if you can afford to throw them a few dollars every month it‚Äôs well worth it to support them in their endeavors through the podcast, videos, and events to promote scientific skepticism and critical thinking to the masses."
912,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Great!,5,The only podcast I have been following weekly for about 10 years. Congratulations to all the team!
913,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Consistently excellent all these years,5,"I‚Äôve been listening since the beginning, well over a decade ago. They present well researched info in an interesting way on a wide variety of topics, and they tell you how to best skeptically evaluate info as they go. Just listen. You‚Äôll be glad you did."
914,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Absolutely amazing!,5,They are a nice breeze of fresh air. It is nice to know I can trust the news that is found here!
915,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Can not recommend enough!,5,"I discovered the Skeptics Guide to the Universe, when I saw their book of the same name in the bookstore where I work. I picked it up and could not put it down until I finished it. It‚Äôs by far my favorite non-fiction book I‚Äôve ever read. It has been my number one staff recommendation ever since! It really changed my view of the world and my own beliefs. I was so excited when I found out about the podcast and I haven‚Äôt missed an episode since!
If you are a curious person, who is always searching for the truth, and the latest scientific knowledge, then you‚Äôve found the right podcast!"
916,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Clarity from the noise,5,Discerning what is true is perhaps life‚Äôs greatest challenge. The hard work this podcast is doing has been a huge help. So much exciting science I‚Äôd never know about otherwise. I look forward to it every week and it‚Äôs the first podcast I listen to. Many thanks to you all!
917,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Addendum to my earlier review,2,I don‚Äôt mean to say that climate change doesn‚Äôt exist or is not a problem but they lack all skepticism about big government solutions. That‚Äôs all.
918,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Fantastic science show,5,A great show if you care about understanding our world.
919,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Hands down my favorite podcast,5,"This is a no nonsense, fact based, skeptical (duh) and entertaining podcast. Sure there are topics from time to time that don‚Äôt interest me but WAY more often I learn something new that was never a thought in my head."
920,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Show the love,5,"Been listening for over five years now. (Time flies) Because of this podcast, I have developed the critical thinking skills, respect for expertise, and solidarity for nerd culture and humanity in general. I went back to school, got into the teacher pipeline, and fought against grifters and pseudoscience hacks.
Times are tough, no income, and I can‚Äôt contribute back much at the moment, but I can write a review. I love you, rebel scum! I look forward to you every week."
921,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Love it!,5,Super awesome and informative show ! Been listening to it for 3 years now. Favorite is science or fiction.
922,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,My Facvorite Podcast,5,"I love this show, great way to learn about how to understand the world we live in and arm you with skeptical tools. This is one of the podcasts I have to listen to every week.
The team of rogues on this podcast are entertaining and informative, easy to get addicted to, while learning about science and how it works. Can't recommend it enough."
923,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Yo Jay I‚Äôm Reviewing the Podcast,5,My favorite podcast. It‚Äôs not often that you can say a podcast has changed your life but this podcast has.
924,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Amazing show,5,"I‚Äôve listened for 10 years now, every week. Can‚Äôt claim nearly a quarter of that for any other podcast out there."
925,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Most Important Podcast in the Universe,5,üöÄüõ∏
926,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Highly Accurate Information an Entertaining Format,5,"We live in a communication landscape littered with people shouting whatever they think that you want to hear, generally to profit off those deceived. In contrast, this podcast presents a rational look at the reality behind the hailstorm of nonsense that we find ourselves in.
Highly entertaining and extremely informative."
927,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Facts matter,5,Every weekend they gang brings relevant facts about interesting and poignant topics. I listen every Saturday afternoon!!
928,The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe,Fantastic podcast,5,I can‚Äôt recommend this podcast highly enough. It has helped me enormously in ways I can‚Äôt adequately describe here.
929,How To Do Everything,Terrific,5,Best podcast I have ever heard.
930,How To Do Everything,I just started,1,I just started listening and i think maybe somebody can post a review and help me
931,How To Do Everything,the best there has been or ever will be,5,truly so very sad that this ended. It was a weird little oasis. think about this show far more often than many podcasts I listen to currently.
932,How To Do Everything,Yay,5,üòÄ love this. In the pee Rex was there 20 dinosaurs ü¶ñ?
933,How To Do Everything,Awesome,5,I'm so sad that this podcast ended. The humor is right up my alley.
934,How To Do Everything,Best podcast,5,Best podcast there ever was. You have to get into it (like the office) but it is rewarding. I was heartbroken when they stopped making it. I still think of mike and Ian....üòî
935,How To Do Everything,Funny,3,It‚Äôs really good
936,How To Do Everything,So funny!,5,"OMG!So funny!Like,it is supposed to be a add and then it‚Äôs like‚Äù And you‚Äôll go into space.‚Äù"
937,How To Do Everything,Great Discovery!,5,"I started browsing for something new and I stumbled upon
‚ÄúHow To Do Everything‚Äù and I LOVE IT! I'm so excited because I‚Äôve got several years worth to listen to! I just wish the episodes were longer. I‚Äôm subscribing!"
938,How To Do Everything,Good Podcast,5,"Easy listen, good podcast"
939,How To Do Everything,You will be greatly missed,5,"This was one of my favorite podcasts. Not sure why it had to end but I'm guessing it was too intelligent and nuanced to be popular in the modern climate. Thanks for the laughs, fellas."
940,How To Do Everything,C'mon guys! Come back!,5,"This was one of the best weekly podcasts on iTunes. It's worth it to go back and listen to the whole catalog again, but it would be better if Mike and Ian just come back and relaunch the thing."
941,How To Do Everything,"Come back, guys.",5,I miss this show so much it kinda hurts.
942,How To Do Everything,"Not Quite Funny, Not Quite Interesting",3,"I wonder if the running time of the show would be better served if it were longer. As it stands, our hosts usually field one question and if it's not funny or interesting, there's nothing else to prop up the show. I heard a clip on Sampler where Justice Sotamayor was talking about baseball and the advice she gave about how to ""watch"" it was fabulous. Unfortunately, the shows I downloaded about naming a pet eagle and eating a human being weren't nearly as good."
943,How To Do Everything,Sad it's no longer around,4,I really liked this podcast. I searched for it several months after it had ended just to see if it mysteriously came back. I love the sarcastic humor.
944,How To Do Everything,Please come back!,5,Please bring this back. I miss it so much!
945,How To Do Everything,WHYYYYYY,5,Why they had to stop? But I loved it.
946,How To Do Everything,cool podcast,5,woah this is so good what the heck
947,How To Do Everything,Moset beyst podkats,5,tEH beset botcast
948,How To Do Everything,LOVE IT!,5,Please come back to podcast!I loved it they were hilarious!
949,How To Do Everything,Relistening,5,"I've been going back through the old episodes.... man, it holds up. I miss it so!"
950,How To Do Everything,Reminiscing,5,"I wish this hadn‚Äôt ended, it was truly fantastic"
951,How To Do Everything,One of my favorites,5,This podcast is so delightful. Ian and Mike are so likable and funny. It‚Äôs great to listen with kids. And I learned a lot of tricks. It‚Äôs worth listening to them all.
952,How To Do Everything,Kristy,5,I love the show!!! Every episode was so funny and short & sweet!! Please bring back the show!!!
953,How To Do Everything,I miss this show so much,5,"Mike and Ian, come back!"
954,How To Do Everything,Love this show!,5,What a breath of fresh air. Please consider putting additional shows on the air.
955,How To Do Everything,How to Nothing,2,"I listened to three podcasts and gave each 3 stars, a very average podcast. A content example... a kid calls in and wants to name his stuffed toy after Peter Sagal the horrible comedian and he says yes. Unsubscribing."
956,How To Do Everything,I‚ÄôM TOO LATE!,5,I just found this podcast!!! And now it‚Äôs gone ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ This show desperately needs to be revived!
957,How To Do Everything,Good,4,Reasonable advice but random topics
958,How To Do Everything,Please come back,5,"I love this podcast so, I wish it would return! I listen to the old episodes all the time."
959,Science Vs,There are some decent podcasts.....and then there‚Äôs Science vs,5,One of the most informative and entertaining podcasts out there. I thoroughly enjoy every episode and cannot wait to hear what‚Äôs next.
960,Science Vs,The worst distracting music,1,Plz change some other type of music when u introduce the topic.
961,Science Vs,Please give new content besides COVID-19,1,Would love for the podcast to go back to other science topics besides the trend it has gone in the last few weeks of sticking to all COVID-19 related topics. The world is inundated enough with COVID-19 and even a middle of the road consumer of news and reports can discern what he or she needs to know about COVID-19. I don‚Äôt need another podcast to reiterate the saturation that‚Äôs already broadcasted.
962,Science Vs,Just the best,5,"This is my favorite podcast... Such a perfect blend of hard science and goofy puns. I've been listening for a while, but finally posted a review because your coronavirus season is the best thing in my world right now. Thank you Wendy and team!!"
963,Science Vs,There‚Äôs more to science than coronavirus,3,"I enjoy this podcast and appreciate the well-researched episodes, but (shockingly) there is more going on than just coronavirus. I‚Äôm hoping this season isn‚Äôt exclusively coronavirus content. A couple minutes of NCVC at the end of each episode isn‚Äôt enough. This is Science Vs. not just ‚ÄúScience Vs. Coronavirus.‚Äù"
964,Science Vs,"Great, but especially now!",5,"Thanks Wendy for your informative, entertaining podcast! It‚Äôs fun to listen to, like I‚Äôm with a friend. Great content and well done."
965,Science Vs,Wendy is an Icon,5,I started listening during Christmas 2019 and heard the pandemic episode -LISTEN TO THAT ONE IF NONE OTHERS. But Wendy has such a sweet and energetic voice that makes even the bad information easy to hear. I love their integrity and honesty when conveying the science.
966,Science Vs,The Podcast We Need Right Now,5,I‚Äôve been listening for a few years. There has only been one episode I didn‚Äôt enjoy at the time - a fictional episode in which they imagine a global pandemic. It‚Äôs like they knew. They always do a nice job of explaining things at a level that people with a middle school-level understanding of science can handle.
967,Science Vs,Actually 6 stars,5,Hi Wendy! Love your podcast!
968,Science Vs,Always a relevant topic,5,There‚Äôs rarely an episode that doesn‚Äôt address something I‚Äôve recently been thinking about. I love this podcast and the host. Very engaging
969,Science Vs,Look forward to each episode,5,"Facts and a bit of humor. To the whiners: If you want more, go read the references they provide in the show notes."
970,Science Vs,"Oh yea, SCIENCE...amuse me!",5,"So relevant. So fun. So scientific and legit. This an educational podcast that knows I need to be entertained, too! The topics are current and if new data ever contradicts something they‚Äôve previously recorded, they will tell you that! And another refreshing bit of honesty and transparency‚ÄîI can check out ALL of their sources from each episode. I can see where they got their data, and come up with my own conclusion if I want.
I‚Äôm especially thankful to have Science Vs, a resource I trust, during this pandemic. It‚Äôs still scary, but hearing the facts from Wendy and crew makes it all feel less alarming. Thanks for keeping it real and honest."
971,Science Vs,"Well Researched, Delightfully Delivered",5,"I‚Äôve appreciated the amount of thought and research into each topic since the first episode, but am so very grateful for the bi-weekly COVID-19 updates that have evolved with the crisis - asking the questions and providing detailed information that has been hard to find and trust from other media outlets. I love to listen to Wendy‚Äôs reporting. The education has been a salve for my quarantine anxiety."
972,Science Vs,Hoped it would be better.,1,Thoroughly disappointed
973,Science Vs,You should be ashamed of yourselves,1,"During a national health crisis, for you to compare a legal, pre-approved and tested drug that may have a positive impact when used under a doctors supervision to that of someone eating fish tank cleaner that happens to share one of the ingredients is despicable. You portray your show as being ‚Äúfact based‚Äù. The fact is, you are just playing the same media bias game that the rest of the mainstream media is. Aren't you tired of being wrong, over and over?"
974,Science Vs,Great show,5,"Really appreciate the sound research they are doing, summarized into concise, easy to understand episodes. Science can be nuanced and hard to understand, but that is precisely why now, more than ever, we need people to understand the science and use it to base their decisions!"
975,Science Vs,Almost perfect,5,"Love this podcast however I don‚Äôt appreciate the cliff-hanger in the last episode in these uncertain times it felt unnecessary
Had to still give 5 cuz I really appreciate this show"
976,Science Vs,Science YAY,5,Keep doing what you do! I love all your episodes because I can get a lot of information. I love that I can also fact check by looking up the citations
977,Science Vs,Cry For Help,5,"Would Science Versus please do some non covid-19 podcasts? Maybe for every 2-3 covid-19 podcast, you do one podcast about literally anything else. I understand covid-19 is the hot topic and a serious pandemic, but I think a podcast about something other than covid-19 would be great. Thank you very much, I absolutely love the podcast."
978,Science Vs,Love it,5,Interesting yet humorous. Love Wendy.
979,Science Vs,Biased and political,1,Used to love this podcast but unsubscribed due to the inability to critically evaluate without showing bias. Also promotes left ideology to the extreme which is nauseating.
980,Science Vs,Real science,5,"This is one of my favorite podcasts! Please go back to making eps that aren‚Äôt about Coronavirus though, my life needs more normalcy/less corona inundation"
981,Science Vs,Scary!!!‚Äôn,2,"I‚Äôm to scared by this please stop with the scary episodes
üôèüò¨üò≠ü§Øüò≥ü•∂ü•∫üëéüëçü§úüé∫"
982,Science Vs,Eh,1,Science is the fad cult of the moment. Lets see where it lands its followers in 10 years let alone 1000.
983,Science Vs,Stop with the politics.,3,Stories have some decent content but allusions to political sides is nauseating. Document. No sides. You‚Äôre losing me..
984,Science Vs,Stop pushing left political ideology,1,There has been around 6 to 7 episodes within the last year and a half that work more as a one sided political opinion column rather than based out of actual science and research. I like to learn and come here for the actual research and interesting facts. I am bombarde with politics already everywhere else. Please stop so I can enjoy the podcast again. This podcast used to be good! If u don‚Äôt believe look at the other one star reviews. We are noticing Wendy.
985,Science Vs,Fun and educational turned into hearsay!!!,1,"The show used to show not always unbiased evidence but was documented, fun and laying out the questions that need answers!
Since Covid19, where is the research ? One doctor‚Äôs opinion is becoming the truth.
The episode on masks and protection is just so weak in presenting the real questions at hand. This is going along the general US opinion instead of really searching for evidence.
This show used to be great when it was really able to say ‚Äúwe do not know!‚Äù"
986,Science Vs,Amazing!!!!!!,5,Anything else is a lie
987,Science Vs,Uplifting even when dire,5,"Maybe it‚Äôs the accent, but Wendy‚Äôs presentation style helps breakdown the wall of panic and gets the information in! And lots of episodes are actually fun."
988,Science Vs,Pandemic episode on point!,5,"Been listening for awhile and been catching up on episodes and just listened to the Pandemic episode on 3.25.2020 and holy moly did you ever get it right?! Keep fighting the good (science) fight! I‚Äôm gonna keep listening and spreading the word, not germs. üò∑"
989,Astronomy Cast,Astronomy made fun,5,As a casual astronomy fan Astronomy Cast has great discussions that keep you interested. Great for experts and casuals like me.
990,Astronomy Cast,Good content. Terrible audio,3,"Good content for the average listener, but they really need to even out their volumes."
991,Astronomy Cast,Where has this podcast been all my life??,5,Thank you for your dedication!
992,Astronomy Cast,I love this cast,5,Keep doing what your doing this is awesome I love it!
993,Astronomy Cast,Best Astronomy podcast!,5,Fraser and Pamela create one of my favorite podcasts. Be sure to check out the ‚Äòraw‚Äô versions of each show on their website. They include behind-the-scenes banter and listener questions not included in the official releases.
994,Astronomy Cast,Best show for astronomy!,5,"Could you please do a podcast on quark stars? Also the differences between neutron stars, quark stars, and strange stars? Are strangelets a real thing or just a ‚Äúquark‚Äù of the math?"
995,Astronomy Cast,Pure joy,5,This is one of my favorite podcasts! Can‚Äôt get enough! Go science!
996,Astronomy Cast,Astronomy Cast is Excellent.,5,"Remarkable how Dr. Gay is able to explain even subtle aspects fo physics and astronomy in a clear and understandable way even without video. Most similar information services are video only. I greatly appreciate being able to learn from this podcast without sitting down to watch.
Update 2019. Still true. I listen all the time. Even back episodes are useful. I just joined patreon to support the show."
997,Astronomy Cast,Best science pod cast out there,5,"started listening in high school.... continue 10 years later
love it love it love it"
998,Astronomy Cast,Interesting,5,"I love how I can listen to this and learn fun astronomy facts and news at the same time. This podcast has increased my knowledge, intriguing to listen to, and have me new ideas for observatories to visit."
999,Astronomy Cast,Informative!,5,Frasier and Pamela do a great job making astronomy and space science understandable and interesting.
1000,Astronomy Cast,Amazing!! My favorite.,5,"I‚Äôve been listening for past couple years, but when they started doing their update episodes, I finally took note of all their older episodes, which are great! I went back and started from ep. 1 and am working my way through. I credit this podcast with getting me re-engaged with my love for science."
1001,Astronomy Cast,Great,5,Very happy with this. I have been listening from the beginning.
1002,Astronomy Cast,This show rocks,5,Love it! This show inspired me to get a telescope and get in to astrophotography Keep killing it.
1003,Astronomy Cast,Grrreat,5,So very informative.
1004,Astronomy Cast,My Mum counts this as school,5,Me mum counts this as school it‚Äôs so good
1005,Astronomy Cast,Good info,3,...but I have unsubscribed. I can‚Äôt bear another minute of the cutesy interplay between the hosts and I‚Äôll scream if I hear them mispronounce Charon one more time.
1006,Astronomy Cast,Perfect for Backyard Astronomers!,5,"This podcast is the perfect springboard for backyard astronomers. There is enough detail in each episode to give you a good understanding of the topic, and it fuels your curiosity to dig deeper in the topics that interest you. Frasier and Pamela are such kind and fun tour guides to the cosmos. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough!"
1007,Astronomy Cast,Dumbed-Down Astronomy,2,"While I love Dr Pamela‚Äôs beautiful speaking voice, and Fraser Crain‚Äôs quirky style, this is Dumbed-Down Astronomy at best. They go too far in trying to make the science palatable and drop a great deal of real content in the process."
1008,Astronomy Cast,The smugness is overflowing,2,"I listen to this podcast only for comedic value. I‚Äôm sure the hosts have good intentions, but I laugh at how self important and smug these people sound as they explain their interpretation of life. It‚Äôs only worth two stars."
1009,Astronomy Cast,Little astronomy,5,I listen to the show yesterday and I had very little astronomy and it was talking about science-fiction and Stargate SG one I‚Äôm rambling on nothing about astronomy come on if you‚Äôre going to call yourself an astronomy podcast stay focused on astronomy please
1010,Astronomy Cast,Fall Into Space!,5,The most likable people in the universe tell you the latest in the universe... what‚Äôs not to like?!
1011,Astronomy Cast,AverageJoe,5,"My favorite podcast right now. Great chemistry between the hosts. The topics, and Dr. Gay is incredibly knowledgeable and articulate in covering each one."
1012,Astronomy Cast,Long intro,4,It takes 5-6 minutes of talking to actually get to the podcast. And the co host is extremely redundant. Fraser: good radio voice and easy to understand. Co host: can‚Äôt keep a consistent distant from microphone and whispers half of her phrases. If I turn up the volume to listen to her extremely dynamic tonalities I get blown out when ever Fraser talks.
1013,Astronomy Cast,Excellent topics covered well,5,"Good overviews of interesting and timely astronomy topics.
Occasionally I hear few errors on items that are a bit outside their areas of expertise but in general it is on point."
1014,Astronomy Cast,Great Show...Far Too Much Time On Commercials,1,This was such a great show but as time went on I learned far more about Caspar mattresses than about astronomy each episode. Shame really.
1015,Astronomy Cast,Awesome Show,5,"Really really great show! They talk thoroughly and interestingly about science, physics, and astronomy. A great way to learn more about the world around us.
**ONE RECOMMENDATION** it would be so awesome if you guys could organize the podcasts by season! I am powering through all the episodes from the beginning, and it stinks to have to scroll all the way to the bottom of a 500 episode long list."
1016,Astronomy Cast,Best Podcast,5,I adore this podcast. I listened to it when I took an astronomy class and it helped me SO much. I love listening to it now because it helps me remember all the cool and freaky stuff about space.
1017,Astronomy Cast,Outstanding podcast,5,"I really enjoy listening to this podcast. I am trying to catch up to current releases as I am still a few years behind. The hosts have great voices and wonderful chemistry, they cover a huge range of topics that relate, sometimes tangentially, to astronomy."
1018,Astronomy Cast,100% Awesomeness,5,Great content on the latest astonomical science and space missions and entertaining dialogue from both hosts. I love this show!
1019,Skeptoid,"Really good, really bad",3,"This podcast is hit or miss. On basic subjects, it is great. If he is advocating for one of his sacred cows he does not use reason or proper skeptical techniques. The Soros, electric car, and wind farm episodes were particularly terrible. Be skeptical. Especially of this podcast."
1020,Skeptoid,How can you NOT like this????,5,"Clarity, professionalism and straightforward. Best education I will ever get outside of hanging with Stephen Hawking for a decade (he was notoriously slow to speak), and unlike the beloved Hawking... this podcast gets the message out fast. My weekly addiction!"
1021,Skeptoid,Skeptoid,5,"This is an amazing compendium of rational thinking applied to the vast fields of pseudoscience, folklore, and alien visitation to name just a few topics Brian Dunning and his supporters have cast their skeptical eye at. The show notes provide in-depth sources."
1022,Skeptoid,0 stars He‚Äôs desperately grasping at straws the entire episode. It was bad..,1,"This douche of a narrator is grasping a straws constantly. I much prefer academia over alternative researchers and I‚Äôm no conspiracy theorist but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt be on to something with the sphinx. Nothing you said proved the older sphinx theory to be impossible yet you kept reiterating that bc you said so its bs I‚Äôm not even a huge fan but to call true researchers like graham Hancock a
‚Äú ancient aliens pseudo scientist‚Äù because he might have appeared on a few episodes is so trashy and wrong and has nothing to do with the topic at least he‚Äôs open to being wrong unlike tons of mainstream academics that when pressed immediately begin throwing insults and tantrums. This guys methods are just as bad as the claims he makes about the covered alternative researchers. This episode was cherry picked and lacked huge amounts of information to say case closed its debunked. For me I don‚Äôt know its still up In the air, but they way this guy lead this narrative intentionally trying to make people like Dr. shock and the others appear as complete quacks purposely instead of using that time to show more evidence for the topic is absolutely unethical and intellectually dishonest.. 0 stars not worth the lies that come with the listen."
1023,Skeptoid,Smug and terrible at sourcing,2,"This smug presenter, as a skeptic myself, gives us a bad name. He literally quotes ‚Äúdebunking evidence‚Äù from a lot of texts and sources that are lacking in veracity to begin with. Then he uses circular evidencing with past episodes, as if that last episode was based on quality research.
This is what‚Äôs wrong with people who THINK theyre smarter than everyone else, they can‚Äôt see that their own work is faulty! Where are your primary sources?! And no, researches you agree with are not primary sources.
Again, sometimes the points made are valid and are interesting, but the smugness derived from his actual LACK of knowledge overshadows a small technicality that he think proves his point.
This is armchair-professionals at its finest. Do you understand, Mr narrator, that you can‚Äôt believe everything your read online?!
The world needs less stupid people that think they know everything."
1024,Skeptoid,The Best; Hands Down,5,"This podcast should be weekly listening for grade schoolers (and adults). I have a post-graduate degree in Physics and Electrical Engineering and I absolutely love this pod cast.
I frequently tell my wife how hard it is for someone who knows everything to live with someone who only thinks she knows everything, but Skeptoid.com keeps my eyes opened wide!
Skeptoid.com is informative, interesting, and entertaining. I would absolutely recommend it to EVERYONE who is not a well-educated super-genius like me (and make your children listen).
I heartedly recommend subscribing and becoming a sustaining member, donating a regular amount each month to keep these good ideas in our world.
The world desperately needs more Brian Dunning!"
1025,Skeptoid,Now Frequently Just An Advert For Other Podcasts,1,"This show was fantastic, but Dunning has lately used several of its entries solely to advertise other podcasts and paid products. Listen to the back catalogue, but don‚Äôt subscribe."
1026,Skeptoid,Great podcast; great information.,5,"This podcast has been instrumental in helping me see errors in logic and to identify times when I had been relying on misinformation to inform my world view. Back in 2013-14, when I first discovered Skeptoid, I binge-listened to every single episode. I agree that the musical episodes celebrating podcast milestones are my least favorite. To each his own. I‚Äôm glad that I found this valuable information."
1027,Skeptoid,Cranky skepticism is good,5,"Thanks for letting me know that I am not only cranky skeptic! Love the way you present your reasoning. I don‚Äôt always agree, but I defer to your superior fact checking! Keep it up!"
1028,Skeptoid,"Long time listener, first time caller",4,"Skeptoid is a great resource for all the reasons others have listed. My only complaint is the musical episodes. They‚Äôre awful. I appreciate all the research Mr. Dunning and his team put into each episode, but really, the musicals are bad."
1029,Skeptoid,Brian doing great things.,5,"Frankly, after reading some of the strange one star reviews of this podcast from even ten years ago, i just wanted to leave a note about brian‚Äôs potential political orientation. i don‚Äôt think he expresses opinions in his podcast which really warrant associating him with one political party or view or the other. The guy just does facts, and seeks the truth, and if this makes him ‚Äúlibertarian‚Äù or whatever, (like this would be a bad thing) well maybe the accuser needs to reevaluate where he stands with his own biases and how it is that, when finding the truth, and when uncovering and examining certain social or politically charged notions or stories we like to think of as plainly and self evidently true, perhaps one is led to more libertarian-oriented ideas?
Libertarianism has a tradition of applying axiomatic truth finding (praxiology) to the social sciences and political theory. it leaves the ‚Äúmust feel good‚Äù out of politics and tries to discover ‚Äúwhat is good‚Äù for human society.
So....... maybe?"
1030,Skeptoid,Good Stuff! The one star reviews are cheap shots,5,"An objective podcast with accessible links to check sources; Usually interesting, and informative topics.
Some of the negative reviews mention a political agenda. This is a simply a non-political show. Some of the topics viewed through a scientific or skeptical lens may be in agreement with an ideology. However, the podcast is only promoting a way to look at quality evidence and draw the most reasonable conclusion as a result of that evidence.
Dunning bends over backwards to clarify his conclusions and the reasoning for drawing them. THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT OF THE PODCAST.
Best yet, like a true freethinker, he self corrects, accepts valid criticism, and takes pride in doing so...........you know kind of like how science works........
-Totally Gnar Gnar"
1031,Skeptoid,Most fascinating podcast,5,I have listened to every episode of the Skeptoid podcast and love them all. So educational as well as entertaining. Really teaches me how to evaluate new claims that I hear from gullible friends.
1032,Skeptoid,Tired of being wrong,5,"You should listen to these then. There's a podcast for pretty much everything, and if you listen to them all, you should start finding some patterns. Everything is laid out quickly and efficiently too, so you don't have to spend too much time with a bunch of unhelpful stuff."
1033,Skeptoid,Best place for the evidence based view of pop culture topics,5,"Skeptoid was my entryway to logical, skeptical thinking on topics I had questioned for years. The format is focused and the episodes are just the right length to get in depth analysis, without getting into the weeds. This is the place to start for anyone interested in learning how to critically assess the information we are bombarded with every day."
1034,Skeptoid,Objective?,3,Find it quite a coincidence that episode number 666 is the one on Jesus. Feel there is a lean to every episode just like everyone else.
1035,Skeptoid,Skeptoid is Awesome!,5,I recently found Skeptoid and I love it! The deadpan delivery and willingness to accept criticism is just fun to listen to and it‚Äôs very informative. Brian‚Äôs rational and scientific approach is refreshing and he debunks irrational thought without being condescending. I love it!
1036,Skeptoid,"Typically effective, but frustrated by recent episode",3,"I generally like this podcast and find the information useful and well researched. Sadly, the recent episode on wind energy and birds was disingenuous and incomplete. There was no mention of how wind farms affect bats, which in the world of bat conservation, is a very hot topic. Bats are often unfairly maligned in our society, and glossing over the negative impact wind farms have on their populations is gross and misleading."
1037,Skeptoid,5 stars,5,If you don‚Äôt believe in climate change eat my *ss
1038,Skeptoid,My Go-To,5,"Skeptoid podcast and Skeptoid Media as a whole is my absolute ‚Äôgo-to‚Äô for all topics, things, curiosities, etc. that have given me pause as to their validity and the explanation of how the said subject has crept into my consciousness.
Their rigor in adhering to the scientific method and dedication in allowing only the most tested and factual studies and understandings of all things to make it to me and my listening/reading is appreciated more than words in a review can express."
1039,Skeptoid,A Weekly Dose of Skepticism,5,"What‚Äôs that? You‚Äôve happened across ‚ÄúAdam Ruins Everything‚Äù but you want more of science and skeptical views of topics ranging from urban legends and conspiracy theories to aliens and monsters? Look no further! With 700 episodes in the bank, you‚Äôll find plenty here to pique your curiosity and then relieve it. The host, Brian Dunning, even has all his references for each episode on his website. Hmmm... sounds familiar. Although you won‚Äôt find the overt humor of Adam, Brian takes you through topics and turns his skeptical eye on them taking you on a 10-15 minute journey every week on a new topic."
1040,Skeptoid,Elliptical Orbit,1,"Do your research. There is no man made Global Warming. Google Elliptical Orbit And NASA. No need for any taxes. Particularly for BS carbon taxes. Stick to something you understand, Like UFOs and big Foot. Socialism does not work."
1041,Skeptoid,Happy Birthday Skeptoid!,5,I cannot count how many times I've sent people links to Skpetoid episodes to educate them on whatever scam/BS/misinformation they believe. This podcast has been an invaluable resource for 13 years so far. Thanks Brian!
1042,Skeptoid,Always thought provoking.,5,Learn something new every time I listen. Love the science and comprehensive reporting on interesting topics.
1043,Skeptoid,Awesome podcast,5,"Been a listener for years and still look forward to each weekly addition. Covering a wide range of topics, each podcast provides a condensed deep dive into the background of each subject along with informative skeptical (sourced) analysis. Great for anyone interested in critical thinking.
Enjoy."
1044,Skeptoid,Conspiracies declassified.,1,"I bought your book conspiracies declassified hoping to shed light on government coverups. But all you did was try to validate them. Best example, JFK. You write in ‚Äútruth‚Äù ...‚ÄùAll AVAILABLE evidence shows that JFK was assassinated by a lone gun-man whose psychological profile matches very closely with similar killers today. No evidence suggests otherwise. .... coming from a guy who says all jfk conspiracy theories contradict one another isn‚Äôt your statement funny? ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE..... NO EVIDENCE. HOW CAN YOU SAY THERE IS NO EVIDENCE SUGGESTING OTHER WISE WHEN YOU CLEARLY KNOW THAT there is thousands of documents that would suggest other wise. Not to mention I certainly hope that was written before you saw the zapruder film which clearly shows his head going back, and to the left. Not to mention it would have been impossibly for Oswald to fire the first shot when the warren report said it was fired due to the blocking of the tree below where the gun was found. So I just wanted to say you don‚Äôt believe conspiracies or that our corrupt government has done the shadiest crap on earth because you probably work for the government. I hope anyone who ever listens to you knows that you‚Äôre an idiot based solely on that book you wrote. I actually burned it after I read how the only ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù you acknowledged to be ‚Äúsomewhat true‚Äù are things the government had no way of hiding. You clearly are as blind and deaf as Helen Keller."
1045,Skeptoid,Everyone needs this- especially if you do not think that you do,5,The world needs more clearly argued and dispassionate skepticism. Mine is too often confrontational and emotionally charged. Brian reminds me of the value of calm rational thought!
1046,Skeptoid,Who Holds Back The Electric Car,1,"Just listened to the electric car episode, cancelled subscription. Brian makes a weak argument from analogy, ignores the important question of tradeoffs, and goes pie in the sky in terms of best case scenario payoffs. Really disappointed."
1047,Skeptoid,Hellll yea,5,Hell yeah
1048,Skeptoid,Skeptoid,5,"I¬¥ve been listening this podcast from its very begining, It delivers what it promises. They take a subject from the supernatural world and demostrates with facts, logic and evidence and proves it wrong. The best thing is that is not a hour and a half long, so you can listen to it from begining to end just having lunch."
1049,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Exactly what I need,5,Finally an amazing way to deliver information and unite science all around the universe
1050,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Why can‚Äôt I keep listening in the background and do other things on my phone?!,1,"I love these talks, but there isn‚Äôt that much going on in the videos and I like to listen to them in the background while I look at other things on my screen while I commute- why can‚Äôt I do both? I listen to other podcasts more because I am able to do both. There should be an option to disable the video and just listen to the audio!"
1051,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Wow!,5,"Brilliant! I loved this so much it inspires me soo much, thank you for making this podcast"
1052,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Nevermind...,5,Who is this Ted guy? He sure talks a lot! And why does he cast pods all over the place? Is he like Johnny Appleseed or something? Maybe like Hal... trying to open pod doors?
1053,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,A+,5,I look forward to listening to these Ted talks.
1054,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Radar for ice,5,Cool
1055,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Really great podcast,5,great ideas
1056,TEDTalks Science and Medicine,Stroke of Insight-Jill Bolte Taylor is must see!!!!!!!!!!,5,"One of the best presentations I have ever seen! She's magnetic, hypnotizing, and invigorating!!! Her experience is absolutely remarkable! She's an amazing woman!!! And scientist !!!!"
1057,Point of Inquiry,Uneven,3,"Sometimes the episodes are terrific, other times it sounds like there's a kind of underlying ""party line"" here that promotes big pharma and big agriculture. Their defense of genetic engineering is just off. GMOs are problematic because we don't know how they will interact with other organisms and the environment over the long term, and we've already seen some big problems with Monsanto seeds, for instance. Why muck around with the ecosystem? We've already done enough damage, haven't we?"
1058,Point of Inquiry,Blind to reality,1,Science like it was 1600. Diet Coke is food and GMO are great science? No thanks I‚Äôll stay organic. You keep drinking Roundup if you think organic is a fad.
1059,Point of Inquiry,Great,5,"Thoughtful and interesting conversations, thank you"
1060,Point of Inquiry,Meh,1,Meh
1061,Point of Inquiry,Great Podcast!,5,A great podcast attempting to create honest discussions for a more rational society. I only wish I discovered it earlier......
1062,Point of Inquiry,Been listening for years,5,Great interviews with people I've never heard of. Several of these interviews led me to purchase the interviews book.
1063,Point of Inquiry,Thought provoking,5,Always interesting guests and topics.
1064,Point of Inquiry,Thought Provoking,4,Always something interesting on tap.
1065,Point of Inquiry,Weak,1,Still subscribing but weak as of late.
1066,Point of Inquiry,I look forward to each new episode,5,Refreshing and enjoyable content
1067,Point of Inquiry,Excellent podcas but Need Indre Viskontas more,5,"One of the few podcasts I listen to regularly without getting bored. I wish Indre Viskontas could host more of them, she does such a great job!"
1068,Point of Inquiry,Awesome,5,Awesome...
1069,Point of Inquiry,Sound quality is just too poor,3,"Interesting conversations, but the sound recording quality is so bad I just had to give up on it .. too much echo, background noise, lack of level control .. is everyone using a speakerphone or something?? frustrating .."
1070,Point of Inquiry,Great podcast that took a nosedive,2,"POI has long been one of my favorite podcasts. When DJ Grothe left, they lost a good host and replaced him with multiple hosts that did a very good job themselves (eventually settling on just two), though one of the prior hosts is a much better writer and interviewee than interviewer. Recently, both hosts left the organization, and they were replaced with two new hosts, and the result has been profoundly disappointing. One of he hosts proudly identifies himself as being from HuffPost Live. HuffPost is one of the leading sources of pseudoscientific nonsense on the Internet, and a prominent skeptic organization has teamed up with them? WHY? The other new host seems nice, but she's a very poor interviewer, not only asking uninteresting questions (relying in the interviewee to carry the show entirely), but reading them in the stilted voice of an elementary school student reading a book report. The technical quality of the podcast has also taken a nosedive. Sometimes, the interviewer will be cloud and clear in both ears, whereas the interviewee will only be mapped to one speaker, and often at a totally different volume level. For an interview podcast which uses no stereo effects, it should probably be encoded in mono, thereby avoiding these amateurish mistakes."
1071,Point of Inquiry,love it.,5,Solid. Thanks for doing this show.
1072,Point of Inquiry,Two things this podcast is (or at least the host),1,Arrogant and prideful.
1073,Point of Inquiry,Use to be great.,2,"This used to be one of my favorite podcast. Unfortunatly I have given up on it due to very poor audio, and the female host's voice. I find her accent extreamly annoying."
1074,Point of Inquiry,Highly Recommended for New Perspectives,5,"I don‚Äôt always agree with the perspective given, but always finish episodes with a greater understanding of the topic."
1075,Point of Inquiry,Interesting but poorly executed,2,"This podcast really suffers from poor audio, which by today's standards is unacceptable. It makes it unconfortable to hear. The topics are provocative and keep me invested. I will try it for a while longer just because of that, but if audio does not improve I will have to unsubscribe."
1076,Point of Inquiry,Top Notch Effort!,5,Very informative and interesting podcast. The only thing that ever holds back an episode is a guest a bit on the boring side. But no one said every expert has to be interesting. And the few 4 star episodes are offset by the many 5 star podcasts.
1077,Point of Inquiry,Amazing relevant topics,5,Discussed by adults. It's not as dry as NPR can be at times yet it's not loaded with annoying banter that you hear on other current event podcasts. This podcast is like Stuff that will blow your mind and Inquiring Minds not Cognitive dissonance or atheists on air (which are great but not safe around kids).
1078,Point of Inquiry,I miss the old host DJ,2,Point of Inquiry used to be one of my favorite podcasts three years ago. Sorry listening to it again in the last two months and I have been disappointed every time. I had to unsubscribe from the podcast after listening to the episode about elevator-gate where the host used words like 'vicious' and 'horrific' to describe whatever happened to Rebecca Watson in the elevator at a conference. I'm not exactly sure what happened but I'm confident that it wasn't horrific or vicious because those words have a connotation way more severe than whatever happened in that elevator. I come to a podcast about reason to escape from weasel words like that and people putting editorial spins on every single topic. I miss DJ and the era of reason.
1079,Point of Inquiry,A faint shadow of its former self,1,"This podcast used to be among my favorites. My original review from 2011 was 5 out of 5! After several staff changes and a new partnership with the Huffington Post, the intellectual content dropped dramatically. I finally had to unsubscribe when discredited journalists like Johann Hari are now considered suitable guests."
1080,Point of Inquiry,Always thought provoking,4,"Always a pleasure to listen to well reasoned discussion on life, philosophy, morals, and laws. A must listen."
1081,Point of Inquiry,"Well,",1,Neo liberal trash.
1082,Point of Inquiry,Welcome to the 19th century...,4,"At its best, Point of Inquiry offers solid discussion of important intellectual topics and, in relation to most podcasts, at a fairly high level of discourse. Some of the interviews have been particularly engaging, offering meaningful insight into topics.
But not all interviews are equal.
Perhaps one of the most frequent problems I have with the show is its ongoing ideological prejudice qua scientific progress. Though the podcasters may think of themselves as progressive and on the intellectual forefront, much of their paradigm is borrowed from 19th century attitudes towards religion. It's as if they read Max Weber and then stopped engaging in the continuing dialogue regarding religion in the public sphere.
This is an important point to make, as political progressivism should not be seen as synonymous with their particular brand of the ""science vs. religion"" dichotomy. Indeed, as intellectuals such as Horkheimer and Adorno have shown, belief in scientific progress may instead be seen as the antithesis of political progress.
In the most recent decade, intellectuals like Charles Taylor, Jurgen Habermas, and Robert Bellah have put forward incredible and articulate views regarding secularization, modernity, and religion in the public sphere. Compared to them, the Dawkins-variety engagement with these issues is sophmoric."
1083,Point of Inquiry,Excellent,5,"Intriguing guests, interesting perspectives. I began listening to this podcast years ago, and it remains one of my favorites."
1084,Point of Inquiry,Great show but the file is WAY too big,1,"I‚Äôve enjoyed this podcast but often can‚Äôt fit it on my little iPod because it‚Äôs encoded at an insanely large 320 bits making it up to five times larger then most other podcasts and it generally doesn't sound very good. But, they don‚Äôt seem to care. So, I‚Äôve stopped subscribing to this podcast, as It takes up too much space."
1085,Point of Inquiry,"Excellent interviews, but often distracting audio issues",5,"This is an excellent podcast with interesting and varied subjects, good interviewing technique, and smart. You will be a better person for listening.
BUT you can hear the interviewers (Josh Zepps and Lindsay Beyerstein alternatively) making noise during the time when the interviewee is speaking. I hear them doing things like ‚Ä¶ opening a door, jotting notes on paper. There have been times when I‚Äôve been so completely distracted wondering ‚Ä¶ what is that sound? Are they solving a Rubik‚Äôs Cube?
It is always quiet when the interviewer is speaking, but as soon as the interviewee begins to speak, the distracting noises commence! Crazy-making!"
1086,Point of Inquiry,Excellent,4,"Whether it's Josh or Lindsay, this is a consistently excellent podcast."
1087,Science Magazine Podcast,Great podcast!,5,Super informative!
1088,Science Magazine Podcast,Such a wide variety of topics.,5,It‚Äôs very interesting.
1089,Science Magazine Podcast,Solid Science News,5,"Can be a teeny bit dull at times but very useful, informative and reliably intelligent. Info is made accessible to a wide audience."
1090,Science Magazine Podcast,Wow podcast!,5,I am glad I get to listen to the science podcast as I get to work. Quick way to catchup on the latest. Love it!!
1091,Science Magazine Podcast,Diverse and Intellectual Stimulation!,5,"Bottom Line: Highly recommend for anyone who is curious about world around them! From reports on beehive viruses to racial biases in algorithms, to observing cancer cells in dogs from antiquity, this is a very informative podcast! Easy to listen to, and you don‚Äôt have to be a scientist or STEM person to love!!! Recommended to me by a friend with PhD in organic chemistry!"
1092,Science Magazine Podcast,Aspirin,4,"I hope they take time to talk about the data for aspirin and wether it really helps
Or hurts populations where it is used prophylactially in assymptomatic people despite being sponsors by Bauer aspirin !!!!!"
1093,Science Magazine Podcast,AAASFan,3,Science podcast used to be great but it has really slipped.
1094,Science Magazine Podcast,Good,5,I like how you will tell a lot about the topic and details instead of skipping over them. It allows me to have a much better understanding of the topic.
1095,Science Magazine Podcast,Milquetoast Science,3,"I want to like this podcast but it has all the personality of a beige wall, slowly drying. It‚Äôs not as if they don‚Äôt choose subjects that should be interesting, there‚Äôs plenty of potential, but it‚Äôs just not showing through. Where is your passion for your subject? Are you reading the questions and answers from auto cue? And what‚Äôs with that crap segue music? Yawn."
1096,Science Magazine Podcast,Poor,2,"Pleb access, dull. Not useful."
1097,Science Magazine Podcast,"One star for audio, five for content",1,"This is the most frustrating podcast in the world. I love the content, but the audio becomes impossible to hear in every single episode. I can't tell you how much content I miss because I have to shut it off halfway through every week. Why do they insist on interviewing people over the phone? Sometimes even their own employees are interviewed over the phone. Please please please make an effort to interview people with better microphones, over Skype, Google Hangouts‚Äîanything would be better. This audio quality is less than unacceptable‚Äîit's unlistenable. They have professional-grade content and programming; but the audio is amateur."
1098,Science Magazine Podcast,A decent podcast,4,"The delivery isn't perfect but it isn't bad either, I didn't notice it until I read these other peoples' reviews. A podcast worth getting."
1099,Science Magazine Podcast,"Pays no mind to the phrase, ""Make science fun"".",3,"This podcast presents interesting topics and information in maybe the most boring format imaginable. The conversation between host and guest sounds like computer voices in a QA QA... format. The hosts' response to answers is typically, ""interesting"" then next question.
They could definitely benefit from a producer with experience at startalk radio, stuff you should know, radiolab or similar shows.
With a quick glance at the reviews I can see I'm not the only one that feels this way. Hopefully they take these reviews into consideration and change the format in the future because it has all the content in the world and tons of potential, it just needs a better show format."
1100,Science Magazine Podcast,Love listening every week,5,"The stories are usually pretty intriguing, and leaves me filled in on the latest science news. Sarah Crespi keeps it entertaining and funny as well!"
1101,Science Magazine Podcast,"No, women do not get paid 77c on the dollar for ""the same work""",5,"That figure has been debunked a thousand times. Even when you control for full-time workers, women still work fewer hours (due to the definition of full-time being 35 hours), and tend to work in different professions. Accounting for all of these sorts of factors, there's still something around a 4 - 6 cent deficit unexplained, but is certainly not 77% for the ""same work"". 77%: true. Same work: false.

Still 5 stars because I love the show, but that love is conditional on the continued impression that the show is unpolluted with political rhetoric. I just hate to hate to hear false information repeated by smart people, especially in the name of science."
1102,Science Magazine Podcast,I wish I could recommend it,2,"I read the journal. It's excellent. But it's painful to listen to to editors read scripts in an excruciatingly awkward fashion. I suppose they are trying to dumb down the content but that is not why I listen, I want to hear the undiluted content. I'd recommend the producers listen to the nature podcast, and take notes."
1103,Science Magazine Podcast,Interesting!,5,"I love this podcast because you guys, along with ""Nature"" help me stay updated on new and interesting information!"
1104,Science Magazine Podcast,Great variety,5,"I love the variety of topics and listen to this podcast in my lab. I love this podcast as there isn't much annoying distracting sounds. The science is good, relevant, and the hosts get to the point. Hosts also seem interested in their topics whereas the guys from Nature seem bored half the time."
1105,Science Magazine Podcast,Keeps Me Current,5,Full of interesting information.
1106,Science Magazine Podcast,"Good information, wide array of topics",4,"This is a good podcast. It's a good overview of science topics. . The podcast also gives a rundown of articles in the current issue of Science Magazine. I'd love to hear a little more detail about those articles. While others have commented on how dry the delivery can be, my only issue is more the audio quality of some of the interviews."
1107,Science Magazine Podcast,Get Your Science Here!,5,I listen to a large and growing number of science podcasts and this is definitely one of the good ones. I feel I'm getting a great dose of important science news from a variety of people each week.
1108,Science Magazine Podcast,Great show but it's TOO LARGE!,2,"This deserves to be better.
Why is this podcast 320bps? 64 would work just fine. Does anyone there understand the science of audio production?"
1109,Science Magazine Podcast,Sooo much fun,5,Thank you for the brain material
1110,Science Magazine Podcast,great program,5,I love the interviewers excellent questions and the interviewees well researched answers.
1111,Science Magazine Podcast,Excellent,5,"By far my favorite science podcast and I listen to a lot of them. Love the host--she asks smart and intriguing questions and the content is always delightfully varied so you get an excellent snapshot of what's going on across various disciplines.
Keep up the great work!"
1112,Science Magazine Podcast,Downloading problems,2,"Having problems subscribing, i click on the link but nothing happens??"
1113,Science Magazine Podcast,The Best,5,Sarah is amazing. Love this podcast
1114,Science Magazine Podcast,Informative but...,2,"I find approximately 1 in 3 pieces very informative and fascinating. However, Science has succumbed to political correctness, putting a progressive spin on many stories by injecting opinions on top of the facts. Unfortunate."
1115,Science Magazine Podcast,Weekly update,4,"It's great to find these well-produced podcasts that recap the last week of interesting science news. Casual, friendly delivery makes it accessible to non-scientists."
1116,Science Magazine Podcast,Eh,2,"I liked the former format with a few quick hits on science topics of general interest followed by a more in-depth look at one or two other topics.
In addition to a less engaging format, the podcast also now often deals more with the process of scientific discovery than the discoveries.
It is just less interesting."
1117,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Fun and informative,5,Short videos explaining in an interesting and fun way. The occasional cartoon to help visualize things that my children can visualize and understand. Facts explained in a very good way for understanding to anyone whom is even slightly interested.
1118,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Unavailable,1,"Claims the podcast is unavailable or currently ""hidden"""
1119,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Great short videos,5,Great short videos
1120,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,what a great podcast. please make more.,5,I really miss these podcasts. They were insightful and funny. Please bring them back.
1121,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Very informative,5,Beautiful HD pics! And very good information!
1122,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,must have!,5,I'm watching the 2nd episode and must say: very informative and absolutely beautiful especially on retina display devices!
1123,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,good,3,"My ipod is ipod nano2,it's very old ipod,but it just can read it.This web is in china,it's not fast to free it.I have a ipad too,a iphone and aipod touch„ÄÅnano4 mini touch,thanks to apple,I like it very much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1124,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Does not work,1,I tried to download it on my 3G iPhone and got a message that it won't work on this device. Boo hiss
1125,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,I know things happen but....,3,"It should be able to play on all iPods.
You would gain nothing but more listeners/viewers if you kept your formats current. We the veiwers and you the podcasters would benefit greatly. I'm giving 3* only cause it looks great on my CPU."
1126,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Dissapointed,1,How come there's no iPod touch support here? I have the 4th gen and it can't play this =\
1127,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,YOU CAN PUT THIS ON YOUR IPOD/IPHONE,5,"Once the podcast is fully downloaded, you click on it once, then go to the menu on the top of the screen and click on the button that says advanced, then click on convert to iPod/iPhone. It takes a long time to download each one, but believe me, it's worth it!"
1128,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,The One Star Isn't Because This Podcast Is Bad,1,"Quite the contrary actually. This is an excellent podcast. The reason I am giving this a single star is because it will not play on my brand new 80gb iPod Classic. It states that, upon trying to sync the podcasts, that it is not compatible with the iPod. The single star is towards Apple for not letting these excellent podcasts work on brand new iPod Classic's. Shame on you Apple. I would have loved to enjoy this on the go. Besides it not working, this is a 5 STAR PODCAST! Please Apple, fix this problem."
1129,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Amazing Podcast,5,"The images are spectacular.
What I find most amazing though, is how many people buy new technology and don't accept the responsibility of learning how to use it.
These Podcasts look great on my G5, Video iPod and my iTouch."
1130,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Stunningly beautiful and delightfully informative,5,I get excited when the latest one is done downloading. Breathtaking images + great music + thought-provoking information = my favorite podcast ever. I strongly recommend that you subscribe.
1131,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,A must have,5,"One of the best HD podcast - a must have for all s-f (and not only) fans :)
Jeden z nalejpszych podcast√≥w HD. Polecam wszystkim mi≈Ço≈õnikom s-f i nie tylko :)"
1132,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,There is an iPod version!,5,"There is another version that's 640x480 that plays fine on iPods! Use the ""Search iTunes Store"" box to find plain old ""Hidden Universe,"" NOT ""Hidden Universe HD."" It's better quality than trying to downconvert this HD version using Quicktime, like some people have recommended. Plus, it's more convenient since NASA already did it for you! :)"
1133,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Hidden Universe HD from NASA,4,"Other than being too short I found these videos to be quite informative and incredibly fascinating. The Stars, The Universe and even our own Solar System is in a word, AMAZING.
Imagine what we could do if we spent all the money we spent on war and wasted energy on exploring the heavens... think of all the advancements in science and medicine and technology
who knows we might actually wipe out war, hunger and disease in a single lifetime."
1134,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,?,5,Why wont it let me subscribe to them : (
1135,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Great except for...,4,"Dr. Robert Dorkus Supreme! This guy needs to stick to astronomy, not hosting podcasts. Love all the pictures and info given in this podcast though!"
1136,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,There's another version for iPods! This one is for the full HD experience.,5,"Note that this is the HD version of the podcast. There is another one that is at standard resolution and works on iPods; just search for ""Hidden Universe"" and look for the one without ""HD"" in the title!"
1137,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Great for everyone,5,"Very good quality podcast. Great photos and good descriptions of those photos. It really makes you think about what is really in our sky. Unless your computer can't handle HD programs, this is a great podcast for all ages. Very good job."
1138,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,hi,5,i know alot of peole have been having problems with playing it on their ipod but i'm just saying that i have the 3gen nano and i havnt had any problems
1139,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Gorgeous!,5,This podcast takes my breath away every time I watch it! Keep it up!
1140,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,this is so cool!,5,"absolutly outstanding use of u.s. tax dollars creating something awsome :)
keep up the good work nasa!"
1141,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,What a podcast should be,5,"Excellent production. Very educational. It's not overly sensational or amateur like so many podcasts in the wide world of podcasts. This podcast shows that science is cool enough without the sensationalism. Thanks a lot, guys!!! BIG thumbs up!"
1142,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,"Still can't watch on my Ipod touch, nice!",1,"Still can't watch on my Ipod touch, nice!"
1143,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,No good,1,Can not watch on my iPod touch. No support.
1144,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,"Great, beautiful podcast",5,"Very entertaining and informative podcast, but the images it provides are the real stand out. Excellent job."
1145,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,Please change file format!,2,I would like to watch on my iPod touch
1146,Hidden Universe HD: NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,"Interesting, enlightening and in beaitful HD !",5,I'm a science buff since childhood. I've seen most of the Hubblecast podcasts available on iTunes and I'm impressed.
1147,Hubblecast HD,Too bad,2,The images would be stunning if you could see them. The dialogue and associated graphics don‚Äôt ever allow even one second of clear view of what would be stunning photos. Best I can say is find the photos here and look at them somewhere else.
1148,Hubblecast HD,great astronomy podcast,5,wonderful images
1149,Hubblecast HD,Dr Whozi doesn‚Äôt understand vision,5,"When viewed at a normal distance of about 1.5 times the diagonal of the image (TV or photograph) the limit of human vision is the 720 spec. So don‚Äôt get hung up on numbers, just enjoy the show."
1150,Hubblecast HD,Fantastic‚Ä¶but can you make it ApTV compatible for the HD version?,4,"Love the HC, but would love it even more to view it on our beautiful LED TV. Unfortunately, it will not sync with our ApTV. Can you change the format in a manner that preserves it's beauty but also enables great devices like the ApTV to play the file?
Also, have you considered a 3D version of HC? That would be great for the kids!"
1151,Hubblecast HD,Cool show,4,"Anything astronomy is great with me. I really don't care about your reproductive habits, stick to the stars when your recording the show."
1152,Hubblecast HD,Excellent work!,5,"I am a new fan of astronomy and luckily for me I found this podcast, great quality, excellent images and very good production! Thank you Dr. J, excellent work!"
1153,Hubblecast HD,Annoying,1,"The images are fantastic! The problem is they don't show nearly enough for the time and space they take up. These are large files; but they have far fewer images then other sites because of the way the site it put together.
First problem is they have almost a full minute of introduction of the topic and credits for the site. And sadly they have almost a minute of credits at the end. So right off the top you've wasted 2 minutes on everyone of their podcast seeing essentially the same thing. Then for some reason on video podcast of a space telescope a significant period of time is devoted to looking a host (Dr. J) in the face. I'm not sure why they thing we want to spend about half the time that left after the opening and closing credits staring at an Englishmen while he talks. When what we want to see is the cosmos.
This won't bother you the first time. But wait until you watched five or ten of these and you realize how much time is wasted and see how you feel. There are much better sites. Like the Chandra site.
Sorry Dr. J, I for one do appreciate your need for attention. But, congrats on the birth of your child."
1154,Hubblecast HD,Excellent!,5,"Being a new fan of astronomy, I recently found this podcast.
I am still catching up, just viewed ""Healing Hubble"".
Dr. J - thanks for presenting such amazing information to us!
Please keep them coming!"
1155,Hubblecast HD,Great podcast!,5,"I'm not an astronomy nut but am able to follow the podcast and find it thoroughly entertaining. It's like a weekly briefing. Plus, the host is great!"
1156,Hubblecast HD,Does not work??,1,Wrong movie format for device??? These are podcasts for iphone/pad??? Right???? Should this not play on my phone?
1157,Hubblecast HD,Th Best,5,"The Best PodCast Out.
P.S. It Will Not Go On My IPod Video???????????????????????????????????????????"
1158,Hubblecast HD,Beautiful,5,This thing rocks.
1159,Hubblecast HD,Brief and interesting,5,"This is a great podcast for those interested in astronomy. It's not long at all, has great graphics, it's interesting and it doesn't take 30 minutes to get to a point. I highly recommend it. For the podcast that aren't posted in iTunes, you can go to the website and download them in different formats and sizes. Enjoy!"
1160,Hubblecast HD,hubblecast hd,1,"I have latest 10.4.10, and latest iTunes. Using a Mac Pro quad desktop. I do not have Apple TV, because the Apple TV spec is 720p rather than 1080i or p.
The video does not play on my computer, but instead flickers. Similar result for Washington Post HD podcast. I know they are free, but these don't have to be worthless."
1161,Hubblecast HD,Can't play on apple tv anyway,3,I'm not sure about Dr's experience but I can't get this to sync to my apple tv(1.1) anyway..can't wait to see it. won't play on my old windows computer and too slow to convert to ipod
1162,Hubblecast HD,Blame the Europeans,3,"Drew7t has a point. I doubt that Apple is encouraging (let alone bribing) the ESA to make viewing podcasts inconvenient to its customers, and even if they were I doubt that the European Space Agency would accept any bribes. Apple doesn't care anything about the podcasts they list except that they'll be popular and are appropiate for most ages, so they aren't going to do anything about changing the format. Someone explain to the producers that a a couple thousand people converting is, in fact, MORE than one Hubblecast team member doing it instead."
1163,Hubblecast HD,simply great!,5,i'm loving these hubblecast episodes. definitely a must see for those who are interested in space/astronomy. looks amazing in HD too!
1164,Hubblecast HD,Breathtaking!,5,"I subscribed to the HD version by mistake. I watch it on my little iMac, and I am completely blown away by both the spectacular computer animation (which IMO is better than most feature films) and the beautiful photographs. Short but filled with good information. A great show for kids and adults and those with lots of astronomical knowledge or very little."
1165,Hubblecast HD,Won't download on an 2008 IPod classic,2,"**For some reason the podcast will not download to an IPod????? Does anyone know why? So it is hard to review a podcast I cannot watch. If it is only for Apple TV, they should let you know."
1166,Hubblecast HD,great stuff,5,"This series is perfection: Informative, entertaining, current; and in the end leaving you craving for more. I only wish there were more of these. What a great concept."
1167,Hubblecast HD,"An excellent science show, beautiful to watch",4,"As podcasts go this is very well produced, it stacks up against any major TV series documentaries in production values. I am not a professional astronomer, more an avid fan of the science so my remarks would be: greater science depth and more frequent episodes, which is a compliment. On a decent Cinema Display with a good video card they are gorgeous to watch.
Comments on Commentators:
LLK and No TV, Only iPod...
You cannot play HD format podcasts on many iPods. I own a a newer iPod Nano which plays video beautifully but not HD.
Dr Richard...
You mention the versions of software you have but what kind of video card you have or display, that has a great deal more to do with your ability to play any video successfully.
Phil Gaskill
Why is it necessary to refer to the narrator as a 'bimbo' ? Is this more to your own personal self loathing than women?"
1168,Hubblecast HD,Phenomenal - Exceptional,5,"This is just a spectacular podcast!!! Educational, beautiful, well-done etc... -Just amazing! Can't say enough good about it. Our family watches them repeatedly. I have an old pc - almost 5 years old running xp and I have no problem viewing it. Won't run on my iPod video either, but I don't care. And - our own president can't say nuclear properly - ugh - you're handed galexies on a platter and are nit-picking about idiotic trivialities."
1169,Hubblecast HD,"Fun, free series",4,"My son, age 7, loves this podcast and I love the price. However, can someone explain to me the difference between the Hubblecast, hubblecast hd, and hubblecast full hd versions? Thanks"
1170,Hubblecast HD,Not Happy,1,"I downloaded 6 Hubblecast episodes to put on my Touch iPod only to find out that they couldn't be installed on ""my"" iPod. Very disappointed"
1171,Hubblecast HD,"GREAT looking podcast, but it won't load on iPhone",3,"This is a wonderful podcast, the HD quality is amazing on the computer screen. Unfortunately, I was hoping that I could watch this on my iPhone 3G S. It displays an error that this podcast is not designed for this device. I still loved watching it on my iTunes displayed on a 24"" LCD screen. Let me take it mobile............ :-)"
1172,Hubblecast HD,FUN!,5,It is very educational and also very fun
1173,Hubblecast HD,doesnt work,4,it doesnt go on my nano
1174,Hubblecast HD,Whine about the whine,2,I love it when someone's (Drewt7) review is nothing but some guy / gsl whining about someone else's whining. Wait! Now I'm whining about someone's whining about someone's whining..
1175,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Lottery numbers and banana skins,4,"I head a fully incorrect statement regarding carbon content it takes to raise cattle. 80 head of cattle can be raised by two people and 6 horses on land not suitable for crops.
I know this because my grandfather did it. Natural grasses from peatland was used for the winter feed, harvested with horse drawn equipment means no tillage and this is done in a region with only a fraction of a centimetre of topsoil. Summer grazing of natural growing grass is used. The local wildlife in competition with cattle are bears as they also eat clover and a few other plants but eat the odd calf so that may be fair and with mull-deer but the deer also consume shrubs that cattle don‚Äôt eat.
However this was an era of 2.some billion roughly. Problem is factory farming today. Meat protein is undervalued monetarily because it‚Äôs over produced to feed 7.6 billion hungry people. If my grandfather was to produce the same amount of nutrients and calories with plants the deforestation would be massive and the carbon content would be massive as well. If a person wants to lesson their carbon footprint, don‚Äôt have children it‚Äôs the top of the list of what‚Äôs in your control and have 100% success.
Animal protein can be a carbon fixing process but not on the volume currently being used. Today‚Äôs practices have become the problem and today‚Äôs overpopulation of humanoids is the problem. The deforestation required to produce plant matter insect free to feed 7.6 billion people is still the problem no matter how it‚Äôs sliced. Shipping and concentrating essential nutrients for proper health with a vegan or vegetarian diet is just as problematic due to the growing population. We have become an unsustainable population for our current strategies."
1176,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Setting the standard,5,"The Naked Scientists podcast team has been sharing approachable and relatable science topics with the world for over a decade! They have truly set the bar for science podcasts. Each episode has a theme (even if that them is Q&A) but they always cover other timely or interesting tidbits. This means each episode has many different facets and is worth listening to, even if the major topic is not your cuppa tea. I started listening a couple of years ago, starting with episodes from about five years back. Great road trip podcast; listen when cleaning the house, waiting for an appointment, on a plane or completing some other mundane task on which you do not need to concentrate."
1177,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Quality is consistently great,5,"One of two podcasts where I always know the content will be great. But then it's not fair, because people with British accents always sound smarter. The length (a bit under 60 minutes) is just right for me. Analysis is objective and the right depth. It's great."
1178,The Naked Scientists Podcast,12 years and counting,5,"It's been 12 years that I've been listening to this podcast, so I suppose I should write a review. This was one of the first podcasts I subscribed to in 2006. I always come out feeling like I learned something, which is more than what I can say for most podcasts I listen to."
1179,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Informative and entertaining!,5,"For many people today, science has become chic - but for many people, modern advances in various scientific fields is not something everyone can easily grasp while reading journals or peer research. Enter the Naked Scientists.
Each episode features the panel of experts who break down the latest news, trends and theories, as well as provides answers for listener-submitted questions ... all presented in plain English for the regular folk to understand. And it‚Äôs all presented with a lighthearted sense of humor and wit. And for some of us outside of the UK, listening to people with British accents tends to have a calming effect, I‚Äôm guilty of it."
1180,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Does what it says on the tin,5,Nudity+Science
1181,The Naked Scientists Podcast,So informative,5,I've been listening to this podcast for a year now and just got around to reviewing it. It is my go to podcast when I feel like learning something new. This guy knows so much. W
1182,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Love this podcast,5,Learning so much science on this podcast. Very engaging and educational!
1183,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Highly recommend to both scientists and non scientists!,5,I'm a chemistry PhD graduate stufent and I'm thoroughly impressed by the balance between telling a scientific story accurately through the eyes of researchers and making sure the story is relatively staightforward to understant!
1184,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Best Science in Cyberspace,5,Love the way you make Science accessible to the general public! I'm a faithful subscriber. Keep up the good work!
1185,The Naked Scientists Podcast,The Best!,5,I cannot say enough good things about this podcast! I'm hooked. Listen and you will be hooked too!!!
1186,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Frank,4,I enjoy the current science news and the kitchen science
1187,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Great show,5,Great show for science lovers.
1188,The Naked Scientists Podcast,FANTASTIC!!!,5,"I've been listening to these podcasts for years, usually while I am hiking. Each one is informative and fascinating. What a wonderful way to inform the non-scientist about the phenomenal discoveries all around us. I love each of your host's unassuming manner, wit, and intellect. Usually when I return from my daily hike, I have been so absorbed, that I don't even realize I was exercising. Lots of times I wish I could recall everything discussed, but that is not possible. However, when a related conversation comes up with family or friends, I find that it all comes back to me. Thanks so much for helping me to be more informed. This is far and away my favorite podcast."
1189,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Love It!!!!,5,During the school year I do a lot of traveling. This is one of the handful of podcasts I LOVE listening to as I drive back and forth to school. Thanks SO much for making these available!!!
1190,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Science is fun!,5,"Want proof?
Listen to this podcast."
1191,The Naked Scientists Podcast,I miss Naked Archaeology but this fills the void.,5,"And then there was ONE. . .
This appears to be the last Naked [fill in the Science] podcast. That's a shame. everyone one of them strove to bring you up[ to date discoveries and thoughtful recent commentary.
But the most generic is by no means the least. They cover everything from Antarctic drilling, to archaeology, to behavioral science, to population studies, to genetic research and more beyond. Worth a serious listen."
1192,The Naked Scientists Podcast,great,5,love these podcasts!!!
1193,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Amazing,5,"Love the accents! Wonderful show, I need to go back to the beginning and start listening from then."
1194,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Nicely balanced and comprehensive,5,"I like the scope and quality of this program. It provides for user input, covers basic and advanced topics and helpful advice. Dr Chris Smith does other programs, too, and I'd listen to anything he works on. Thanks to him as well as everyone who works on this show."
1195,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Outstanding Science Reporting,5,"Dr. Chris Smith and the other Naked Scientists give me my weekly dose of science in fields that I don't follow. The story/science selection is very good and the show's staff are excellent reporters. The way they report on the stories keeps the show from getting dry, without trying to be funny."
1196,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Essential listening,5,"No other podcast that I‚Äôve found covers the full breadth of science news, along with in-depth conversations about the latest discoveries. I have friends who are actual scientists, and I am often more informed than they are about what‚Äôs going on in the science world thanks to Dr. Smith and the Naked Scientists team.
I especially love the contributions of all of the female scientists on the show. Dr. Helen Scales is always a delight to listen to. Her passion for her field and joy of talking about science comes through in every episode she is a part of."
1197,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Awesome podcast,5,Informative
1198,The Naked Scientists Podcast,My Favorite Science Podcast,5,Just what I was looking for - thank you!
1199,The Naked Scientists Podcast,"Love the podcast, lots of cool info!",5,I love the podcast as it has lots of very interesting stories that I wouldn't normally get. I used to only listen to Science Friday but now its good to have more sources of science in my life! Makes me sound super smart in conversations :)
1200,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Great Science podcast,5,funny and informative..
1201,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Bad,1,Jock science
1202,The Naked Scientists Podcast,Kid AND adult friendly,5,"I love that kids are so involved in this show, and it is presented at a level that adults can appreciate without a bunch of kid ""antics""..."
1203,The Naked Scientists Podcast,good show,5,"Like the show, good stuff."
1204,The Naked Scientists Podcast,"Fun, informative and accessible",5,"Great podcast about science news, with a great cast of presenters and show variety (news, questions from listeners, news from science fairs, etc). The refinements to the show-new music, etc are great. I always long for the next episode. Good web site, too. Thanks guys!"
1205,You Are Not So Smart,One of my absolute favorite podcasts,5,"I‚Äôve been listening forever. As an armchair psychologist, I love the insight provided by various experts on this podcast. One of my most highly recommended podcasts."
1206,You Are Not So Smart,Bad audio,2,"Was eager to listen. But the audio was wacked. Bothersome pronunciation maybe even. Either way, had to turn off pretty quickly to save my ears"
1207,You Are Not So Smart,Hah,4,All the subjects I used to argue online in philosophical debates in the late 90s and early 00s re: epistemology and ontology now backed up by studies and data. 4 stars just for the belated confirmation bias. üòÜ
1208,You Are Not So Smart,Even the intro is dope,5,"Okay, does anyone else love how hard that into slaps?
In all seriousness though, this podcast is so interesting. So many thought provoking ideas and thoughts. I can listen to this while I sit outside and it really gets me thinking about my life in this universe. Quickly became one of my go-to‚Äôs."
1209,You Are Not So Smart,Great in-depth interviews and discussions,5,"David does a great job (IMHO) finding interesting people to talk to about decision-making, opinions and beliefs, cognitive biases and more. The episodes really get into the topics and give me lots to think about. This is in my top-5 podcasts to listen to."
1210,You Are Not So Smart,Blown away,5,"Perhaps the title set my expectations low, but so far the first 10 or so episodes I've listened to have been fantastic. The episode on A/B testing is my favorite so far--some incredible revelations for me in that one. I love science, so I feel right at home with this show."
1211,You Are Not So Smart,Exploration of why we behave the way we do,4,But things got weird with the crickets LOL
1212,You Are Not So Smart,Just opportunity to bash trump,1,Political podcast and desperate attempt to be clever. Not a big fan of either side of politics but I do appreciate when people have integrity and come out and say that they are politically bias.
1213,You Are Not So Smart,Is it over?,5,"No need to rebroadcast old shows. That‚Äôs a waste and false hope this podcast is ever going to put out new material. Man up and call it. If it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over. No Shame. Decent back episodes."
1214,You Are Not So Smart,MUST LISTEN TO,5,This is one of my very few Must Have podcasts.
1215,You Are Not So Smart,Awesome podcast!,5,Great information with interesting interviews and discussion.
1216,You Are Not So Smart,Hooked from the beginning,5,"I was a fan early on and finally leaving a long overdue review. I‚Äôve easily taken more notes from this podcast than any other. There is always something interesting to learn that will make you question everything! There are some truly thoughtful and deep discussions with many of the guests, and the show is just as much a celebration of science as it is of self-delusion (i mean this as a complement)."
1217,You Are Not So Smart,I love this,5,Brilliant. Thank you.
1218,You Are Not So Smart,Learning!,5,"I‚Äôve learned a ton from this podcast, and now am more aware of my own thoughts and actions and more understanding and sympathetic of why people do the things they do"
1219,You Are Not So Smart,Don‚Äôt push your politics on me,1,"This podcast has potential, but the host instead uses it as a personal podium to force his political opinions on the listeners. If I wanted to hear that crap I would seek out a political podcast. This was supposed to be, and still claims to be, a podcast about the human mind and its frailties. A place to learn, not a place to be condescended to from someone‚Äôs imaginary moral high ground."
1220,You Are Not So Smart,"Great, great interviewer!",5,"David‚Äôs talent is bar none! He is super prepared, follows conversation incredibly, asks excellent questions, and finds awesomely interesting topics!!!"
1221,You Are Not So Smart,Eating on podcast is weird.,4,"I would give this 5 stars, but eating the cookies is weird imho."
1222,You Are Not So Smart,?,3,Why can‚Äôt I subscribe to this?
1223,You Are Not So Smart,Smart,4,"A great podcast for understanding people, and yourself, better. Some of the production isn't great (it's a one-man effort), but the content is always worthwhile. Definitely check it out."
1224,You Are Not So Smart,Smart,5,Informative & interesting. I skip the cookie reviews at the end though.
1225,You Are Not So Smart,Excellent,5,This podcast is most excellent.
1226,You Are Not So Smart,Literally EVERYONE should listen,5,"Start with #121!
None of us truly understand... ourselves! Let alone why others believe/behave a certain way. This information needs to be taught far and wide if humans are to ever survive and work together effectively.
After #121, listen to them all. Every episode isn‚Äôt a golden nugget of insight, but they are all worth your time. I‚Äôve become a ‚Äòpaid subscriber‚Äô, I only wish he could produce episodes more often! Also, he models his production after proven formats which make them easy to listen to."
1227,You Are Not So Smart,Always Mentally Stimulating,5,"Usually I listen to podcasts in my car, or while walking or running. This one I listen to at my desk, so I can jot down notes. I‚Äôve learned so much, and some of the episodes have even caused me to change my behavior or attitudes."
1228,You Are Not So Smart,Psychology for Dummies,5,This podcast is very very informative and will make you a better person by challenging how you think about things.
1229,You Are Not So Smart,Great podcast,5,Awesome podcast for building your critical thinking toolbox
1230,You Are Not So Smart,Amazingly informative and well recorded!,5,"I just listened to the episode ‚ÄòEvil‚Äô and although I‚Äôve studied the topics discussed in this episode for a long time I still learned a lot of new and interesting details. The interviewer was very collected and led the discussion to all the right places; I was incredibly impressed by the pace and volume of topics covered (although I‚Äôm a junkie and I would have been even happier with a three hr episode on the subject- so I guess I should just buy the book).
If I were to make a slight criticism, it would be only that the interviewer was a bit too passive, and perhaps it would make for more entertaining listening if he‚Äôd engaged personally a bit more. I‚Äôm really happy with this find however and I‚Äôm excited to hear more!"
1231,You Are Not So Smart,Great podcast,5,"Very interesting episodes. I struggle with the host's accent ( Tin when he means ten, frin when he means friend etc.), and the phone interviews more often than not are of poor sound quality."
1232,You Are Not So Smart,Mind blown - every week,5,If you want to understand both how amazing your brain is - and how it‚Äôs messing with you - this science-based and absolutely entertaining podcast is a great place to be. Especially appreciate the introduction to so much great research and so many smart people.
1233,You Are Not So Smart,This One,5,"Maybe not everyone‚Äôs cup o‚Äô tea‚Äîbut it should be. Oolong or green, I promise you‚Äôll find a taste you‚Äôll enjoy herein.
It‚Äôs good to the last drop. And, that is not apt to my allegory."
1234,You Are Not So Smart,Invigorating!,5,"New subscriber! The conversations are so illuminating. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by my own weird mind, and my funny (wildly inaccurate) way of explaining dysfunctional behaviors or relationships. It‚Äôs nice to have a place to laugh about it all. :) Thank you, David!"
1235,Discovery,Highlighting Scientists works,5,I love that your using time to highlight scientists their jobs and have to talk on their point view. Keep them coming.
1236,Discovery,Love,5,"Love the Fly Gal, learned so much from it."
1237,Discovery,Great Stuff,5,"Easy to listen to, informative, not so stiff, fun yet serious."
1238,Discovery,Not dumbed down or boring,5,‚ÄúSense of time‚Äù is a good episode to start with.
1239,Discovery,Consumers are not solely to blame for plastic issues,4,"Overall, I am enjoying this podcast and really appreciate the episode exploring the history of plastic and how and why it became so widely used. It‚Äôs so much more interesting and useful than simply hearing for the millionth time how evil plastics are. However, the conclusion of the episode on plastic recycling had an overly simplistic viewpoint offered that it‚Äôs the job of the consumer to make sure that companies do a better job of recycling more and manufacturing less. Way to let government and corporations off the hook! There was also no argument made against Unilever‚Äôs standpoint that they won‚Äôt simplify their packaging because they believe in ‚Äúconsumer choice‚Äù. Again - blaming bad environmental practices on the individual."
1240,Discovery,Excellent,5,Excellent as always
1241,Discovery,It could be Emma Thompson,5,"I think Dr. Fry could possibly be Emma Thompson: smart, funny, irresistibly eloquent. She and Dr. Rutherford have such excellent banter, I often listen to subjects in which I have absolutely no interest.
This is excellent-"
1242,Discovery,The Elements Series -- Yesss !!,5,"Great podcast, this one always in my feed. The episodes about individual elements are terrific, always a surprise discovery, an unexpected angle. And of course...more Rutherford and Fry please. Many thanks and keep up the good work - lots of us are listening."
1243,Discovery,Great science podcast,5,"This is a very well-produced podcast, covering a wide range of science topics. Excellent writing and production quality. Highly recommend it!"
1244,Discovery,A little of everything,5,"I love science related podcasts and so many great ones come from the BBC and this one has introduced me to a few that I missed.
Covering a wide variety of subject and always thought provoking it's always a half hour well spent."
1245,Discovery,Amphibians are cool!,5,I recently listened to the podcast on amphibian decline and it was really good; very thought-provoking and informative on this important issue.
1246,Discovery,Episode 1,3,"Episode 1 is missing from the iTunes, so you've got to download it fm the website. not cool."
1247,Discovery,Like it a lot,5,"Historical and educational
Awesome."
1248,Discovery,Great stuff,5,"My only problem with this podcast is that it isn't daily. Other than that, it's great! =)"
1249,Discovery,Awesome!,5,It's educational and addictive. Keep up the good work.
1250,Discovery,Freaking AWESOME,5,"So defiantly worth my time listening! I look forward to more, brain candy!"
1251,Discovery,Good Content!,5,A welcome addition to my other science podcasts.
1252,Discovery,Exciting and up to date,5,This series keeps me educated in a fun way. Knowledge is power!
1253,Discovery,Wow,5,Just heard the mercury episode on radio and immediately had to search what program this was. So incredibly well made.
1254,Discovery,Awesome,5,Very good
1255,Discovery,Thanks for never deleting episodes,5,You like living? THERE'S A TOPIC FOR ANYTHING! TWO WORDS: WHALE MENOPAUSE!
1256,Discovery,This show is all over the board,5,"It goes to a ton of different place, but it's usually pretty good."
1257,Discovery,Really great podcast,5,"I love the narration, story line and the delivery. It is not trying to be a mini TV program, which I like."
1258,Discovery,Annoying commentary,1,Try to be objective with your opinions. It was annoying to hear that same man talk over the woman over and over. You all can do better.
1259,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Love it,5,Keep us the good work
1260,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Hmm,2,This show would be way better without the laugh track.
1261,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Love the theme. Hate eu praise!,4,"Stumbled upon this feature on my iPad mini after hearing Parker Posey would be in new podcast mini series. Very first podcast I subscribed and listened to, ‚ÄúBrits in space‚Äù was sullied with e.u. praise. As a American that has awoken to the reality of Multinational entities that own over 90 percent of all media we absorb have no interest in the advancement of society through healthy competition. But would rather subdue the masses rendering them voiceless and without opinions so they can carry on pilfering all they lay claim to."
1262,The Infinite Monkey Cage,So good,5,"Great experts, great comedians, priceless comedy, thought provoking reflections."
1263,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Really going downhill...,2,"This show is turning into a really ego trip for the presenters. Too much time given to their self-regarding comments and virtue-signalling. What was enjoyable about this originally (and made it connect with people so well) was its accessibility and that it just did science.
Now its vanity and wokeness...please don't keep doing this"
1264,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Great Podcast!,5,"The best science podcast. Would appreciate a return to more physics and mathematics though...last few seasons have not had much. Really like guests Fay Dauker (sic) and Jeff Forshaw. Also like comedian Andy Hamilton, and Ross Noble is outrageous. But my favorite is the somewhat serious Brian Cox and appreciate his efforts to keep Robin and the panel on topic. Wish this podcast were on more frequently. Have listened to past episodes several times already."
1265,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Your lack of understanding of chemistry is cute!,5,"I‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt appreciate the fundamental particles, oh sorry...the tiny particle de jour, but being able to create unique reactions sort of makes chemists, well...like the Greek gods. In fact, if you look closely at Botticelli‚Äôs Birth of Venus, you‚Äôll notice she is wearing goggles as she steps off the half shell! But keep going...it‚Äôs by far the best podcast available!,"
1266,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Great show,5,I love your show and I think you should call it the infinite (in all directions) monkey cage. Just to stop the criticism of the title
1267,The Infinite Monkey Cage,British humour & irreverence at its best,5,"Once again the BBC outdoes itself with a witty and educational creation which does not talk down to its audience. The quality of guests from Fry, (Picard) Stewart to Dawkins is unsurpassed."
1268,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Amazing way to educate and grow,5,"I love this podcast and the amazing intelligent people that have such brilliant minds. I‚Äôm only a 22 year old in Arizona in the states but I have this desire to know why for everything in the world. I suppose my inner philosophy to question everything and this podcast is a great way to learn a perspective from every part of our humanity. I love the episode of the future of our humanity and if I could recommend anyone to bring on your panel please bring Yuval Noah Harari. 3 amazing books (Sapians, homo deos, 21 questions for the 21st century) I think he would bring an incredible conversation to your show! Thank you for educating me at such a young age. I can‚Äôt afford education in the states and this is definitely a great way to self educate myself."
1269,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Fun and Informative!,5,The Infinite Monkey Cage is a fun way to learn new things and hear different perspectives on scientific issues- everything is presented in an interesting way which is accesible even to the layman. Definitely worth listening to!
1270,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Absolutely addictive.,5,"I could listen to these podcasts all day, every day."
1271,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Truly great podcast,5,One of the smartest and most interesting podcasts ever. Great hosts and wonderful array of guests getting in depth on some of the most pressing topics of the day. One not to be missed!
1272,The Infinite Monkey Cage,brain food with a side of humour,5,"Will listen to this podcast over anything else as it reminds me that the little petty s&@‚Äú is just that. An S, an ampersand, an at and a quotation."
1273,The Infinite Monkey Cage,The absolute best,5,"My favorite podcast, Brian and Robin are brilliant, making science accessible and fun while keeping its integrity"
1274,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Excellent,5,"I can barely believe this podcast exists‚Äîit‚Äôs that excellent.
I feel grateful to the creators and to the Universe at large that I and others are able to have the experience of connecting with great minds via this podcast."
1275,The Infinite Monkey Cage,I love it,5,It‚Äôs so interesting and I eagerly await each episode that gets released
1276,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Essential Programming,5,Brilliant ‚Äî Well done. The BBC is second to none.
1277,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Great content but poor production,4,It‚Äôs hard to listen to. I highly recommend a new audio engineer.
1278,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Hilarious,5,"The scientific content of this show is interesting as it is, but Robin Ince and Brian Cox‚Äôs dry, comedic chemistry is what keeps me wishing there was always more to listen to. This pod cast is by far the first one I catch up on when new episodes come out. Highly recommend."
1279,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Thought provoking and hilarious,5,"The format works surprisingly well: usually there are two or three actual scientists and two or three non-scientists who just happen to be comedians or other celebrities. Each week a particular scientific topic is discussed. Well, that's what's supposed to happen. Usually it all falls apart and hilarity ensues."
1280,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Does a podcast get any better?,5,I don‚Äôt think so!!!!!! Love the hilarity and intelligence pouring from this podcast!!!!!! Best pod ever!!!!
1281,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Scientainment,5,When Science and entertainment are your thing. The BBC delivers with what we really need. Facts and funny.
1282,The Infinite Monkey Cage,So much fun!,5,"The podcast puts you next to some of the smartest people taking about the current and relevant subjects of science and tech.
What more could you want? Never miss an episode."
1283,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Want more,5,Can‚Äôt get enough of this podcast. Wish it went year round.
1284,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Incredibly entertaining and informative,5,"One of my favorite podcasts. I've learned so much from it, while enjoying every bit."
1285,The Infinite Monkey Cage,"Absolutely the top score, using the Kelvin scale",5,Love the physics and your staff‚Äôs chemistry.
1286,The Infinite Monkey Cage,... at a loss for words.,5,"Well, maybe not entirely.
I love your show. The strange thing is that even when some subjects go completely over my head, I can‚Äôt help but keep on listening.
You have a great format.
PS: when will you be back?
Thanks,
Dan"
1287,The Infinite Monkey Cage,Smart and Funny,5,This podcast is a great mixture of comedy and science. Brian and Robin have great chemistry making for a delightful show.
1288,The Infinite Monkey Cage,"The Brits Do It (Best), Again",5,"Why is this THE best science-related podcast on this planet? Because of British people's apparent love and respect for knowledge and humor, in this case represented by Brian Cox and Robin Ince. Alas, in the USA, many of our citizens not only tolerate ignorance and stupidity, but seemingly celebrate them. This podcast is definitely an antidote to both."
1289,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,My first podcast,5,My first podcast when I my first iPod with the mechanical spiny dial. Loved listening to them.
1290,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,A longtime favorite,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to the show almost since the beginning, early on in 2006 catching up with the back episodes from 2005. As hosts of the very first skeptical podcast, Derek and Swoopy always had something worth hearing about and interesting to learn from for skeptical n00bs like me. Recently, I‚Äôve been re-listening from the very first episodes to the very last up until 2018. With scads of good interviews, terrific book references, and cool skeptical online tools, some still extant, I give the show five stars and four thumbs up ‚Äî well, were I a bonobo!"
1291,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Bad news,1,This podcast doesn‚Äôt know the difference between natural medicine that ha been in use for successfully and for profit scams. My Naturopath is board certified M.D. from Columbia university. My acupuncturist graduated from Harvard. This podcast is crap.
1292,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Declining quality,2,"I once looked forward to this podcast as a well-edited compilation of diverse voices from the scientific and skeptic community. These days, quality and diversity seem lacking. A recent May 2017 episode had a seemingly unedited 30+ minute discussion of Wikipedia editing. Some of the sound quality of the contributors is also quite grating."
1293,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Good podcast that used to be great,4,"I generally enjoy Skepticality. It's a decent podcast. However, after discovering it a couple years back, I went and listened to the back archive to ""catch up"" and I really really loved it... it was a bit more quirky and I loved several of the regular contributors.. but in the lst few years, several of those old regulars have stopped appearing and I really find they were my favorite part of the show.
Again, its a really good podcast, but it'st eh past catalog which gets my 5 stars."
1294,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Useful,2,"This is a useful podcast for those who want information on skeptical books, events and activism. The interviews would benefit from editing; they often ramble. Sometimes it seems the interviewer has forgotten there is an audience. Thirty minute interviews can drag on for half again as long. This could be addressed with more focused questioning and better sound editing to keep the conversation moving."
1295,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,A bit generous...,5,"I'm gaming the system a little by giving 5 stars. The truth is these guys/gals aren't the best entertainers. Derek can be a little hard to listen to, especially when reading anything prepared... ""Awkward"" is probably the best description. But there's good information and conversation to be found. I can't knock a solid source for skeptic content, because of a little lack of polish and occasional cringy awkwardness."
1296,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Lost Their Focus,2,Turned into a Trump bashing festival. Sore losers.
1297,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Science!,5,"Lots of ideas I never considered. Challenges me to think, in a good way."
1298,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Irresponsible Podcast,1,"This is actually one of the worst podcasts I have listened to. I have suffered through 10 episodes to give this a chance. As little as that may seem, that is far more research than is put into to this podcast. The production quality is right there with the worst I have come across but you can usually get past that. What you can't get past is that the arguments are very surface level and the hosts and guests are not well versed on the arguments and beliefs of the other side. When they need to fill time, they turn to mocking the subject. Perfect example of ""beware of what you find on the internet""."
1299,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,There is a reason why I don't listen to this podcast,2,"Skepticality gets some amazing folks on to interview, then it's like Jimminy Glick. I could only listen to them fail to hold up to the tallent on the other end of the phone again and again so many times before I had to stop listening, and delete the entire collection from my library. Every interview I find myself thinking ""Gee this would be an amazing guest to hear on the SGU!"" I've met Derek and I like him (though we have disagreed on occasion) but I don't think that he makes a good podcast. But hey, I'm apparently in the minority in this point of view."
1300,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,So Disappointed...the only show that made Penn Gillette Boring!,1,"TOTALLY sounds scripted, read, and non-spontaneous, over-produced and performed by a mush-mouth host. Is this the best Skeptic Magazine can do? Listening to this makes me wanna get religion! Don't recommend this to someone you want to bring to skeptical philosophy...they will run away and never trust your opinion again.
Instead subscribe to The Skeptics Guide to the Universe(SGU), Penn's Sunday School, Skeptics with a K, and The Skeptic Zone."
1301,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Well Done!,4,Fun to listen to and know they have done their homework. (I have checked up a few times and they are right on)
1302,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Very high quality,5,"My favorite of all the freethinker podcasts out there. Their contributing guests are great. Unlike some other, also great skeptic podcasts, skepticality is well scripted rather than discussion-based and they are very good at staying on one topic long enough for it be refreshing without it getting boring."
1303,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Jumped the shark,1,"I used to enjoy this podcast, but it really went downhill about 6 months ago. It's very segmented and runs too long. Also seems like they keep talking about the same thing over and over. Also has the worst theme song of any podcast ever."
1304,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,One of my favorite podcasts,5,Love the interviews and the new format.
1305,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,A good starter podcast for skeptically minded folks.,4,"I have found many interesting people and resources through Skepticality. I stumbled upon it a year ago, so naturally went back and listened to the previous ones starting from the first episode. I should admit that I was a little skeptical about possible hidden agenda, as I had no idea about this fledgling skeptic community such as the good folks in JREF.
Keep up the good work Derek, and bring up Swoopy once in a while."
1306,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,"good, but could be better",4,"Some segments are enjoyable and I have found many of the interviews to be interesting enough. The 4 stars have more to do with the quality of the guests than the abilities of the hosts.
There are enough complaints about the apparent arrogance of the hosts. Yes, it does also sound like they are reading from a script.
Derek needs to practice annunciation! He alternates between rushing through mumbled words and then taking painfully long pauses in the middle of sentences. He speaks so softly that I made the mistake of turning the volume up, which resulted in shockwave of sound slapping me in the face when the music started playing for the next segment."
1307,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Hotchkiss -- Most annoying guest ever?,2,"I listened with increasing frustration to the interview with Jon Hotchkiss of ""This vs That."" Jon: Please stop talking. Stop. Talking. Stop.
Between Hotchkiss unable to shut up and Derek quietly letting him rant on (with occasional ""Very cool"" interjections), I wanted to pound my head against a telephone pole. (Fortunately, my patient dog kept me from injuring myself by peeing on the pole.)
Ironically, Hotchkiss's new show ""This vs That"" sounds very interesting. Of course Derek (""Cool, very cool"") allowed 80% of the show to pass by before we found that ""T v T"" is an Internet subscription show. Still, at $5-10, it seemed not outrageous.
But Hotchkiss WOULDN'T SHUT UP.
I realize he's an accomplished, talented TV/media producer and I imagine a certain amount of hyperbole (""We did a big experiment, big, I tell you!"") is perhaps to be expected, but didn't his handlers ever take him aside and whisper, ""Hey Jon, when you've made your point, JUST SHUT THE **** UP."")
One clue that you're droning on is when you repeatedly say ""Again, as I said...""
Again, I say, Hotchkiss: put a muzzle on it when you've made your point."
1308,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Connection,5,The information they provide is useful and makes me a more effective thinker but I often see many people not exercising effective thought therefore I recommend this podcast.
1309,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,One of the top skeptic podcasts,4,"I've listened to several of the skeptic/atheist-themed podcasts the last 4-5 years, and Skepticality consistently remains near the front. Some episodes are better than others, but the interviews are usually first rate.
The recent additions of ""segments"" led by various semi-regulars range from amusing (""The Odds Must be Crazy"") to repetitive and annoying (enough with the Guerrilla Skepticism...we get it...editing Wikipedia is important and can be misused in the wrong hands..I don‚Äôt need the 5-minute reminder each episode). Overall, I like the new direction, however.
Finally, I think its admirable Derek takes this on mostly on his own these days...it‚Äôs well past time they remove ""Swoopy"" from any marketing materials. She clearly has the more natural ""podcast host"" personality, but Derek has been going mostly solo for a while now...and he deserves a lot of credit for that."
1310,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,"If you like to think, you'll love this show",5,"This show introduced me to podcasting in 2005, and has remained one of the few shows from that time I still subscibe to. If you like to think, you will love this show. If you do not know how to think, then you need to download and listen to every episode. Thanks Derek and Swoopy, its been a great ride..."
1311,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Fight!,1,If a Mortal Kombat character had a finishing move that would murder you with unmitigated full blast pretentious monotone boredom it would be called a Skepticality. I was looking for a good podcast to expand my mind in the vein of Skeptoid (which is far superior) and I am so disappointed I died. SWOOPY WINS. SKEPTICALITY. FLAWLESS VICTORY. toasty!
1312,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Voice of reason!,4,"I enjoy this podcast. However, the woman who keeps talking about going to Manchester, England, England"" annoys me beyond reason. WHY DO YOU SAY ""ENGLAND, ENGLAND""?!? One England is sufficient!!"
1313,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,"Tough to listen to, but great content.",3,"I've been listening to this show for about a year and I'm honestly pretty surprised by how little the listenability of the show has improved. Not a single person involved in the show has learned how to do a line reading. Derek pauses his sentences in the absolute strangest places. Everything he says sounds stilted and irritating. Nothing sounds natural. All of their banter is pretty obviously scripted (but not rehearsed). Learn to read off of a page! It isn't THAT difficult. Enough time has elapsed for this to have improved.
Aside from that, GREAT CONTENT. But I may have to stop listening because every time I get really distracted and irritated by the line reading."
1314,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,I learn a lot from this podcasts,5,Great Podcast. I have been listening to this podcast since the beginning. The podcast has evolved into one of the best pod cats out there. Several of the guests opened my eyes to a great number of new viewpoints.
1315,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,not enough wheat among the chaff,2,"If you're in the ""skeptic community"", you'll probably like this podcast. And you're not the kind of person I'm writing this review for.
A person outside the skeptic community who just wants to hear some interesting information should look elsewhere. There is occasionally an interesting or intriguing bit here, but you have to listen to hours of droning to get to it.
For those who don't know, ""skeptic"" is a code word which means essentially the intellectual equivalent of a bully. Just like physical bullies like to pick on weak people and not people their own size, skeptics spend most of their time not vigorously discussing interesting topics with other intelligent people, but rather sneering at dullards and superstitious and gullible people, and congratulating themselves on being so brilliant for accepting scientific explanations for everything. They all speak in smug and pompous tones of voice that sound like fingers on a chalkboard after a few minutes.
If you're a masochist, by all means listen to this podcast. But if you want something interesting and scientific to listen to, you'll get a much better hit ratio by skipping skeptic podcasts altogether."
1316,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Not getting better,3,"While I enjoy Derek, who I think has gotten really good as time goes on, and the various subjects, it is hard not to have the entire podcast engulfed in how annoying the female interviewer is. After all this time it seems like she either has a cold all the time or is really nervous. Her voice goes into this highs and lows without much reason that I can see. The way she interviews people is really off putting and almost like she didn't prepare any questions and, unlike Derek, she goes out of her way to say something she thinks is smart to impress the guest or maybe the audience. Unfortunatey, she looks like a moron doing it rather than just having a natural flowing conversation.
Honestly, she reminds me of a stereotypical unattractive, plain, boring girl who goes out of her way to sound smart and put down every area she doesn't fit in. For example, just listen to her recent interview about Celebrity Culture. Regardless, her voice is so annoying and her interview style so bad I don't know how the decision hasn't been made to have her only work behind the scenes."
1317,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Unlistenable,1,"The host talks so fast, that I turned it off within the first minute.
I tried again the next day, but after a few more minutes, the ‚Äúphaser‚Äù effect turned me off in its entirety.
If you like to strain in order to get a message, you might like it.
I don‚Äôt."
1318,Skepticality:The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,Awesome,5,This is a very well done podcast. I love all the different voices and the interviews are fantastic. Highly recommend.
1319,Only Human,Wonderful show,4,Love these thoughtful stories that reveal our shared humanity.
1320,Only Human,Really interesting and easy listening,5,"I find this a very interesting podcast but still fun and entertaining at the same time. Good info, great host, def recommend!"
1321,Only Human,Incredible,5,"In fairness, I‚Äôve only listened to season 4. Beautifully done. I dream about telling a complex human story with such clarity and understanding. A profound flip switch flipped for me. I‚Äôm headed to Season 1 and feeling grateful."
1322,Only Human,Aftereffect episodes,5,"I loved this podcast before the aftereffect series of episodes, but somehow my appreciation for the podcast has grown more. Wonderful, human-centered journalism."
1323,Only Human,After effects is so moving!,5,"As the sister of an autistic young adult, I am completely blown away and impressed by the quality and care that the producers are putting into this story. Keep it up."
1324,Only Human,All I want is more episodes!,5,This is one of my top 5 favorite podcasts. (And I listen to a LOT of podcasts.) Wendy is hilarious and the scripted style keeps her on track. I learn something new every time I listen to an episode!!
1325,Only Human,More shows please!!!,5,Amazing podcast. Sad that the last show came out in May 2017... can we please have some more shows?
1326,Only Human,Only Human,5,"I have loved every episode I‚Äôve listened to, and find myself thinking about them long after the fact."
1327,Only Human,Interesting perspectives on human health,5,"A wide range of subject matter begining with the host's personal story and continuing into varied territory such a doctor's abuse of painkillers, the truth about calorie counts, and trans-gender kids."
1328,Only Human,Awesome Podcast,5,The host of Only Human highlights all aspects of humanity in this can‚Äôt miss podcast. The host and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!
1329,Only Human,"Most thought-provoking, interesting podcast",5,"Wow. I am blown away by Only Human. I think it should be ""required listening"" for all incoming freshman - it teaches empathy, kind questioning, and highlights so many of the dilemmas in life. I don't know too many books that do the same. Outstanding."
1330,Only Human,Excellent!,5,Love this podcast. The unique perspective they approach topics of life and medicine has been enriching.
1331,Only Human,10/10 would recommend!,5,Only Human is a great podcast! I lvoe the host and the content. It's super interesting and always fun.
1332,Only Human,Incredible,5,"Only Human has truly become one of my most favorite podcasts.
The episode 'Every (Dead) Body has a Story' was moving, fascinating, and human."
1333,Only Human,"""Rather Have a Living Son""--Amazing",5,"Just finished listening to the August 2nd podcast on transgender children and the doctors and nurses who treat them. It was an amazing, heartbreaking piece about brave teenagers and their parents in an intolerant world which turns bathroom choice into a vicious political issue. Mary Harris--please keep the great, compassionate podcasts coming."
1334,Only Human,Engaging health stories,5,I've just started listening and now I'm listening to all the old episodes. This podcast makes health and health care stories both informative and fun to listen to. If you love story telling with a purpose like This America Life and Radio Lab you will love this podcast.
1335,Only Human,Binge listened to them all and wishing for more!!,5,"It's that good, and relatable, and diverse. I love the wide range of topics but all still within our crazy bodies. Mary Harris is an amazing, intuitive and curious host. My only wish is there would be episodes more oftenüòäüòä but she is a busy mom so I can understand how that goes, the days roll right on by!!"
1336,Only Human,Every story is intriguing.,5,I love the the real life stories of people battling some very mysterious illnesses. I also enjoy that each episode they read and play comments from listeners on the previous episode. It's great to see how the stories touch their lives.
1337,Only Human,Listen While I Work,5,"I listen to podcasts while at work and this is a good one when my anxiety level is high. All of the people who speak have such soothing voices; it helps me relax. I will get some laughs, and learn some things, all while getting my work done. I hope they continue with some episodes."
1338,Only Human,Great!,5,Love the show!
1339,Only Human,So glad your back,5,Your stories are fascinating. I was so happy to see you are back.
1340,Only Human,Refreshing,4,Love listening to meaningful stories about health and wellness every week!
1341,Only Human,My favorite,5,"This is easily my favorite podcast. I love the voice, the stories, the people, the topics. I can't get enough."
1342,Only Human,Excellent,5,Interesting and succinct stories.
1343,Only Human,One of my favs!,5,I love listening to podcasts that feature people making connections - and what connects us better than the trials and tribulations of the human body. Was bummed when I ran out of episodes to listen to.
1344,Only Human,A great resource,5,I work in behavioral health research and this is takes a personal glimpse into why we do what we do with out all the science verbage and makes it accessable for the masses while teaching professionals a thing or two.
1345,Only Human,Fun & Interesting,5,This is one of the podcasts I listen to for fun.
1346,Only Human,thanks,5,for the show
1347,Only Human,Variety & Top-Notch,5,"I recently came across Only Human, and I was delighted to see that there were so many episodes I could ""catch up "" on. The topics of stories and interviews are varied but all of extreme interest. All are told and conducted with sensitivity and professionalism. This podcast offers humor, information, puzzlement. If you want to take worthwhile mental journeys, this podcast is for you. Never disappointing. Never a waste of time."
1348,Only Human,Pretty much perfect,5,Even topics I don't expect to be interested in are explored so well that I'm eager to listen to the whole episode. Between seasons I really miss them and get so excited when the new season comes out.
1349,Flash Forward,Mind blown ü§Ø,5,"I heard Rose on Reset and she was a great guest, so I came over to listen to her podcast. I didn‚Äôt quite understand what the grouped episodes were about so I just scrolled down the feed and picked a random episode without even looking. Well I landed on the Very Big Sick from July of 2018. It‚Äôs about a pandemic. And the accuracy is eerie. So basically this podcast must be a crystal ball and I will be binging the whole thing."
1350,Flash Forward,A must-listen,5,"Flash Forward is one of the only podcasts where I have to listen to every single episode. There's always some surprises, super smart people, great high-quality production touches. Rose is so creative and finds great guests to interview. I love it!"
1351,Flash Forward,It‚Äôs in a whole league of its own,5,"An unique humane, insightful, and thorough window into possible and not-so-possible-but-still-interesting-so-why-not futures. Rose is a delightful host and an impressive journalist, and the plethora of experts commenting on the different escenarios bring a diversity of perspectives and expertise. Can‚Äôt recommend enough."
1352,Flash Forward,"Smart, funny science",5,A really cool premise backed up by impressive journalism - it's a must listen.
1353,Flash Forward,Rose Evelyth is my hero,5,"A unique podcast format that checks all the boxes; great topics, informed guests ranging from industry professionals to revered scientists and researchers, and not to mention an inquisitive, cheerful and intelligent host ;)"
1354,Flash Forward,üôåüçïüôå,5,Brilliant!
1355,Flash Forward,"A Smart, Funny Escape",5,"One of my favorite podcasts for years now - an especially great listen now when I‚Äôm hiding under the covers with my cat trying to forget about the present for 30 minutes or so. Thank you, Rose - you don‚Äôt know what you mean to your listeners."
1356,Flash Forward,What I love,5,When I was a kid I used to dream about future technology a lot. This is exactly what I would have wanted to hear. The explorations of possibilities and the consequences of those choices are so interesting. Thank you for all the hard work you put into this!
1357,Flash Forward,Amazing,5,Heard about this show from Ologies and immediately loved it!
1358,Flash Forward,"Give a listen,Thx Dad Ward",5,"As a regularly listen to of Ologies when I heard the shout out for‚Äù fast forward ‚Äú And wow you‚Äôre great , interesting and just fun. Looking ‚Äúforward ‚Äú
To 2020. And plan a binge of all past episodes ü§ó"
1359,Flash Forward,Scary good but not too scary,5,"I found out about this podcast from Ologies and I love love love it. The host tackles future topics with curiosity, not alarmism, so you can listen and imagine things without getting too stressed out."
1360,Flash Forward,The future is now.,5,"This podcast is so good. I just found out about it and have been binge-listening. Each episode makes me think and question things that I take as a given, be they technology, social structures, or morals. Each episode is well-researched and highly entertaining- sort of like sci-fi with a foot in reality. Highly recommend."
1361,Flash Forward,Easy to digest but extremely interesting,5,"I love all the episodes so far. They‚Äôre easy to listen to, the mini audio skits they do to help portray the scenario is really fun and interesting to listen to. They really help set you into the right set of mind to picture the scenario rather than just say A=B."
1362,Flash Forward,Love it!,5,"Super thought provoking and eye opening with what is going on in the world of science and what we might see in the future. Learning a lot of new things about science, ethics and current events and also having fun imagining what the future may hold. Thanks Rose!"
1363,Flash Forward,LOVE Flash Forward!!,5,"Every episode has sparked very interesting and sometimes heated discussion with my husband about the possible futures we may face. We have both learned QUITE a lot about where our society is progressing or not (space pirates). I thought a podcast that combines storytelling and science wouldn‚Äôt exist but here it is! Thanks for being awesome, Rose!"
1364,Flash Forward,We Need More Podcasts Like Flash Forward.,5,Rose does a wonderful job bring ‚Äúpossible and not so possible‚Äù future scenarios to life by bringing to light the sometimes thorny details what relate to today. It‚Äôs the kind of independent project that uses the podcast platform to its fullest potential.
1365,Flash Forward,"Use this as a textbook, win at life!",5,"I teach ethics, philosophy, and futures studies at colleges. I can‚Äôt count how many times a student has come up with an idea from their own sense of wonder, saying ‚Äúwhat about...?‚Äù More often than not this pops in my mind: ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a Flash Forward on that topic. Here‚Äôs the link!‚Äù
Now, there are still many more topics out there. So please, PLEASE, keep doing this show. It is my favorite podcast of all time (and I listen to 20-25 a week). But more importantly it is an amazing resource to offer to curious students with an over active sense of wonder. Thanks Rose!"
1366,Flash Forward,Wonderful and Unique Look at the Future,5,"Rose looks at many different posssible futures, some more grounded and some more fantastical, and then dives in with experts to see how this future could come about or discuss the implications of the discussed future in a way that ties thing back to the present. It's a great podcast and I hope you'll give it a listen."
1367,Flash Forward,Fun and fascinating,5,So glad this show was featured on 99% Invisible or I wouldn‚Äôt have found it. I love the mix of fictional futures and scientific information. It‚Äôs been reminding me how much I used to love sci fi as a kid. Thank you for all your hard work on these wonderful episodes!
1368,Flash Forward,Speculation + history = awesome,5,"Probably my very most favorite podcast, Flash Forward is an amazing feat of speculative thinking rooted in the actual history of how technologies have impacted society. Rose does a great job of pulling in well chosen experts‚Äînot just scientists working in the field itself but historians and social scientists as well. Super fun and thought-provoking!"
1369,Flash Forward,Must Listen,5,My favorite podcast - Always interesting & entertaining
1370,Flash Forward,Science FACTion!,5,Flash Forward brings us the future in a ‚Äúthis could really happen‚Äú scenario and presents each episode in an engaging and entertaining format. I predict you‚Äôll love it! ;)
1371,Flash Forward,Thought provoking and entertaining,5,"There‚Äôs nothing not to like about this host and podcast. If you‚Äôre a fan of Alie Ward and Ologies, you‚Äôll absolutely love Rose, too. She‚Äôs smart and endearing, and whips everything up into a concise package with a great format. And for the record, I‚Äôm all for you pushing your ‚Äòliberal agenda.‚Äô ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1372,Flash Forward,Putting the Science in Science Fiction,5,"As both a writer and a scientist I love this podcast SO MANY. I love the intros, they‚Äôre all so original and illustrate what the future could be so well. And then the science comes out and answers all your questions about the possibility of every future you can imagine. It‚Äôs so great! I‚Äôve been recommending it to all my friends. Definitely give it a listen, you‚Äôll love it too.
Also, Hi Rose! I thought the intros from the mini seasons this year were great were baller and worked super well. Dunno why people were so :/ about them. I‚Äôm super excited to see what‚Äôs in store in the future. *ba dum tissss*"
1373,Flash Forward,The teleporter.,5,"Excellent show. Wish the trips were longer. About half hour drama, and half hour discussion."
1374,Flash Forward,This podcast always makes me think,5,I love how Rose approaches topics that have potential big changes for us and breaks their implications and possibilities down. Great show!
1375,Flash Forward,A great pod doing all the little things right,5,"I got into the show back in the spring and have been following along since the ‚ÄúBODIES‚Äù mini-season. The topics explored are always great and often are different from other futurist insights I‚Äôve viewed. The scripting is on point, the interviews are intriguing, the jokes are a delight. I‚Äôve enjoy the recent format of linked opening skits, and I‚Äôm sad to see them go, but I‚Äôm sure Eveleth, the host, will continue being creative in framing these future topics. I really appreciate the light content warnings. I love the exploration of concepts like restorative justice.
This is my favorite new show in a long while, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear more."
1376,Flash Forward,"Excellent show, excellent host",5,"I can't suggest one episode because so many are fantastic. The host cares, she's insightful, giving us good stories well told."
1377,Flash Forward,Sloppy.,1,"Fascinating ideas, half-assed research and discussion.
And debating poisioning yourself (""Fitness in a Bottle"") for an entire episode isn't cute or professional."
1378,Flash Forward,Grouping of the prologues,5,"I just started listening a week ago, during my work hours a bit and commutes a lot. I have to say I really dig the grouped prologue mini-sodes. Coincidentally the first episodes that hooked me are the Earth theme season eps, and as a result my favorite prologue was the Snowglobe, even though it was the least popular for the masses. I think they depend on whether you listen to one a week or all 5 at once. I‚Äôm bummed that you‚Äôre halting the practice, but I‚Äôll still listen to everything you put out! Planning to become a patron soon!"
1379,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",I just started this‚ù§Ô∏è,5,I‚Äôve only listened to one episode so far and I have to say I‚Äôm already hooked!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
1380,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Wish I had known this podcast earlier,5,"Brain science is truly fascinating. This podcast talks about the intriguing questions in the field with lots of scientific evidence, reference, insights and inspirations. I love the way Dr Campbell hosts and the questions she asks the guests. Truly thankful that I found this podcast and it has been my best companion since then."
1381,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Simply excellent,5,Invaluable interviews with leading thinker on mind and brain.
1382,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Best brain podcast!,5,"Brain Science is an excellent podcast that digs deep inside the brain with a multidisciplinary approach. Dr. Ginger Campbell‚Äôs format has really helped me learn about the brain. The episodes aren‚Äôt full of fluff and games like other podcasts about the brain/mind, yet Ginger‚Äôs style is never stodgy. She asks tough questions, presents information with consistent clarity, and wraps each episode up with key ideas (that I always find particularly helpful). This is a wonderful resource for beginners, students, and experts."
1383,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Insightful,5,Life changing and inspiring. Thank you for what you do!
1384,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",teacher,5,"Of all the cognitive science podcasts I listen to/books I have listened to/read since the mid-1980s, this one is clearly the easisest to understand, providing valuable information and insights for ALL of us as we struggle to understand ourselves and those around us. Her summaries at the end help the listener retain the information, and her thought-provoking questions about recent studies in brain-science are questions we should ALL be thinking about as we move through our days with others. As an educator for the past 33 years, this podcast it a MUST!"
1385,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Informative!,5,"For the non-science listener, this podcast offers all kinds of interesting and helpful information. Listen and learn!"

1392,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Best,5,One of the best episodes
1393,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Wonderful and Informative Podcast,5,"As a lifelong mental health practitioner, I am fascinated by the information and the guests that Dr. Campbell interviews, and rewarded also by her summaries of the discussions and key points from the interviews. I learn a great deal about the brain and recent neuroscience discoveries., some of which is directly applicable in my sessions with clients."
1394,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",I like brain science podcast,5,"I am fascinated by the brain . Ginger Campbell makes sense of the science, and makes it easier for me to understand. I have been listening to her for several years now maybe even as far back as episode five or ten. I strongly recommend this for any level of interest from Duffer, like me, Or smart guys."
1395,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",This podcast is my jam.,5,"I have been listening to Ginger Campbell from early days. As a physical therapist with a strong interest in neuroscience, these talks are everything. My work will forever be informed by these amazing interviews."
1396,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Just awesome,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast since I was about 22 and I am 31 now, just can‚Äôt say enough about the content and how it almost feels like you know Ginger by now, just love her!"
1397,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Fascinating,5,"I love listening to this podcast. I have always been interested in the brain, but didn‚Äôt know much about it. This podcast really helped me learn more about our current research and our past research with the brain, while making it all interesting."
1398,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Definitely the best neuroscience podcast,5,"I have been listening to many neuroscience podcasts from many creators. This is - by far - the best podcast. This podcast is super high-level-professional as well as super easy to understand. Ginger (the creator) invests so much in each episode. She has great questions and she summarizes each episode at the end. She discusses books and comps them in incredibly deep as well as practical ways. I could go on, but it‚Äôs best if you just listen. Enjoy."
1399,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Brain Science Podcast - excellent,5,I‚Äôve listened to this wonderful podcast for over a year and have learned so much more than expected. I‚Äôve also purchased three books written by guests!
1400,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Covers nearly all areas of Neuroscience Research,5,"I first subscribed to this podcast when I decided to major in Neuroscience assuming it would cover the usual topics discussed in my courses. To my surprise, Campbell has also recently done podcasts covering the subject of consciousness and ‚Äúthe hard problem.‚Äù This ‚Äúhard problem‚Äù is what made me venture into neuroscience research and knowing that consciousness is sort of taboo or placed in a secluded corner in the field it is awesome to see a podcast with distinguished guests go over the topic."
1401,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Great for Everybody,5,"This podcast is an excellent bridge between the latest research and the interested layman. I love Neuroscience, but don‚Äôt have a career dedicated to it. Ginger is great at breaking down the key points of the studies and when appropriate, how to integrate good brain health into your life. I have bought several books recommended by this podcast. Enjoy this information as a Neuro-professional, or just to feed an interest."
1402,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Many thanks!,5,"I savor the info and am so appreciative that Dr. Ginger curates what‚Äôs out there to bring it to us in an accessible form. I imagine the prep for each show is monumental.
Have been listening for years and a year ago became a premium subscriber. These podcasts are a gem for those interested in anything brain science."
1403,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",I Love It!,5,"I'm an undergraduate neuroscience student, and I was so pleased when I found this podcast! I've been listening for about a year and I'm never disappointed. A lot of other (or just science) media and podcasts are either geared towards a layman's audience and isn't very informative (the usual), or sometimes you'll find one that is for such a specific audience that there could only be ~100 listeners. Dr. Ginger Campbell does a fantastic job of not being underestimating her audience's knowledge or ability to learn, while still making a program that most people would have absolutely no problem following.
This podcast gives me an insider's knowledge on a broad range of neuroscience topics. It teaches me in a way that promotes my knowledge as an undergraduate student, while still being something I don't ever plan on growing past."
1404,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Fantastic podcast!,5,"Not only do I look forward to the next Brain Science podcast, but I truly do enjoy Dr Campbell's guests. These episodes will keep you up to date on the latest and great, and are 100% worth the time. Looking forward to the next one, thank you Dr Campbell!"
1405,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Great podcast,5,Ginger Campbell‚Äôs podcast is thoughtful and humane. It is not dazzling and does not waste your time.
1406,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Worth the time to listen,5,Brain Science is an easy to understand podcast that explains so much about neuroscience / brain function from multiple perspectives. Every episode (that I‚Äôve listened to so far) features an expert thoughtfully interviewed in conversation style. I learn several new things with each interview.
1407,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Best podcast!,5,"This is a long overdue review. I discovered this podcast a few years ago and was immediately hooked. I couldn‚Äôt get through the back catalogue fast enough!
The subject matter is fascinating, and is delivered in a way that is highly informative while being accessible to the lay listener. Unlike many podcasts, Brain Science never sacrifices content for gimmicks and sound bites. Excellent podcast!"
1408,"Brain Science with Ginger Campbell, MD: Neuroscience for Everyone",Brain Science with Ginger Campbell,5,I have listened to almost all of the neuroscience podcasts available on iTunes. This is the best if you enjoy listening to challenging and thought provoking discussions with a diverse group of experts interviewed over the latest concepts and research in neuroscience. I give the highest recommendation I can give for this podcast!
1409,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Who‚Äôs in charge of the tech on this,1,"Been a subscriber forever and nothing ever works, better to listen for free, since you can‚Äôt listen to anything any other time. Love to see the avg gpa of their IT team."
1410,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Way too political,1,Hosts like Noory have lost all objectivity.
1411,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Too Political,1,"Noory turned too politically biased. It has gone from annoying to irresponsible by calling COVID fake news. This is not a joke or something to confuse people about. Coast to Coast needs a new host. The tone overall has become solely about supporting Trump. What does that have to do with the unknown?
Update: Noory doubles down. One star! At this point he‚Äôs just being foolish. Noory would believe in Bigfoot but not something which has had real effects around the world. Listen, but don‚Äôt be stupid."
1412,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Keep up the good work!,5,My husband and have decided to keep the tv off late at night and listen to your show via podcast. Always interesting and entertaining.
1413,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Corrupt,1,"I remember when I first started listening to the show 6 years ago, it was an amazing program. And I bet it still is. But I won‚Äôt know. Because I‚Äôm not going to pay to listen to this. There used to be several options to choose from to listen for free. Market merchandise, charge for meet and greets, charge for posters and other stuff. But!...do not take away free radio!"
1414,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,‚ÄúCoronavirus fake news‚Äù,1,The day I unsubscribed.
1415,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Meh.,3,"REALLY miss the Art Bell days! A much better program back then. I think Noory's politics are getting in the way of the good juicy ghost stories. In particular, the March 27th episode. COVID-19, a mind control experiment?? Really?? Americans need to get back to work, at what cost George? There's over 4000 deaths as of today. You're sounding a lot like Trump and for me, thats scary territory man."
1416,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Length,3,I really wish the episodes were longer! I get into them and then boom theyre over üò≠
1417,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Physics,5,"George interviews a very interesting physicist, Jin al-Khalili. The interchange between two perfectly serious minds, both of whom are completely open to what the other is saying, feels as close to the truth as one can get."
1418,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,"Fun, short odd topics",4,Nice short looks into a vast array of different subjects. From paranormal to politics and A to Z you will enjoy a varied sampling of things. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúbest of‚Äù the regular shows offerings so sit back a take a listen.
1419,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,You people are insane,1,"I listened intently to three of these. To give it a chance.
You need to be medicated if you‚Äôre involved in or believe any of this.
I begged google to tell me this was satire and it denied me."
1420,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,George‚Äôs shows,1,"I love Coast to Coast! So one star isn‚Äôt for the show itself it‚Äôs for the change in how we can access shows after they air. With the new App it looks like you can‚Äôt listen to previous shows. These clips are only 18-20 minutes long Hour 1,2,3,4‚Äì Where did they all go? And now when I go to the C2C app on my smart phone and click on the ‚ÄúListen Live‚Äù the spinning wheel of death turns and the show doesn‚Äôt load‚ÄîI have to go to the website to listen live. And I still can‚Äôt find how to listen to older shows anymore. Please bring back the old app‚Äîit was 5 star!"
1421,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Love it,4,Definitely needs to be longer
1422,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Bloomberg Ads? Really???,1,Guess I‚Äôll have to find something else to listen to until after the election.
1423,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Great show!!,5,Just wish it was longer.
1424,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,What happened.,1,This show use to be about paranormal. I can remember not being able to wait for the next show with Art Bell. Nowadays it is just trash half the shows I skip just because of the title name. Can we stop talking about horror movies and lucid dreams. And get back to the real deal of demons ufo extraterrestrials exorcism night terrors and so on.
1425,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Great job,5,"Love the show, I used to listen to you when I worked night shift at 3am. Glad I can listen through the podcast."
1426,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Huckster,2,Any bible reading/believing christian is going to recognize this man a ‚Äúchristian‚Äù fraud. I doubt that he ever was saved with such twisted theology. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
1427,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Disappointing,1,"I had high expectations after this podcast was recommended and was let down by the second listen. It became clear early on that the host, George Noory, is a DT supporter and allows his political leanings to skew the subject matter. Guests are also slanted. Let‚Äôs be honest, all things paranormal, crypto-astral-UFO-related subject matter don‚Äôt give an iota about how you vote, so best to keep it out of the podcast. Unsubscribed."
1428,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Shows,3,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, especially negative ones. I was a listener since Art Bell did political interviews. Believe me that‚Äôs been decades. George Seems to be too busy to do ‚Äúradio‚Äù. He has Gia, his ‚Äúconference‚Äù circuit, which he only holds them where he is apt to draw a large listening base. In other words his selling books and trinkets from the coast store He is all about making as much money while he can for as long as he can. He has moved away from real interviews to be real greedy. Sorry George after 37 years of listening I‚Äôm outta here. I remember when ‚Äúyou‚Äù first started. Art Bell have nothing but great reviews, he said after hearing a few shows he said we found the right host. He said about you that this guy (gets it). He knows what our listenership wants. I left once before and went back. This time I won‚Äôt be back. I‚Äôm not mad, just disappointed. I wish you well and think you‚Äôre great (when you‚Äôre in the studio) T.B. Bossbake8"
1429,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,The move away from Art Bell and the blue collar worker.,5,"It is final for me , the liberal agenda of George is not interesting at all. No real substance of quality. Just mostly focusing on ghosts and goblins and big foot. Art was able to bring in controversial subjects of fringe agendas. Some of those agendas focused on extreemly new and old interesting subjects. George seems disconnected from the subjects and guests. Plus most comments by George are left wing oriented. Very boring stuff.
I‚Äôm done."
1430,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Why!!!?,3,Why can‚Äôt there be full shows instead of short segments!?
1431,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Love the show but...,3,"Not being able to listen to but a whopping 15 min per episode is way beyond annoying. I get it. You all want to get paid from us streaming it on your website, but I honestly think you need to join the rest of the podcast world and let that idea go. The subject matter is usually pretty amazing, but I can get the same stuff elsewhere for FREE, hence the 3 star review. I‚Äôd happily give 5 stars if it were different."
1432,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,‚ù§Ô∏è Slim King,5,"The Professor is fabulous! The departed speak to me also, we are always connected. The energy flows, we are all imprinted."
1433,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,"Ugh, lefty loons go away",5,Love C2C and George Noory!!! Nice to hear a great show & not have to hear anti-Trump LIES.
1434,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Might have to start listening again.,5,"Seems the angry noisy left wing loons are concerned on the reviews, so as an independent I‚Äôm gonna give it a shot again. When they piss, moan and cry it means questions are asked along with the other Fortean subjects.
From the snippets 2017 on, sounds worth a subscription üëç"
1435,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Coast to coast am,5,"Great show!
Get full episodes at coast to coast am website."
1436,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Full Episodes,5,Love the show. Is there a way to subscribe and get the full episodes. I‚Äôd like the like if available.
1437,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,A Shell of What It Once Was,1,"I have tried, with this show, but I just can‚Äôt.
First of all, let‚Äôs play the same sport, on the same field: this is no longer a paranormal talk show, but rather a Right-Wing political and Christian talk show. It feeds the paranoid delusions of an already addled and cajoled audience.
Every once in a great while, you‚Äôll get a good guest and a good discussion will be had, but most of the time, now, you‚Äôre going to get topics that, really, only Conservatives listen to. His ‚Äúnews‚Äù section at the beginning of the show is a platform for, what I‚Äôm assuming is, a paid spokesperson, on behalf of various topics. Politics, pharmaceuticals, aluminum (lol), ALL of them with books to sell.
It devolves from there to the guest, who usually ends up pushing one or more of the following: Right-Wing ideology, homeopathy, Christianity, their books, their pills, their seeds, their MREs, their gold, their coins ‚Äî ALL of it utter nonsense!
Avoid Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. He doesn‚Äôt even sniff the same air as Art Bell."
1438,The Best of Coast to Coast AM,Noooooo,1,Not looking for political opinions.
1439,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Justin enough said,1,Two smart women and then there‚Äôs Justin.
1440,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Alberta Rose,5,"Blair, Kiki, and Justin are exceptional. Love Kiki"
1441,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Favorite podcast for over a decade,5,I started listening to TWIS as an elementary schooler and I‚Äôve had the privilege to follow this awesome show as it‚Äôs evolved and grown! TWIS is a wonderful and accessible way to keep up with science news.
1442,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,So annoying,1,"I‚Äôve plowed through four episodes - I really am interested in the subjects they discuss. But while I am trying to hear the actual science parts, the discussions is always interrupted by the male voice spewing his inane chatter that adds nothing. He‚Äôs so loud and obnoxious - he‚Äôs usually wrong. Skip this series, folks. Try the other series much better: TWIP, TWIM."
1443,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Skip it,1,"Two hours is entirely too long for a podcast. Episode length should ideally be between 30-60 minutes. The man‚Äôs voice is super annoying and the production is terrible. They sound like they‚Äôre talking from inside a can. Also, the structure is loose, rambling, and contains way too many things. It‚Äôs 2019, y‚Äôall. There‚Äôs way more podcasts out there. If I subscribe, I am giving you over 150 hours of my time a year. That‚Äôs nearly a working month. Please edit your show and tighten things up to be more respectful of your listeners‚Äô time."
1444,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Not worth the time,1,"I wanted to be able to like this as a weekly review of things I may have missed, but the terrible audio quality makes it very hard to listen to for extended time. The host that sounds like he‚Äôs intoxicated all the time is tremendously annoying. They seem to like to pound on similar topics every week, and excessive social/political commentary in a ‚Äúscience‚Äù program."
1445,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,"Same old, same old",2,"Occasionally produces new science.
Global Warming is this podcast‚Äôs sermon.
Every week you get another sermon on global warming.
They preach about those who do not accept the scientific method of proving theories.
The people that look for a science podcast accept the scientific method.
They are not delivering hard new science."
1446,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,The original science podcast,5,"These guys were podcasting before podcasting was cool, and haven‚Äôt missed a beat! They bring an hour+ of sciency goodness every week. They sometimes have interviews with special guests and respond to their fans (TWIS minions). Their three person team has debate, brings different perspectives, and keeps it real."
1447,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,The male cohost is TERRIBLE.,3,"One, 2 hours is too much for a weekly podcast. I don‚Äôt listen as often as I‚Äôd like because of this. 90 minutes would be much easier to grasp but 60 would be ideal.
But what TRULY takes the stars off is the dude. Holy mother of all things science is he terrible. His voice is grating, he mansplains and over talks the female cohosts, he thinks he‚Äôs hilarious and you can sense the irritation in the other hosts voices. Can him and I‚Äôd give this another star for sure. He is just AWFUL. ü§¢ it‚Äôs like 2 hours of drunk uncle from SNL."
1448,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Find out why Blarr hates Pandas,5,"Have listened for years and love each episode, learning and laughing and hearing interviews with people that make me feel I need to go back to school... but I was on my phone so...."
1449,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Fun Listen,5,"Definitely a different way to digest the science topics of the week, but worth the time investment!"
1450,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Wide Ranging and Thorough,5,Great for a general audience wanting current events in science.
1451,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,"Fun, sarcastic and caring",5,"The hosts are fun, sarcastic and caring...aka Dr Kiki, Justin, and Blair. I look forward to each episode to get perspective on the week's stories. As someone late to the TWIS party, I also appreciate the moment when I learn the meaning of their inside jokes. Those poor pandas and squirrels never stood a chance."
1452,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Greatly enjoy!,5,"Week in, week out - love the show and its ability to discuss science topics at a good level that anyone can understand. What science coverage in popular media could be."
1453,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Science By Game Show Hosts,1,"I listened to the first 30 minutes of the podcast hoping the sound effects made between the two women, would stop after they introduced headlines (e.g., ""CRISPR alert!"", ""CRISPR alert!"", ""Bing!"", ""Bing!"", ""CRISPR alert!"", ""Bing!"" (the "" Bing!"", ""Bing!""s sounded more like something kids do at Star Wars movies). It did not. ne of them did her best to read with a sexy voice, but would end up tongue tired. The thing is, it was great when she simply read things normally because there was more substance here on one topic than on another top science podcast.
The guy, for his part, tried to keep pace with the women -- reading about a marine science study like a cross between a game show host and cartoon character. It didn't work. He got so tongue tied that he finally couldn't even articulate acronyms.
Maybe this is geared more towards kids or people who don't fancy themselves as being particularly interested in science, but beneath the antics the substance was very good. That's why I suffered through 30 minutes of it.
If people affiliated with the podcast were to read this, I hope they'd consider that it's possible to do a great science podcast with humor rather than antics."
1454,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,I love it!,5,"I am a middle school science teacher, and I love this podcast. :)"
1455,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,SaraMegan03,5,"On behalf of me AND my high school science kids (who love the random tidbits I get from this show), THANK YOU! This show is entertaining and informative.
This show not only tells you about the newest advances in science, but there is a level of explanation in each ""story"" that is digestible and exciting. Perhaps everything in science is fun for me, but they way in which the team gets into the stories really brings them to life for me. I often find myself using what I've learned from TWIS to directly relate to something I'm teaching in the classroom! (I team chem, physics, bio, and environmental science) While telling stories, I like how the team will continue to say things like ""I wonder if the researchers thought about XYZ"", ""the next step for me would be to look into ABC"", or ""the sample size was X so we have to keep in mind blank blank blank"". I really appreciate the team keeping the stories into perspective like that.
Additionally, I love the relationship between the hosts! You guys have great dynamics."
1456,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,TWIS Rocks,5,"Having listened to this podcast from the beginning I appreciate very much the enthusiasm this group puts into each presentation. Basic knowledge of science is a vital underpinning of any progressive society. Science sadly is very much under appreciated in our society. The podcast has become more refined over the years but retains thankfully Justin‚Äôs quirky commentary that adds loving levity and lubricity to the flow of factoids. Blair blends very informative insights and adds an animal twist. Dr. Kiki has provided the momentum, perseverance and environment for accretion of knowledge into our social fabric. Science is a dynamically updated system of observation and application. This Podcast helps demystify and present to the layperson or science junky one of the most important subjects of our time. This group lovingly dedicates creative energy to enrich humanity and it‚Äôs very much appreciated!"
1457,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,"Never mind the bollocks, here‚Äôs some science",5,I‚Äôve been listening for years. Completely invaluable to my life as a person that does not work in the science field but is still interested in science. Keep it coming.
1458,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,I really tried. Justin needs to go!,1,"I tried so hard to enjoy this podcast. I am an avid science fan and podcast listener who donated generously to her favorite projects, but this podcast is a hot mess. Justin is unbearably obnoxious. He sounds drunk constantly, interrupts the female hosts often, and has no idea how to talk clearly. The long silences in the show, the sloppy editing, it's all way too unprofessional. Also, hearing the female hosts allow this ignoramus constantly interrupt them with their nervous giggles is too much for me. Please, this show has potential. Get rid of Justin and have Blair try to talk like a grown up, please."
1459,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Been TWISing for years...,5,"Time to write a review! TWIS I love you and listen to you every week. You always fill my brain with fascinating information and interesting facts about science! What would I do without you? Seriously, quit reading this review and go listen to This Week In Science! (I totally have the theme sing memorized btw.)"
1460,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,I heart TWIS,5,I love this podcast! It's one I really look forward to every week. I feel informed and entertained.
1461,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Entertaining and informative,5,"Wonderfully educational , insightful and fun podcast. Every week I look forward to downloading this and listening to it in the car to and from work. The communicators in this show are really funny and entertaining whilst delivering informative new science news. Great work!"
1462,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Hooked for years...,5,And I will probably be hooked for as long as those three keep it up.
1463,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,"Love it, educating and informative",4,"Keeps me up to date and Kirsten keeps the goofing around at just the right level. Makes me smile while I learn at not too technical level about the latest.
If I could change anything, it would be to tighten up the guest interviews, tighter interviewing to help the guest give the goods and leave more time for headlines and comments from the hosts."
1464,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Great show- grounded in reality and fun,5,"It's a great show I listen every week,
Gives me all the latest science news with a twist of fun and comedy.
See -I used the word ""twist"" which is like TWIS- their acronym!"
1465,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Passionate about science!,5,"A wonderful mix of perspective meet in this amazing podcast! It‚Äôs great and the cast really ties it together, wonderful segments and always some good fun!"
1466,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Very good science podcast,4,"Most reviews are 12 years old?
Wow!
Here is a fresh one.
This is a very good and entertaining podcast, thanks to Dr. Kirsten ""Kiki"" Sanford, whom I have been following since her early days doing food science shows in her white lab coat and her nerdy glasses.
Her team adds much and in a very positive way to the topics that are presented every week.
Their interviews with interesting researchers and educators are very good, also.
I listen to the podcast on my phone, a portion at a time, not the whole hour and a half, but they also have a YouTube channel.
Keep it up!"
1467,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,Ever heard of ETHICS?,1,"I can‚Äôt believe that you joke about monkeys being tested for stress. Are you kidding me? We throw them in a cage, deny them everything natural to their lives, and then we INCREASE their stress levels? And you morons are laughing and joking about it? The Nazies did some great science and had no problem separating ethics from the work that they did, too. You are following in their footsteps.
Please mature and grow up and come to the realization that when you are dealing with living things, there is an ethical cost to the science."
1468,This Week in Science ‚Äì The Kickass Science Podcast,"Good info, but hosts are annoying",2,"I enjoyed the information in this podcast, but the sing song baby talk of the hosts made it unbearable to listen to. I replaced it with the podcasts from Science Magazine and Scientific American."
1469,The Psychology Podcast,my new favorite podcast,5,"If you like in depth conversations by knowledgable and articulate experts relating to the human condition, this is a must listen! Scott is funny, compassionate and super smart! Great podcast!"
1470,The Psychology Podcast,Great Podcast,5,"Very informative with great guests. The host consistently asks insightful questions which helps fuel the convo. This has confirmed my interest in psychology.
His book, ‚ÄúUngifted‚Äù, is worth the read!"
1471,The Psychology Podcast,I love the host!!,5,"Since there was a review bashing the host, I wanted him to know that I like him! I think he is really funny and endearing and I enjoy him as a host/human being. So I hope he doesn‚Äôt focus on the people that don‚Äôt like him, because plenty do :) I love the podcast. Keep it up!!"
1472,The Psychology Podcast,Great but the host...,3,The knowledge in these podcasts is rich. I love having a different speaker with a fresh set of skills in every show. The host is the problem. He has such childlike grammar but then tries so hard to sound smart. Some of his words are so unnecessary. You can tell many of the speakers are annoyed by his interrupting and opinions on knowledge he knows nothing about. He tries to be a one upper which is so unappealing.
1473,The Psychology Podcast,For the emotional psych nerd in you,5,"Recently discovered this podcast and was hooked with the Emotion Scientist episode. If you struggle with concepts like ‚Äúbe more mindful‚Äù or ‚Äújust breathe‚Äù and find yourself going ‚Äúand then????????‚Äù give this podcast a listen. The ideas are supported by science and study in the psychology field, which will appeal to those who are looking for something more evidence based vs. anecdotal ... though the anecdotes are pretty enjoyable as well !"
1474,The Psychology Podcast,Way too long. Gets boring,2,I like some of the content but the podcasts are way too long and tend to get boring. A lot of time I find myself looking at the duration and as soon as I see more than an hour my brain decides not to even invest the time to listen to it.
1475,The Psychology Podcast,Thought provoking show!,5,Dr. Kaufman has done such thorough research and it‚Äôs undeniable when listening to him. Also love his book ‚ÄúWired to Create‚Äù and am looking forward to his new book ‚ÄúTranscend!‚Äù
1476,The Psychology Podcast,A little less rigorous than I would like,4,"I think the host is a great researcher and is very knowledgeable about psychology. I also think he does a good job of having mass appeal while still being fairly evidence based. However, I think that from time to time he has on guests that make dubious claims that just aren‚Äôt backed up by sound science and that go mostly unchallenged by the host. His guests usually cite evidence but it isn‚Äôt alway high quality evidence and sometimes it is cherry picked. This is dangerous. When you start blending good science with bad it becomes hard for the general public to differentiate and you start to damage science literacy. I‚Äôm know it is hard to be knowledgeable enough on every topic to push back when guests over claim, but I wish the host would be a little more skeptical, especially when he has on non-scientists."
1477,The Psychology Podcast,One of the best,5,This podcast is one of THE best in the lane of psychology. Highly recommend!
1478,The Psychology Podcast,This show may have saved my life,5,"This was one of / if not the first podcast I‚Äôve ever subscribed to. A few years ago as a junior film major and philosophy minor, this podcast and SBK‚Äôs book ‚ÄòUngifted‚Äô became indispensable tools for my work. Specifically in my research for a short film I wrote about a very bright black college graduate.
During this time, I was diagnosed with a learning difference and so the research very quickly turned into me-search, which in turn I believe quite easily saved my life. I have overcome a lot of very difficult things. As I learned more about precocity and the twice / exceptionally gifted, I (slowly) began to see myself within the literature and the literature in myself, my buried test scores and achievements.
Scott‚Äôs infectious passion, his work and the array of encouraging and deeply informative guests have provided a trove of many, just-in-time retreats for me, time after time. With it, I‚Äôve learned a lot about a whole lot. And often much more than I came for.
I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough."
1479,The Psychology Podcast,A must-listen for those passionate about all things Psychology!,5,"As a Psychology/Social Science double major, I highly recommend this podcast! I listen to this during my 1 hour commute to and from CWU, and I sincerely enjoy the content of this podcast. Dr. Kaufman has a unique communication style that inspires open dialogue, while critically questioning concepts. The guests are then posed with defending their position with fact, and I certainly appreciate this aspect. Dr. Kaufman has vast psychological knowledge, although he maintains a personality psychology foundation. This wide array of knowledge allows him to host guests from all sub-disciplines of psychology and provoke intelligent conversation. I learn so much from this podcast and it ignites and inspires my day every morning as I embark on my daily educational journey. Thank you for putting the work into this podcast for the benefit of listeners like myself!"
1480,The Psychology Podcast,Like,3,He says ‚Äòlike‚Äô dozens of times per episode.
1481,The Psychology Podcast,Disappointed,1,"The first episode I listened to two was one about bipolar disorder. I was disappointed to hear the host make light of his trips to the Apple store as experiencing manic episodes. And then to hear him laugh about parents being at fault for passing on bipolar genetics was truly disheartening. If he knew anything about bipolar individuals, he would know that having others make light of your experiences makes it more difficult to feel accepted and supported. Not to mention that many bipolar individuals have anxiety/guilt about passing on bipolar to their children, completely lacking in empathy."
1482,The Psychology Podcast,I really want to listen to this but...,3,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first, and certainly hope I‚Äôm not the first, to mention how unbearable the amount of times the host uses ‚Äúlike‚Äù in his conversations. My 12 year old came bounding down the stairs and turned it off because he couldn‚Äôt cope either! I know it has a linguistic function - but dude - Please! Control your words."
1483,The Psychology Podcast,Excellent Interviews,5,I am always intrigued by the guests of this podcast. It is a wide range of great thinkers and I look forward to each one. Thanks for opening my mind.
1484,The Psychology Podcast,For everyone,5,I love how you can be yourself. I also enjoy the variety of different people in the field that you interview in this podcast. I like how there is healthy talks and questioning! I learn something new every time I listen.
1485,The Psychology Podcast,Working with this playing,5,"I don‚Äôt remember how I came across this years ago but I‚Äôm so glad I did.
I am an illustrator and have spent hours listening to SBKs conversations while working. I also relate as some what of a kindred spirit- I am some one who suffered from dyslexia in their childhood like Scott. This podcast is empowering and helps me make sense of the world.
If you ever need any editorial art, feel free to get in touch!"
1486,The Psychology Podcast,Really gets your nogging thinking,5,Allows you to really hear a good conversation that is honest constructible and allows you to think outside your own box and step back and listen to interesting people with diffrent presoectives.
1487,The Psychology Podcast,Brilliant,5,Learnt a lot. Thank you
1488,The Psychology Podcast,A gem,5,I think most of us are interested in psychology...and there are tons of podcasts out there to choose from. This one is unique in that it is solid academically without being boring. I like that he brings in experts and talks about what is and isn‚Äôt known on the subject at hand...but also keeps it fun and interesting! It‚Äôs like taking a psych class again but with a fun and relatable and passionate professor
1489,The Psychology Podcast,Great podcast,5,"I‚Äôve donated to very few podcasts, so the fact I‚Äôve given to support this one means I‚Äôve put my money where my mouth is here! Scott Barry Kaufman is such a likable guy with such a compelling personal story. It‚Äôs a thought-provoking joy to hear him interview psychology experts about interesting topics. He invariably asks the questions I wanted to ask them myself, as well as brings in questions and information I never would have thought of. Highly recommend."
1490,The Psychology Podcast,Excellent!,5,Excellent content for the ones who dig deep into KNOW THYSELF! I have just discovered this podcast and I will keep listening! Thank you for sharing! Best!
1491,The Psychology Podcast,Great for all times,5,I love this podcast! Sometimes it makes me mad but I‚Äôve grown tired of music and planet money and fallen in love with the psychology podcast
1492,The Psychology Podcast,One episode so far,1,2 self-satisfied men in convo. One claims to have coined the expression ‚Äúpsychological flexibility.‚Äù Can you imagine?
1493,The Psychology Podcast,Super interesting and educational!,5,"I recently came across this podcast, I have been looking for a podcast that is stimulating to listen to and that also teaches me stuff, and this podcast covers it way better than I could‚Äôve imagined! So many topics that I have been curious about get covered. I cannot say enough good things. Thank you so much for having this podcast, I feel like I have learned so much in the short span I have been listening. Scott doesn‚Äôt just agree with his guests he also questions them in constructive meaningful ways and I appreciate that so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1494,The Psychology Podcast,Great podcast - must listen!,5,"If you like learning about science in a way that‚Äôs interesting and easily accessible, you should listen to this podcast. I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for around 4 years, and I always get excited when a new episode comes out."
1495,The Psychology Podcast,Intriguing and Stimulating,5,I absolutely love this podcast! Scott doesn‚Äôt come across as conceited nor does he speak condescendingly to his audience or guests. He is seemingly down to earth and discusses a wide variety of psychological and sociological perspectives. I always feel energized and motivated after listening to this!
1496,The Psychology Podcast,Refreshing and rejuvenating!,5,This podcast is honest and and extremely informative. Thank you Dr. Scott!
1497,The Psychology Podcast,A big fan,5,I love the interviews and information presented in this podcast.
1498,The Psychology Podcast,Sound Quality,2,"I wish I could like this podcast and make it a regular listen. The topics are fascinating. However, the low sound quality is not worth enduring when there are so many other great listening options."
1499,Inquiring Minds,Reminders,4,The show is great but it gets old when IV reminds everyone about her neuroscience background 17 times per episode.
1500,Inquiring Minds,Always new things to learn!,4,"Unlike many ‚Äúscience-enthusiast‚Äù podcasts out there, Inquiring Minds hosts covers amazingly wide range (though it helps that Indre has such interdisciplinary interests) and asks guests scientifically rigorous and thought-provoking questions. Although sometimes, I feel like she‚Äôs completing the sentence of the guest speakers...
I love the Up to Date series, the mini 15min series where the hosts talk about their recent journal findings, so I hope this continues even after Kishore leaving the production.
I‚Äôm surprised to see many listeners bothered by their politically charged attitude. Science IS political. We mostly get the grant $$$ from the government and it threats our daily lives when they decide to dismiss science. I do agree though, that perhaps the hosts attitude doesn‚Äôt necessarily help bridge the gap."
1501,Inquiring Minds,Be real scientists ... not advocates,2,"Love the shows where we get objective info. GMOs and Ants with backpacks were terrific. But too many are biased sloppiness. Migration myths is an example. They looked unquestioning at a study which was all positive re migrants. At one point, there was a stat that correlated GDP to increasing migration. Really? You just accepted this? Do you know how many factors go into GDP? In fact, it may be true, but few scientists would simply accept this ... you do consider yourself scientists, right? Ironically, another idea; negative matter in the universe got dismissed as nonsense (which I think it is). So, you only question theories and data that don't fit your biases. Just sloppy. It's these kinds of shows that make me question any study they refer to.
I dropped out of the program for a year or so when most shows were dedicated to bashing Trump. I don't like him either, but I can hear Trump bashing from any of 30 NPR shows.
So, I'll hang on for a couple more to see if they can go back to being real scientists."
1502,Inquiring Minds,Science Feast,5,The breadth of scientific topics is far and wide. This podcast can build your entire reading list with the number of interesting and accomplished guests who have recently published. The up to date series is particularly useful for those that want to keep up with current events. Certainly top quality science communicators.
1503,Inquiring Minds,Great balance,5,Great podcast for science enthusiasts who are not necessarily into the details and language of science.
1504,Inquiring Minds,A Long-time Listener... No More,1,"Female host‚Äôs archly condescending, sing-songy, overly inflected voice along with her Pollyannish cheerleader mentality regarding all things currently cool was just, in the end, too much for me. So I am unsubscribing now after listening to this podcast from the very beginning.
The other thing is her overuse of the word ‚ÄúOR‚Äù when questioning guests. She asks very long-winded questions that are almost speeches in themselves, then tacks on an ‚ÄúOR‚Äù and continues with another speech. It is as if she likes to hear herself.
And yet ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a great question‚Äù is what all her guests say... constantly, and with dismal regularity. None of the guests on my 20 other Podcasts say ‚Äúgreat question!‚Äù more than they say so (when it clearly isn‚Äôt so) as they do in this podcast. Sad.
Call me a masochist, but I stayed for the content... hoping she would clean up her act. But she hasn‚Äôt. She is the same today as she was years ago. So I‚Äôve abandoned all hope and exit stage right from this leftist potpourri of earnest exhibitionism."
1505,Inquiring Minds,Love podcast but have suggestion,5,If the titles were short enough for me to read without have to click on the episode I would listen to more. There are so many episodes that I skip over just because I‚Äôm too lazy to find out what it is about.
1506,Inquiring Minds,Highly recommended,5,"Great hosts and guests, interesting and insightful interviews. Highly recommended."
1507,Inquiring Minds,Please Replace Indre,1,"Interesting subjects and hosts.
Kishore is great.
Indre is hard to listen to."
1508,Inquiring Minds,What happened to science news?,5,"When/why did you guys ditch the intro science news part of the cast. Though I always listen to the whole thing my wife would often tune in for just the newsy stuff if the interview topic didn‚Äôt appeal. Kishore is doing great, but I seem to remember, Indre, you said when Chris left that you‚Äôd bring him back as a guest. Still, Indre, you‚Äôve got the best sounding voice, period. I listen just to hear it!"
1509,Inquiring Minds,Wonderful show,5,"I discovered inquiring minds about two weeks ago and I gotta admit, I am hooked. Interesting subject matter, wonderful theories, and the hosts have great voices for welcoming the listeners. I adore this show."
1510,Inquiring Minds,Gets better and better,5,"This show has always been great, but it keeps getting better whether the guest is Bill Nye on climate denial or understanding the weird ways octopi work. Always worth the time"
1511,Inquiring Minds,Fun to listen to while learning a lot,5,I think my title sums it up. I always enjoy learning new things from listening to Inquiring Minds. One of my favorite podcasts!
1512,Inquiring Minds,Always insightful and inquiring podcasts,5,"The most recent podcast with astrophysicist Janna Levin is stellar. Her book Black Holes Blues, is a beautiful story about a decades long endeavor to build a machine that detected gravitional waves that traved a billion years a ago. Kishore Hari and Indre Viskontas are great hosts!"
1513,Inquiring Minds,Disappointed,3,"I confess, I have listened to just one episode about the differences in women's healthcare. It was interesting and informative. But, the chatter afterwards came off as unthoughtful, and uneducated. Seriously, I am of an age where the Women's Movement of the 70s is personal. And the female announcer's take away is to have separate clinics for women and men. You do understand that the 60s worked hard to rid the country of this very concept: segregation and the Women's Movement worked to try to get us equal rights. There is, I admit, much work to be done as this podcast taught. But the take away to return to segregated care (I remember separate ""colored"" waiting rooms at the doctor's office) will ultimately mean poorer healthcare, not better healthcare, for women and other minorities. Even if not true in practice, it will be true in people's minds. Think before you speak."
1514,Inquiring Minds,Getting to the most important issues,5,Love the wide variety of information and perspectives Inquiring Minds provides the listener. Having recently finished my undergraduate degree in environmental science this podcast gives me a great deal of hope and grows my excitement to tackle the many challenges our society faces. I think the vast number of interviews from perspectives is a great testimate to the interconnected nature of our existence.
1515,Inquiring Minds,Best podcast,5,Always interesting never boring
1516,Inquiring Minds,Fun & Enlightening,4,They offer decent inquiries into subjects. And they do it with a lot of positive energy. They could be more critical in some cases.
1517,Inquiring Minds,Not so subtle liberal mouthpiece,2,"If they could get beyond the political agenda, this show could be really interesting. However, that appears impossible to the hosts. I certainly don't begrudge someone having a different opinion and most people can be open to discussion, but this podcast is too entrenched in its presumed elitist status, telling the common folk how uninformed we are. An unfortunate failed attempt at interesting discussion."
1518,Inquiring Minds,Good!,4,"I just listened to episode 140 that discussed the sound of two black holes colliding.
They talked for an hour but NEVER PLAYED the very sound they were talking about. On and audio podcast. Didn't let listeners hear the very sound of the subject. How did you miss this one guys?"
1519,Inquiring Minds,Entertaining and Educational,5,Episodes are a little long but very well done!
1520,Inquiring Minds,"Great content, but",4,"The content is superb, almost always of interest to me. But the commercials have become so frequent and annoying that my husband and I have both stopped listening. I wish more podcasters would consider Patreon (or possibly advertise relevant products). I listen to a lot of podcasts and am really tired of pitches for razor blades, mattresses, bras, hair dyes, etc."
1521,Inquiring Minds,"Great topics, guest and interviews.",5,Thoughtful intelligent discussions on some of the most important issues of out time.
1522,Inquiring Minds,Becoming Biased,2,"I've been following this podcast for a couple years and enjoyed it very much. But it seems to be tilting to a very ""uber-liberal"" Bay area bias recently such as the unfocused, unscientific, and unenlightening show on lethal injections. If this continiues I'll probably stop subscribing. (Oh, and I am a SCAL liberal so calm down!)"
1523,Inquiring Minds,Shockingly political,1,"How is it that every single ""truth"" discovered and covered by this podcast is a staple of the progressive left? ""I'm not a conservative, but"" is the only approved way to introduce any point not accepted as gospel by the hard left."
1524,Inquiring Minds,Great for discovering new topics and new books!,5,"Inquiring Minds is one of my absolute favorite podcasts. The hosts are smart and personable, and the topics are always fascinating. Many of the guests/interviewees have written books, so the show a great way to find new science books directed at the general populace to read. ‚ù§"
1525,Inquiring Minds,Great!,5,"A terrific, very interesting podcast."
1526,Inquiring Minds,Wide range of topics,5,Love how many varied areas of science are covered. The interview format is great. They seem to ask the guests new questions. Episodes are just the right length for me.
1527,Inquiring Minds,Losing interest,2,"I've enjoyed this podcast by keeping an open mind for a number of years. I used to think they at least tried to find some balance when discussing controversial topics. Over time it has become increasingly clear that the hosts political bias is allowing them to become nothing more than another mouth peice for the far left. I was going to give it one star as a warning that people are growing tired of having partisan politics mixed with EVERYTHING in our lives but hate is a strong word I reserve for a limited set of things and people. ""A Psychiatrist Analyzes the Age of Trump"" was nothing but a hit peice which attempted to use an accomplished physician's experience as an appeal to authority which quickly devolved into a morallity rant not worthy of discerning adults. Far from presenting a balanced set of views on the challenging topics of our day this is just lazy reporting that disrespects a listeners right to draw their own conclusions based on facts in evidence. If you wish to become a podcast that only captures an audience from a narrow subset of the population because you cater only to thier biases you are on the right, or should I say LEFT, track."
1528,Inquiring Minds,Amazing--Climate change episode one of the best,4,"This is honestly one of the best podcast episodes I have ever listened to. I am in awe of the way the story was put together, and how it was presented, and the flow it had. I loved it so much I shared it on Facebook; I know many people probably won't follow through but it will be worth it for those that do. This was totally awesome, and I've never felt more motivated to give feedback for a podcast episode.
Bravo, and keep up the great work!"
1529,Thinking Allowed,Shining a light on the marvel of human behavior...,5,"... in all its glory and horror. Presenter Laurie Taylor and knowledgeable guests explore what we 21st century bipeds are getting up to and how we are going about it. Humanizing humans is not as easy as I thought and I applaud their efforts. Balancing a program that deals with the good, the bad, and the so forth takes a firm hand and a steady determination. Throw in a chuckle or two with some song-bites for spice and the strangeness of people is not only palatable but digestible.
""So when the perils of the perchance guarantee the path is long, Let's have a tickle and a song then carry on, carry on."""
1530,Thinking Allowed,The next best thing to being there,5,"After visiting an old friend in the 9th and falling in love with Paris, I look forward to listing to this every day so I can keep building my sense of that magnificent city. I‚Äôll be back one day, and until then, I savor each one of these with my coffee or while driving."
1531,Thinking Allowed,Another fine program,5,While in the US Army stationed overseas I started listening to the BBC at the behest of British soldiers. That was twelve years ago and I have continued to get my news and podcasts from the BBC ever since. I trust them and ‚Äúthinking allowed‚Äù is one of the most enjoyable podcasts from the BBC. Every week I am exposed to something of importance or relevance that I find the utmost pleasure hearing and learning about. Keep up the great work!!!
1532,Thinking Allowed,Inconsistent,3,"Sometimes great, sometimes not."
1533,Thinking Allowed,A wonderful podcast,5,"Almost a public service, in my opinion. I enjoy every show. A valuable podcast in education to the public."
1534,Thinking Allowed,My favorite BBC podcast,5,I really love the approach and topics discussed in this podcast. As a laborer and someone atypical of a podcast listener Laurie is eye opening and sheds light on some things I'd have never considered.
1535,Thinking Allowed,Interesting content,4,"An interesting popularization of social science, though I'm typically only interested in downloading about half the shows that come up, topic-wise."
1536,Thinking Allowed,Love it!,5,Very helpful and thought provoking!
1537,Thinking Allowed,Absolutely,4,"I listen to the weekly episode of thinking aloud each Sunday morning in Papua New Guinea during my 6 km walk which lasts an hour. 30 minutes listening to thinking aloud followed by 30 minutes of Friday night comedy.
What has struck me about all the social science guests you interview is how many guests answer your questions with the response "" absolutely "". This must mean 100% agreement with your questions. This must be a special characteristic of social scientists compared with politicians. I have yet to hear a politician ever use the word ""absolutely "" in response to a question from an interviewer. Why can't politicians learn to use the word ""absolutely "" in their replies. That would transform politics. Or maybe social scientists should become politicians.
Regards
Michael Thomas"
1538,Thinking Allowed,Intriguing and fun,5,"Great, wide ranging discussions. Big topics and arcane trivia you can use at your next soir√©e."
1539,Thinking Allowed,Thinking indeed!,5,_Thinking Allowed_ is an excellent program. It goes beyond mundane conversation and is invariably intelligent and interesting.
1540,Thinking Allowed,Great listening!,4,"I have enjoied every episode I have listened to. He has a great voice and the stories are diverse and interesting, and full of information!"
1541,Thinking Allowed,Decent Show,3,"It's not quite as intriguing as the In Our Time podcast, but it's the best runner up I've come across so far."
1542,Thinking Allowed,Riveting!,5,Very riveting and intellectual discussions about just about everything. I'd recommend if for any curious person who enjoys hearing Brits contemplate the world....
1543,Thinking Allowed,Fantastic find!,5,"I've been scouring the podcastsphere for commute-worthy entertainment, and this one is wonderful. So refreshing to find such a well-researched, thoughtful, and insightful show after wading through so much blah. Thanks!!"
1544,Thinking Allowed,Thinking Allowed,5,"I love this show! I find Laurie Taylor to be an excellent host. Topics are varied and interesting, and he does a masterful job of eliciting the maximum information from his guests. Best of all, he speaks well and can be clearly understood - and he doesn't interrupt his guests, but lets them get out all the information they have for us! I'd take his courses every semester!"
1545,Thinking Allowed,Wonderfully informative and witty!,5,Ôºº(^o^)Ôºè
1546,Thinking Allowed,"Excellent, Excellent Podcast",5,"It is truly refreshing to find a podcast that treats subjects in the social sciences in such an entertaining way yet takes them quite seriously. Listening to Thinking Allowed is like enjoying a thoroughly delicious meal with the added satisfaction of knowing that it was healthy and nutritious.
Laurie Taylor is a gracious host with the ability to truly engage with the subjects and guests at hand. I have to say that I'm constantly impressed at how far-reaching his reading seems to be - it's something I can only aspire to. He has got a devoted listener in me."
1547,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Cool! Love the intro and exit musical theme,5,Awesome science podcast.

1552,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Love this show but....,5,Hate the intro and outro music. It sounds like a heavy metal guitar got stuck in a blender. Put in some spacey atmospheric sounds instead. Wakes me up several times at night.
1553,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Intro music,5,"Great shows but please KILL that intro and closing music. It‚Äôs mood, and especially its sound, do NOTHING to attract and keep me as a listener; more often, I turn the volume down during the opening and then delete the entire show as the closing tune starts."
1554,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Nice Concept,5,"This podcast brings you episodes from a variety of astronomy podcasts, some of which are hard to find if you don't already know about them. They vary in quality, but there are a lot of great ones."
1555,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Intro music bad,4,I suggest making the intro song Astrothunder by Travis Scott
1556,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",The intro music is terrible,4,It‚Äôs good to get astronomy podcasts but the intro crazy guitar solo is terrible. It is a horrible piece of music. Almost anything would be better.
1557,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Stellar podcasts,5,"Cool to hear so many different people from all over the world: parents, professors and professionals all sharing their enthusiasm and personal knowledge. It makes you appreciate how accessible this science is, and that anyone can take part in contributing. I will omit my opinion of the jarring intro music - Subscribe to the 5-part weekly podcast and reduce the impact by 80 percent! Many places to explore starting here!"
1558,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Wonderful.,5,"Thanks so much for creating such a cool podcast. Enjoyable and educational, it's worth a listen for those who know about the stars and for the casual observer."

1561,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Great shows (now with slimmed down theme song!),5,"Still crazy good after all these years.
Excellent variety, breadth and interesting POVs. Something new every day for 2.25 years and consistently high quality. (Maybe two clinkers in all that time!)
And, while George Hrab's theme song was a hoot, I'm glad to have the trimmed down theme after listening to it some 700 times...Thanks for that."
1562,"The 365 Days of Astronomy, the daily podcast of the International Year of Astronomy 2009",Love It love It love It!!!,4,"Except teaching EVIL-ution is a fact and not a theory annoys me greatly! If it were a fact then there would be no debate. I wish these dogmatic scientists would realize this, they are no different than the Pope teaching hellfire and purgatory as fact. How could all these countless stars and galaxies be by an accident? That's like throwing a million numbered balls in the air and expecting that when they land they'll be in numerical order..... It'll never happen no matter how many times you try. It's like the house we live in, never in an infinite amount of time will all the materials needed to make one, fall together and make itself on it's own, it's against all logic. So why would the universe be any different? 90% of religionist make God look crazy and that's why people look for an excuse not to believe in a creator and I have to say I don't blame them. But keep looking and you'll find a group who makes him look like the loving awe inspiring creator that he is. The one that ""causes to become""..."

The information in these podcasts by Lewin is informative and provides simple steps that I am taking to make sure that I make the most of this once in a lifetime opportunity. More importantly, he offers up tips on how to safely watch the eclipse, which is very important to me as the father to 2 young boys. Cheers to this Canadian-born, all-star of a ""podcaster!"""

Dr. Sutter‚Äôs arrogant mocking of the decline of the once brilliant Stephan Hawking, his dismissive description of past Nobel prize winners and tendency to deride others work and constant solicitation / sales pitch for his latest trip is a bit too much.

Its unfortunate that this ‚Äú Astronomy podcast‚Äù doesnt focus more on astronomy & cosmology and less on politics.
Never a shortage of partisan politics in media, not even on my beloved astronomy show.
I guess its more of a platform to promote a silly political view and less for one promoting science and astronomy.
It figures....."
1577,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Always a great listen,5,The world of sound is such a diverse topic that it allows for a huge range of very interesting and immersive topics.
1578,Twenty Thousand Hertz,I Love It!,5,This is a great show! Always interesting subjects in sound that you never think about or sometimes great subjects that you are simply not aware of. One of my favorite pods!
1579,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Healing power of CAT PURRING,5,"Wonderful show ! How about a show on Purring ? That the hertz vibrations of a cat‚Äôs purr is healing ‚Äî to humans too ! (I sleep with my head on my cat, I am convinced that I have been purr-
Therapized on many occasions (especially now being quarantined with cats). At some point research was being done on this by a university(?) in North Carolina (?)

1587,Twenty Thousand Hertz,20K Audio,5,"I have impaired vision, and find it difficult to read books etc. So I listen to many Podcasts. 20K is one of my favorites, and never get close to the mystery sound. Dallas and the team do a great job and produce a quality podcast. I‚Äôve done sound mixing and know how tough it can be, great work guys!"
1588,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Sound lover,5,"It is awesome to find a podcast that cares about the sounds around us. I am blind and sound is a huge part of my life! Thank you Dallas Taylor and the rest! know how they made the sound effects in The Six Million Dollar Man, and the Bionic Woman. I would like to"
1589,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Really really good stuff,5,"I used to work a job where I could listen to podcasts all day. I don‚Äôt now which is a shame. However, this was always at the top of my list. I really love this show and when I first discovered it I binged for a couple days until I got caught up. I still manage to stay up to date with new episodes most of the time. But when I miss it for a few days I always have a great time listening to a few in a row.
This is easily my favorite podcast out there. Give it a listen, it‚Äôll blow your mind. The virtual choir episode is a great place to start."
1590,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Great stuff even for us nontechies,5,"I‚Äôve been composing music all of my life and I play many instruments. I am in no way a techie. I love to learn and this podcast teaches me amazing aspects of sound. The music draws me in too.

1593,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Fascinating,5,A great podcast that explores everything from the the often ignored sounds in our everyday lives or the history of well known jingles. Definitely worth your time.
1594,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Love 20k Hz,5,Dallas‚Äô calm and smooth voice is still filled with excitement as he shares amazing sounds from all over. It‚Äôs amazing to learn about the sounds from the world around us which are often overlooked.
1595,Twenty Thousand Hertz,ÊÑüË∞¢,5,Thanks Dallas for a wonderful podcast. So smart and entertaining.
1596,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Amazing,5,My dad introduced me to this podcast and I have listened too every episode and loved every single one I love it
1597,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Show idea,5,"I really love this podcast, and as an organist I think you should do an episode on organ music, specifically the theater organs used to accompany silent films in the 1920s and 30s. It‚Äôs a really unique sound, and sadly it‚Äôs almost been completely forgotten today."
1598,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Love it,5,"Great show, simple as that."
1599,Twenty Thousand Hertz,One of my favorites,5,I look forward to this show every week
1600,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Totally absorbed in this entire podcast,5,"First time I felt a need to comment on a podcast. I have been listening to podcasts for several years but subscribe to very few. Having spent over 20 years in the r&d of architectural and environmental acoustics, I really respect the broad range of subjects and professionalism. Oh yeah, very entertaining as well. Thank you"
1601,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Had to downgrade their rating,2,"After the 4‚Äô33‚Äù episode, I almost deleted the feed. Just the sheer laziness and disrespect to both Music and the art of listening is ridiculous. He keeps talking about playing what is nothing. It‚Äôs nothing because the ‚Äòcomposer‚Äô has nothing to bring. Then we get all this absurd navel gazing about it‚Äôs supposed to make you listen. That is called listening, and people have been doing it for thousands of years, and whereas you could feature some truly great people working in Nat Sound and Ambient Sound, no instead, you feature this talentless hack. It is so disrespectful to people who are truly creative in either the music field, or those who delve into conscious listening, and especially those who combine the two. It is really sad, pathetic, and lazy, and is truly beneath the level of this once thought provoking podcast. I think you should acknowledge that you have hit a wall and either take the pod in a new direction or end it gracefully.
EDIT: After much thought and reviewing the latest episodes in the feed, I did delete the feed. This podcast has run its course and no longer has anything to offer me worth spending the time on it."
1602,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Fascinating episodes about all things sound-related,5,"I am continually impressed by the profound and fascinating information that comes out of this show, always presented in a simple and digestible way."
1603,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Awesome,5,"I love this podcast!! The episodes are very interesting and cover a variety of topics that have to do with sound, music , and the people involved with the industry and it‚Äôs evolution! It‚Äôs my new favorite podcast! Thanks for making my commutes so much better!"
1604,Twenty Thousand Hertz,I hear the frequencies,5,Great podcast!
1605,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Music to my ears :),5,"If you enjoy music, podcasts, or just speaking with other people, then sound is probably important to you. 20 thousand herz has completely expanded my appreciation for all the sounds that enrich our lives: some common, and some rare. From whale songs to mysophonia to ASMR, these beautiful podcasts will expand your sound-horizon."
1606,Twenty Thousand Hertz,Wonderful,5,This podcast is great. It sounds wonderful and has interesting topics. Thanks
1607,Rationally Speaking,Stanford prison experiment,1,"The critics were equally undocumented as the study. That can change significantly when the paper gives evidence rather than hearsay. It was an hour of he said verses a hypothetical they say, without appropriate citations."
1608,Rationally Speaking,Most recommended. I love this show.,5,"I subscribe mostly to podcasts that discuss complex ideas and I repeatedly find that Julia Galef‚Äôs Rationally Speaking is my most frequently recommended podcast. No matter your background knowledge or inclinations, there is brilliant stuff going on here. I learn valuable new things and stretch out my worldview every time."
1609,Rationally Speaking,I want to like it but I can‚Äôt,3,"Good content, poor delivery. It‚Äôs hard to listen to a podcast when I find it so hard to listen to the host...they‚Äôre just sort of annoying and they interrupt all the time! Ugh! Wish it was just the guests"
1610,Rationally Speaking,This is gold!,5,The Stanford Prison Experiment episode blew my mind
1611,Rationally Speaking,Great Interviewer,5,Julia is hands down the most thoughtful and incisive interviewer I‚Äôve ever heard. Essential listening.
1612,Rationally Speaking,Brilliant,5,"Julia is a pleasure to listen to, she prepares for interviews and asks smart meaningful questions!"
1613,Rationally Speaking,Best interviews,5,"JG is the best interviewer, period. Humble and generous, incisive and brilliant. Guided by a strong ethical and epistemic compass. Essential listening."
1614,Rationally Speaking,"It keeps Improving with Age,",5,"This show has gotten better every year. I do miss 2 hosts (maybe they can find a 2nd in the future?) as it allowed for more broad discussion, but Julia does an outstanding job of applying reason to all topics and does not let guests get away with claims they cannot back up with something approaching fact or at least best current knowlege or concensus thoughts. I'm 70 shows in and hope that by the time I'm all caught up I myself can think so rationally!"
1615,Rationally Speaking,Outstanding!,5,Intelligent discussions about subjects we should all pay more attention to.
1616,Rationally Speaking,Epistemologically Sound; Radically Charitable,5,Julia is just really good at this. Check out the Tania Lombrozo episode! I could listen to it on repeat and keep getting insights each time.
1617,Rationally Speaking,NYC Skeptics blew it,1,NYC Skeptics sponsor this podcast. The recent debacle with uninviting Dr. Richard Dawkins from upcoming NECSS is very telling that NYC Skeptics really have drunk the SJW kool-aid. They crossed the borderland from reason and dove straight into nonsense.
1618,Rationally Speaking,Good,5,Great addition to our podcast library.
1619,Rationally Speaking,Excellent,5,Good Job
1620,Rationally Speaking,Openminded and Curious,5,"Julia and the guests have wonderful discussions that explore surprising insights, clever solutions, and academia. Very evidence focused. Topics seem to focus on economics, sociology, philosophy, and philosophy of science."
1621,Rationally Speaking,"Engaging, informative, refreshing",5,Thank you Rational Security for doing this podcast despite no sponsors etc. I am so thankful to have found y'all to add to my media diet!
1622,Rationally Speaking,Great show,5,Fascinating discussions of the highest quality
1623,Rationally Speaking,download and listen,5,"Your first stop if you want to strengthen the rational part of your brain. Great conversations spanning topics in philosophy, the social sciences, and the natural sciences."
1624,Rationally Speaking,Science meets philosophy,5,Very intellectual and interesting especially to me who loves science and philosophy.
1625,Rationally Speaking,Excellent,5,"I enjoy Julia's curiosity and persistence in seeking meaning. Also, her sense of humor... This podcast has helped me in daily life and interacting with others, especially other people who dont share my world view."
1626,Rationally Speaking,Gregory Clark's disturbing eugenic theory,2,"I enjoyed learning more about philosophy in earlier episodes, but was disturbed when I heard Gergory Clark's disturbing statement in Episode 184 that ""that the majority of people's social status is actually genetically determined."" I'm disapppointed the host did not challenge him or recognized that he has such beliefs."
1627,Rationally Speaking,Important and delightful,5,The content is really valuable. Julia masterfully maximizes each conversation. And the guests are top notch. This is easily one of the most important resources out there. It's even helped me with my dissertation. Thanks Julia et al!
1628,Rationally Speaking,Outstanding,5,"This podcast covers a wide range of science, skepticism, philosophy. The topics and guests are great, the pace is upbeat and entertaining, the chemsistry between the interviewers and the guests is delightful. If you want to be entertained while learning new ideas this is a great podcast."
1629,Rationally Speaking,Very academic.,5,The title of the show implies this is a skeptic's podcast - and perhaps it was originally conceived as such - however it's closer to an interview show focusing on research and academia. The host exercizes clear-thinking as she discusses topics with her guests and I enjoy the model of questioning and logic.
1630,Rationally Speaking,Awesome,5,Thoughtful discussion par excellence.
1631,Rationally Speaking,Julia is Amazing at This,5,Keep the thought provoking content coming please. The world is counting on you
1632,Rationally Speaking,Great guests and brilliant questions.,5,The guests are all very ineresting and the discussions and questions are brilliant.
1633,Rationally Speaking,Why I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars?,5,"Because listening all episodes from the beginning and if I find myself drinking coffee together in a Starbucks, I‚Äôd probably embarrass myself to act like I have never listened one episode. She can outsmart not only me (who learned English when he was 13 for the first time) but people like ordinary and smarter than ordinary and smarter than an educated person in statistics (herself)
She is a living shameless.
Smart enough to be able to part of go to work and be an ordinary girl type of choice, instead she is interested in philosophy not money. How rational is that? She must be crazy to read all that @&$)it. YOLO baby! And she never answered any question about anything because it is not even wrong and spending that amount of worthless time to anyone with a certain type of filter, well stuff start to get complicated and nobody is a fun of meaningless drama times.
Give yourself a free gift and start listening this show.
The reason why I won‚Äôt talk is to listen her. Because sometimes just listening is enough."
1634,Rationally Speaking,Teaches you how to think,5,"Julia Galef interviews top academics and thinkers for about an hour in each episode. She takes a deep dive into a particular topic that the interviewee is an expert on, such as Newcomb's problem, Preference Falsification, Pascal's Wager, Industrial Revolution, Buddhism, and so on. The topics usually revolve around psychology, philosophy, and economics. She takes great care to get very clear on what the interviewee is saying and pushes back on their views by offering counterarguments and counterexamples. She also articulates her own intuitions and views on the show before asking the academics their more nuanced opinions. Quite apart from all the interesting things you will learn on the show, you will also how to think things through. Highly recommended."
1635,Rationally Speaking,This podcast has had a profound and overwhelmingly positive impact on the way I approach thinking,5,"Julia Galef owns my very favorite brain. From the first run of episodes with Massimo very much in charge into the new era with Julia steering the ship solo she continues to display an almost preternatural ability to ask teh questions I was thinking. Her laid back personable tone and meticulous dedication to preparing for each episode makes each episode feel like the most inviting coffee house discussion immaginable. I regret that my life is too full of other academic persuits to focus on these matters as much as I would like to, but I am deeply grateful to have Julia here, keeping track of so much interesting work, and reporting back on it."
1636,Rationally Speaking,Love it!,5,"I learn more from this show than almost any other. Thanks Julia, keep up the good work."

1639,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,great podcast,5,you really get to see the love they have for their work
1640,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Too short to be interesting,1,3 minute podcasts? Do you really think your audience can't sit still longer than that?
1641,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Awesome!,5,Keeps me informed.
1642,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Great content, but...",3,"Too often, the files are unplayable, flawed, or not deliverable, thus denying me access to view the stunning imagery that accompanies these informative vidcasts. This is a great vidcast when viewable. However, NASA, JPL, and Apple have NOT resolved its delivery and viewing problems."
1643,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Year in pictures,4,"Great video, It would be much nicer if you could click on it to pause and view the picture for a longer period of time. Other than that it was excellent."
1644,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Does not work on ATV,2,"1. It takes virtually no effort to make this in a format viewable on ATV (it already works on QT).
2. Itunes once again does not know what its extremities are doing, as its STILL listed on ATV menus and as viewable on the ATV."
1645,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Not AppleTV Compatible,3,"Excellent vidcast, but please begin distributing in a format that is compatible with the AppleTV"
1646,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"Do not subscribe. Sorry, NASA.",2,"This could have been a great podcast. It really could have. The problem was that out of several weeks of subscription, I am yet to view a flawless episode. The video is broken, and sound is cut off in places. where it does work, it looks great, but there are simply too many breaks and freezes for this podcast to be any good. Thus: good idea, horrible quality"
1647,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Amazing,4,"It's mind boggling that they can get those things so far out in space and get then data and pictures back for years. Send more robots to planets! As far as I know, they don't jealously assault rivals or get drunk before flights."
1648,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Awesome!,5,"This podcast great and very interesting. A must for everyone interested in science.
The only criticism I have is that it does not play on the AppleTV. The frame rate is probably too high (29.99) for 720p. I guess that if it were encoded at 24 fps it would work."
1649,HD - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Not Enough!,5,There is simply not enough podcasts. NASA needs to upload more for my viewing entertainment. NASA should also make HD broadcasts of NASACast and others.
1650,MonsterTalk,Monster Talk,5,"A fun podcast that takes a scientific approach to your favorite monsters, myths, and legends. Love it for my daily commute!"
1651,MonsterTalk,More Monsters!,5,"Everyone (almost) loves monsters of one kind or another. Blake, a one-time 'true believer' has retained that love of monsters while being firmly rooted in reality. Karen is a productive associate providing useful data and a lot of flavor. Cryptids, mythological, folklore and modern - monster talk reviews new, and sometimes old information about monsters from experts in the field. He is respectful of different opinions and does a great job of presenting those opinions without insult."
1652,MonsterTalk,Amazing listen,5,"I absolutely love your podcast! It‚Äôs an interesting listen, you bring up points I have never considered and being someone who loves monsters or folklore creatures and is an anthropologist, I especially enjoy hearing the guests who come on the show. I‚Äôve almost ran through all the episodes just during my work hours because I love hearing the topics and learning a bit more.
Keep up the good work!"
1653,MonsterTalk,Love this pod!,5,You guys put the ology in Cryptozoology! By that I mean that you guys take a scientific take on these topics. I love the way you approach skepticism. It allows those of us who have had strange experiences be able to look at those experiences in a different light without feeling ostracized. Love your topics! Keep doing monster talk! You are the sound track to my morning runs!
1654,MonsterTalk,Still my favorite,5,"MonsterTalk was my first venture into skeptical material When I came across it back 6 or 7 years ago and is still my favorite! Highly accessible, informative, and entertaining."
1655,MonsterTalk,Such Fun,5,"I‚Äôve enjoyed this podcast for a while now, the hosts Blake and Karen do a wonderful job to talk about monsters and other topics in a open and inviting way. The skeptical but not derogatory nature of the show is refreshing. Normally, they do discuss why these scary things aren‚Äôt really, but you can always tell that they (especially Blake) wish that some of them were real!"
1656,MonsterTalk,Love it!,5,From the puns to the topics this show is awesome. They make a skeptic show about monsters fun!
1657,MonsterTalk,Monster Fun,5,The topics are well-researched by the hosts as well as fun to listen to. I particularly enjoy the obscure anecdotes that can lead one down any number of rabbit holes. This podcast also provides a welcome reprieve from following bleak current events.
1658,MonsterTalk,The perfect counterpoint to those supernatural shows,5,This program uses science and demonstrative rational thought processes to expose the misdirection and manipulation exercised by those ‚Äúedge‚Äù sites.
1659,MonsterTalk,Interesting and fun podcast,5,"I liked listening to the old Art Bell show but never was a believer -- it was all just interesting stories to me. This is a show in that spirit, looking skeptically at paranormal myths and stories and at what they (and the belief in them) say about humanity and society."
1660,MonsterTalk,Love the show,5,"I love the show and have listened to three years worth in the last week! :-) I find the guests fascinating and have learned more than I anticipated. Great hosts, great guests, humorous and informative!"
1661,MonsterTalk,Oof,5,I‚Äôm his daughter. I like this show -3-
1662,MonsterTalk,Pretentious Dingbats,3,"These wannabe, condescending dorks mansplained that cattle ranchers wouldn‚Äôt know what a decaying cow would look like - thus cattle mutilations don‚Äôt happen... I just can‚Äôt."
1663,MonsterTalk,Best Podcast,5,"I have been a listener of MonsterTalk for many years now. Blake always mentions leaving a review, and I never really looked at how many reviews they have.
There are newer podcast that try to cover alot of the podcast on MonsterTalk. There is no podcast that has ever been made better than MonsterTalk for people who want actual good information. A few other podcast have big names, and large funding to get larger review base, but the content of the actual podcast fail compared to MonsterTalk.
I Love what Blake and Karen have been doing for so many years. This podcast is a must for anyone interested in the science behind monsters and the scientific method applied to finding answers.
Keep it up Blake your efforts, time and informatoin is greatly appreciated."
1664,MonsterTalk,Needs significant polishing,2,"I was initially led to this podcast by a shout-out from a similar podcast I enjoy so I decided to give it a shot; I have to say I was disappointed. While the subject matter covers topics I‚Äôm interested in the actual format I found to be really lacking in organization and coherency. The primary host sounds to be in-studio while the co-host I think phones in; there is a significant lag between responses.
Having said that, the first episode I listened to was an interview with a film director who covered small town monsters. I found the interview to be hard to listen to as the main host seemed to jump around, talked about himself to an uncomfortable degree (seemingly even for the director) and didn‚Äôt seem to have a plan at all for the interview as the host jumped all over and often interrupted his guest. I was honestly almost embarrassed for the host because it didn‚Äôt seem like he had any experience interviewing guests in a professional manner.
I listened to another episode giving the honest the benefit of the doubt but I was unfortunately met with more of the same. The host was apparently trying to explain the history of the topic but in doing so provided little in-depth detail and actually said something to the effect of ‚Äúyou know, typical stuff‚Äù in the context of supposedly giving us the background of what typical stuff even is. I just got the impression the host isn‚Äôt very mindful of his audience or really even his guests or co-host who does her best to contribute when the host isn‚Äôt cutting her off. If you are someone who appreciates well put-together programs that flow and are organized this one will likely drive you crazy.
I have to stick for the co-host also because it sounded like she really was doing her best and in fact I would have appreciated hearing content just from her instead of the host. She appeared to be more insightful on the topics and appeared to have done her homework.
I was bummed this one didn‚Äôt do it for me as the podcast covers really cool topics like MIB, cryptids, ufo‚Äôs, etc. In my opinion the podcast could do with some polishing to make it more followable and engaging."
1665,MonsterTalk,Really surprised how much i like it!,5,"I only planned on listening to the 2 episodes on the pterodactyl and plesiosaur because podcasts on dinosaurs are hard to come by. I don‚Äôt consider myself at all interested at all in big foot or the chupacabra and such- but here i am about 20 episodes into the series. The guests they have on the show are very engaging and knowledgeable about the topics, not at all kooks as i was expecting, actually people of science!
Gotta say im going to listen to the series start to finish in a few weeks at work and buy a lot of the books the guests wrote- you guys got me."
1666,MonsterTalk,Why bother?,1,Why spend so much Time chopping away at paranormal? Why would so many people bother to listen to a dissection-blow by blow- of ...? Ghost stories? Really? Bye.
1667,MonsterTalk,Leave the politics out of the show,1,"I started listening a long time ago for interesting paranormal stories. Lately there has been a lot of political discussion, as if we don‚Äôt get enough politics literally everywhere else we look. There are too many other good podcasts to waste my time with this one any longer."
1668,MonsterTalk,Really Interesting Podcast,5,"I really have enjoyed these podcasts! Excellent interviews with scholars doing some really interesting work. I‚Äôm a conservative, and maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an academic, but I kind of expect to hear ‚Äúmy side‚Äù take a beating during the course of academic discussions. I think a lot of scholars want to find a reason for the ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù of their work‚Äîand their audience is typically left-leaning, so it usually doesn‚Äôt backfire to make comparisons between, say, Nazi pseudo scientists and ‚ÄúClimate Change Deniers.‚Äù Say whatever you want to say about politics‚Äîit might piss me off, but I wouldn‚Äôt want people downrating a podcast I did because of stray comments that betray my annoyance with the ‚Äúother side‚Äù (or my own side). People are political animals, so these biases are going to come out, and that‚Äôs fine. I particularly enjoyed the one on grimoires, and I wish you all the best. Thanks for giving of your time and resources to make life a little more interesting for the rest of us."
1669,MonsterTalk,Real name of podcast ‚ÄúMonsters are boring nothings‚Äù,2,"I really wanted to like this podcast. However, the recycled debunker rhetoric you spew in the Skinwalker Ranch episode about animal mutilations makes me question your knowledge of these subjects in general. It makes me question your motivation as well. Why do a podcast about something exciting just to complain and say it‚Äôs not actually that exciting? Why take something sexy and shroud it in boring? I‚Äôm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. Read Stalking the Herd by Christopher O‚ÄôBrien. Then tell your listeners that mutes are nothing and farmers can‚Äôt properly identify decay and scavenger activity. I guess it comes down to this: If you‚Äôre not an experiencer, you have no business making judgments. Cover what you know. Or at the least, read a book that gives the topic fair consideration.
Sorry for the low rating but this is a capital offense amongst experiencers, uninformed debunking that ignores the compelling points. I would‚Äôve given only one star but I bumped it up to two because there is a female co-host who says smart and thoughtful things.
I understand there are annoying components of the paranormal fan community who say ridiculous things. But to liberally dismiss the stories of hundreds of thousands of others is not a rational response to these ‚ÄúStar Children‚Äù. üòÜ"
1670,MonsterTalk,Good but,3,It‚Äôs a fairly good show but too often they seem to assume that you know what they‚Äôre talking about. If you‚Äôre coming to this without a lot of background knowledge you may be lost.
1671,MonsterTalk,Fave,5,This is definitely my favorite podcast. For sure allllllll my people ‚ô•Ô∏è!
1672,MonsterTalk,Favorite evening treat,5,I always look forward to each new episode and re-listen to the old episodes at the end of the day. A great combination of lore and logic presented by presenters who appreciate both.
1673,MonsterTalk,Compelling,5,"I don‚Äôt typically leave reviews but seeing as this show occasionally collects a few bad ones for nothing more than offending a believer here and there I think it deserves a 5 star review. üòõ
The hosts and guests are all extremely thoughtful and this show combines two of my favorite things: skepticism and fantastic mystery. These folks bring with them a compelling toolkit you can use to challenge your own experiences with. One of the best applications of critical thinking with an entertaining and non-condescending spin."
1674,MonsterTalk,An incredibly enjoyable and increasingly educational podcast.,5,"When I first discovered podcasts several years ago, Monster Talk was one of the first I tried out. Most of those first podcasts (and many others since) did not hold my interest and were dropped by me in order to try out something else. Not Monster Talk though. There was never a point that I considered putting it aside for something else in the competition for my listening time. As they‚Äôve made their way through the usual menagerie of pop-culture critters and many of the more obscure variety, the guests and subject matter only seem to get more interesting and even more relevant to concerns in the real world as they‚Äôve begun to delve into historical human ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù. I love how they remain largely apolitical, but still put out content that is easily recognizable as applicable to current day world events, if you‚Äôre so inclined to notice the parallels..."
1675,MonsterTalk,"Interesting subject matter, not the best sound quality",3,"I love the subject matter and Blake‚Äôs commentary but I don‚Äôt find that Karen adds very much to the episodes and the two don‚Äôt have chemistry. Blake could really just do this on his own. The people they interview are interesting and this show has one of my favorite intros. I appreciate that when Blake interviews people with different views than his he is respectful of their opinions. I do wish they could improve the sound quality, though, most especially that of the people they interview. The hosts sound like they are speaking through tins cans and the interviews seem to be recorded through Skype or a similar manner so the sound quality is very, very poor. I often I can barely understand what they are saying because they all have high-pitch electronic interference. I don‚Äôt listen to this podcast as much as I used to specifically because of the sound issues. But, maybe they can upgrade their tech at some point, I‚Äôll be a subscriber again."
1676,MonsterTalk,Monsters!,5,"Taking everything I‚Äôve ever heard about concerning monsters and more, MonsterTalk makes it all entertaining again. I used to spend much time reading articles about and documentaries on cryptozoological creatures and the underlying skepticism of the shows hosts brings refreshing points of view to some old subjects and new ones about monsters I‚Äôm just learning about. The show is entertaining and sometimes funny. Listening to MonsterTalk is a great way to spend some time!"
1677,MonsterTalk,Favorite,5,"Literally one of my favorite podcast, I love monsters and the passion for them they show even as skeptics really shows and I love that."
1678,MonsterTalk,So much fun.,5,"I have listened to every episode. The level of research and opinion is stellar. Never a boring episode. Worth every second of your time. Jump in on an episode that sounds interesting to you. They've got werewolves, UFOs, bigfoot, ghosts, and tons of regional an historical things you may never heard of. Great work. Can't wait to hear what new things they cover."
1679,MonsterTalk,Have loved it for years,5,"I've listened for 6 years now, and have loved it.
Definitely go listen to the old episodes, they were fantastic! Well researched, intelligent.... and there are a lot of them. Djinn, Werewolves, Chupacabra, Hopkinsville, Grimoires, Spiritualism, Small Town Monsters, A. Crowley, Werewolves (and real wolves!) are some that I go back and listen to."
1680,ICU Rounds,Awesome podcast!,5,"I listened to ICU rounds 10 years ago as a nurse and started listening again now as a nurse practitioner starting an acute care NP program. The content is always relevant and up to date. Thank you for starting it back up! -4/2020
I am a critical care nurse in Texas and have found this podcast an excellent resource, and is great to listen to during my daily commute. Thank you for all hard work Dr. Guy! -2010"
1681,ICU Rounds,Cream of the crop,5,I‚Äôve been listening to these since I was a nursing student then as a RN and then CRNA school and now you‚Äôre back!!! Downloading both new episodes and going for a bike ride to learn about COVID critical care! Please keep recording!
1682,ICU Rounds,Listened to every epo,5,Im a nurse anesthesia student and former icu nurse. Listened to everyone of his episodes. I simply cant recommend these more! So much learning in a relaxed atmosphere
1683,ICU Rounds,I‚Äôm the most excited,5,Good to have you back.
1684,ICU Rounds,You‚Äôre back and it‚Äôs fantastic!!!!,5,"Dr. Guy, you were a wealth of information for me as an undergraduate nurse. I would listen to your episodes while running, driving, cleaning the house. I gained a really good foundational understanding about IVF, shock, lactic acidosis, trouble shooting ET cuff leaks, pulmonary wedge pressures, central lines and ventilator management. I learned so so much! I took all that information to my senior practicum in the PICU and wow‚Äôd my preceptors and myself.
Now over 5 years later, I‚Äôm in graduate school learning to be an NP in pediatric acute care. It was such a pleasure to open my podcast app today to find you‚Äôre back.
Thank you immensely!"
1685,ICU Rounds,Welcome back,5,Very happy to have you back.
1686,ICU Rounds,Welcome back!,5,So glad to have you back Dr. Guy!!
1687,ICU Rounds,Welcome back!,5,"Great update. Nice to have you back, the information you put out is incredible helpful! Keep it up."
1688,ICU Rounds,Glad you are back,5,Glad you are back
1689,ICU Rounds,Love!,5,I really loved these but where did they go?!? Come back!!!!
1690,ICU Rounds,Where's Jeffery?!,5,I loved these podcasts! Where have you gone Jeff? Come back and make some more podcasts.
1691,ICU Rounds,LOVE IT!,5,I LOVE this podcast--It has gotten to the point that it is the only thing I want to listen to while I am in the car--extremely informative.
1692,ICU Rounds,Med/Peds,5,"Excellent podcast. Great evidence based practical knowledge. Love the way he explains it down to a cellular level, but in a way that is applicable to day to day clinical care."
1693,ICU Rounds,"Very accessible, but also very accurate",5,"I'm a virologist, not a clinician. I got hooked on Dr. Guy's podcasts while doing some molecular scutwork, and I've been hooked for the last several hours. Our lab has been hooked, and it's a great way to bridge my (research) background with some more clinical applications. I really appreciate the in-depth descriptions of not just what to do, but WHY. Very nice."
1694,ICU Rounds,crna,5,HANDS DOWN the very best podcast for brushing up on critical care pathophysiology from a clinical application standpoint. no other podcast even comes close. im a crna who covers an icu during nights every other week/weekend.
1695,ICU Rounds,Awesome,5,Such an awesome review that you can take everywhere. I would recommend these podcasts for all training in any field of medicine! It is easy to take on-the-go.
1696,ICU Rounds,Makes me wish I went to Vanderbilt,5,This is without a doubt the best medical podcast I have ever come across.
1697,ICU Rounds,Amazing,5,I have listened and re-listened to these lectures throughout my last 2 years of medical school. These are easy to listen to and to follow. I wish Dr. Guy was still doing these!
1698,ICU Rounds,Thank you,5,This has been a great resource throughout school. I appreciate all of the hard work you have done doc!
1699,ICU Rounds,Excellent Resource,5,"If you have a quest for continuing your studies on the field of medicine this podcast is for you. So much relevant information is conveyed through Dr. Guy, that you are guaranteed to leave each podcast with a new view on a case or condition. I highly recommend this podcast to anyone in the critical care or emergency medicine field."
1700,ICU Rounds,Awesome!,5,"I am a Student Registered Nurse Anesthetist, absolutely love this podcast. Information is presented in an easy to understand fashion, perfect for any health professional who wants to learn something new or brush up on existing knowledge. Highly recommended!"
1701,ICU Rounds,Great podcast,5,I'm an intern in Internal Medicine currently rotating through the ICU department. You've helped me greatly in understanding the concepts! I began listening however when I was on the medical floor so your concise and easy to follow podcasts has boosted my knowledge in all areas as well. Most of the time it gets hectic to learn everything so having this podcast to pick up what I've missed is really nice. Thanks!!
1702,ICU Rounds,Love this podcast!,5,"I'm not sure what happened to Dr. Guy, but I love these podcasts! I've learned so much from him. My fingers are crossed someday he'll resume this endeavor and release new content!"
1703,ICU Rounds,Albumin,3,"There is NO research that shows albumin is worth a dam. It‚Äôs expensive, a blood product that has its own issues. If albumin did what you state it could be titrated for urine output. Lasix with albumin proves only lasix works, a trial would have to be done to if either or both work.
There are many IV fluids that can be given for volume expansion that are cheaper and work.
ATLS, ACLS recommends good fluids for volume use that are cheaper and safe.
There can be very narrow reasons to us albumin but volume expansion is not one of them."
1704,ICU Rounds,Where is Dr. Guy?!,5,Great teacher and want to hear more about current literature!
1705,ICU Rounds,Great podcast,5,Great lecturer. Interesting. Relevant.
1706,ICU Rounds,BEST EVER,5,"This guy got me through paramedic school at the top of my class with the ‚Äúpharmacology for prehospital providers‚Äù book.... I listened to his podcasts during my 2 hour trip to and from class. I loved reading the book, but was amazed by his podcasts!!!!"
1707,ICU Rounds,Amazing and still relevant,5,"Ever since my first taste of the ICU environment I‚Äôve been looking to expand my knowledge. This podcast is THE ultimate talkie from one expert who was also the associate professor at a university medical school. Unfortunately, it cuts off at 2012 and I‚Äôve found no hide nor hare from him ever since. Everyone knows that critical care medicine changes rapidly and you have to keep up with it. But this podcast serves as one of the best launching points due to his evaluative and entertaining analysis as well as his empathetic views on colleagues such as nurses and pharmacists. Definitely one of my faves. If anyone knows where I can subscribe to anything else this man has done please let me know!"
1708,ICU Rounds,Amazing!,5,I love these podcasts and learned so much from all of them. What an amazing teacher.
1709,ICU Rounds,Please do some more shows,5,"Dr. Guy, I think we can all agree we need you to do some 2018-2019 podcasts!! We miss your great teachings. I want to know updates on the topics you‚Äôve already covered and more."
1710,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Awesome podcast,5,"To all the people that love to criticize, it's easy for you to criticize, but it's much more difficult to contribute..."
1711,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",I like Dr. Livingston's voice.,5,"The new narrator (who was actually on a prior podcast episode), Dr. Livingston, is nice.
That said, I agree with @flyingpoodle's review, it does make it slightly harder to follow, but if you're multi-tasking it tends to break up the segments a bit so you know. The intro of external guest voices in mid-sentence (... ""an article titled..."") was a bit jarring, more appropriate for, say, a narrator reading a children's storybook to children when a character's voice suddenly appears in the middle of a sentence. Sometimes news radio lead-ins will hand it off as stating a one-sentence summary or lead, and then introducing the next speaker. From a production value standpoint, with external guests, it's odd that they're recording an inbound phone call as opposed to asking the authors to record a Voice Memo on an iPhone or use any more modern high-quality call platform.
The back stretch of the most recent podcast in the new format is all Dr. Livingston, though, and it's nice.
While I don't dislike Howard Bauchner's voice from prior episodes, I do happen to work in New York -- so not all listeners across the country may be used to his sort of voice. Also, I admit I liked Ed Livingston's voice better, in both intonation and pacing. Like some others, I miss Dr. DeAngelis, but wow, the comments section is all over the place for prior podcast versions featuring her voice!
Most recently, the JAMA podcast did away with the cute, quirky intro theme that sounded like a 2010-era iPhone ringtone. The intro theme is now replaced with stock B-roll audio that sounds like we're about to watch an HR training video. While this sounds more ""professional"", there are probably newer ways of adding audio bumpers to signal the start, transitions, and end of the podcast, and something that's unique to JAMA as opposed to a generic library of stock audio.
The broader issue is one of the structure of medical scientific content. We are accustomed to a predictable format -- intro, methods, results, discussion -- that reveals the ""so what?"" at the end, with titles that tease the question but don't reveal the answer. In audio & news-bulletin type summaries, the emphasis may be more on the ""so what?"", potentially even inverting the format of abstracts.
To each their own, I suppose. Remember how JAMA used to have cover art? Listeners may vary in their appreciation of the artistic & stylistic aspects of the Podcast, versus cold, sterile and relentless ""just the facts"" formats.
But overall, this is a great and high-impact podcast and regardless of the stylistic elements -- the art here is getting the style elements done in a way that helps readers remember the content better. Comments sections will attract nit-pickers (like me), but most likely the vast majority of listeners to the JAMA Editors' Summary are quietly thankful and satisfied."
1712,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.","Great summaries, old format better.",5,"I prefer a single voice throughout the podcast, I can understand the appeal to some of having authors speak about their articles, but it makes it harder for me to follow. I like your podcast because of the single voice format, not in spite of it."
1713,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.","Good, short summary of recent research",4,"I'm a first year medical student trying to get an introduction to current research. This is a very approachable, quick and easy way to see what is going on. I disagree with negative comments about the host. He is great, and is very appropriate for th medium, being the editor in chief of JAMA."
1714,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Recent narrators even worse than DeAngelis,3,"I sort of liked Dr DeAngelis's podcast readings, not a professional voice but clear and understandable and sometimes humorous. Since she left the newer narrators are much worse, not at all enjoyable or entertaining. Annals of Internal Medicine podcast also used to be great and now stinks due to lousy readers. Both journals need to get someone better!"
1715,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Needs Editing,1,"Regading the podcast for Vol 307, No. 2: The podcast sounds like it was recorded in brief 30 second segments and at least 2 repeat making the podcast sound like a broken record."
1716,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.","Good journal, bad podcast",1,"It's a good journa; great articles and excellent popular interest pieces. Absolutely terrible narration. It's distractingly bad. I haven't listened in a year and really wish I could. Wish it were more like the Annals podcast; fun narration, interviews, etc"
1717,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Needs a lot of work,1,"Pod cast little more than a reading of abstracts and titles of articles, not much help. Look at NEJM as an example of a useful podcast - summaries most of the articles nicely so I can select the few I really need to read completely. And if your going to to a short podcast, I think spending 10% of your time discussing a painting I can't really see on my ipod is a waste of time."
1718,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Not the Right Person for the Job,2,"Just tuned in this week for the first time, so very disappointed to hear at the end of the podcast that the editor intends to continue as the reader/personality. I found it grating; humor that falls completely flat, and a singsong reading style that just doesn't convey meaning very well. I see others like the podcast, so perhaps it's a matter of taste. I will say she sounds like a very nice person. For a more professional, entertaining, information-rich equivalent, try the Johns Hopkins Podmed (relevant, informative), or the Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast (interviews, clear article summaries, and very funny humor)."
1719,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Too sing-songy a voice,2,I had to stop listening.
1720,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",very interesting and entertaining,5,Dr. DeAngelis explains and summarizes the complicated cutting-edge research articles by putting articles into a broader context to general science listeners. She is also very entertaining to listen to! It's a perfect example of what a educational podcast should be.
1721,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Dropping the ball,2,"Dr. De Angelis should put down the mic and let someone with real speaking skills do the job of podcasting. JAMA is an important journal and her cute, homey style is not appropriate. She lacks both presentation and organization skills. (For example, doesn't bother to correctly pronounce names of authors and places and she fails to include an upfront listing of each episode's contents.) This is all very inconsiderate of the listener and and creates a sloppy, stream-of-conciousness feeling to the work. There are very good examples of quality medical/science podcasting and JAMA is failing to make the grade. JAMA has the content, but the delivery is horrible."
1722,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Disagree with Al,5,"I've listened to the podcast and quite frankly I am a bit surprised by the idea that the good doctor is not right to voice this program. Podcasts are not meant to be professional in most cases and therein is the beauty of them. What makes Dr. D. qualified to speak is that she is the Editor-in-chief and not that she has a NPR quality voice! Get real, Al. I personally do enjoy her presentations as they are done by her, though it might also be good to do an interview concerning a most important article as mentioned. Great podcast."
1723,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Fluff,1,"Just a bunch of B.S. the more I hear, the more I believe the pharm industry is writing this stuff."
1724,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",DiAngelis rocks,5,I love her dry wit. She kills me...and makes the pocast great! I wasn't expecting it to be so entertaining!
1725,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Yuck. Gotta agree with Al.,3,"Her commentary isn't cute. She made a Hooters joke. Seriously this journal is too prestigious for her to be reading it. It doesn't sound professional.
Even if she was hilarious, they should hire a reader."
1726,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Refreshing Informative,5,"Its nice to hear these summaries & commentaries. I like Dr D's voice & her manner. She is not dry or boring, like so many medical lectures. Ever fall asleep in Grand Rounds with a speaker that drones on & on? At least this speaker keeps your mind from wandering AND presents important information."
1727,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Dr. D is a hoot,5,"It is funny to hear her repeatedly butcher the pronunciation of ""cannabis"" and other words. Overall, the podcast is good for what it is -- a quick survey of each week's JAMA contents."
1728,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",Too technical for the layman,1,"I understand that JAMA's audience is medically-inclined. But some of us laity have an interest in health and medical news and it would be nice if JAMA could produce a ""consumer"" podcast that summarizes the latest week's issue IN PLAIN ENGLISH. If AMA is going to spend millions of dollars pumping out stories for television stations across the country to poach, the least they could do is a consumer podcast.
One star only because I cannot rate it zero stars."
1729,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",good info but too boring,2,"This journal is full of great info, but I found this podcast difficult to remain focused. It could be presented in a more entertaining way."
1730,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",great stuff!,5,I appreciate that Dr. DeAngelis takes the time to make this podcast both informative and entertaining. You definitely won't fall asleep listening to her! Excellent work and hope to see more podcasts from JAMA in the future.
1731,"JAMA Editors' Summary: On research in medicine, science, & clinical practice. For physicians, researchers, & clinicians.",not my fav,2,"The operative term is annoying. I used to read JAMA religiously, I pick and choose now. I keep hoping the podcast will be more informative and less preachy. Also, the inane prattling on about the cover artwork has got to end. JAMA is supposed to be about medicine. An article synopsis would be nice."
1732,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Much diminished,2,"Back when this was hosted by Alok Jah, it was my fave podcast. Ian Sample is good but apparently not considered for taking over. Instead they‚Äôve added a couple of poorly spoken girls‚Äîyes they present as girls, not women‚Äî who do embarrassingly trite interviews. The whole thing has become fragmented and dull. I delete most of them these days. Now we are told that we shall have ‚Äúscience without the scientists‚Äù and just go about asking ‚Äúreal people‚Äù what they think! Ugh! I‚Äôm done‚ÄîDELETED."
1733,The Guardian's Science Weekly,"Once great, now has shady sponsors",1,"Just finished listening to the episode on coral reefs and was very disappointed to learn that Dominion Energy (which relies on fossil fuels) and Toyota (which is siding with tRump as he guts fuel efficiency standards) are sponsoring the podcast. I thought The Guardian was a leader in informing the world on the climate crisis. With sponsors like these, how can we trust its content on climate?"
1734,The Guardian's Science Weekly,B12 is NOT folic acid,1,The episode ‚ÄúAre alternative meats the key to a healthier life and planet‚Äù has an egregious error stated by presenter. She says ‚Äúvitamin B12 is also known as folate or folic acid ‚Äú This is not true. Folate and Folic Acid are different forms of B9. Cobalamin is the alternative name for B12. This could have dangerous consequences because a listener might take folic acid thinking they are preventing B12 deficiency. You must correct this episode or remove it.
1735,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Quality,4,"Pacing is good, thoroughy enjoyable for those topics you already have an interest in."
1736,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Great science for the layman,5,My favorite podcast for keeping up with what's new in science. It is presented in a way that is thorough and also accessible to the layman.
1737,The Guardian's Science Weekly,"So happy ""A neuroscientist explains"" is over with. The old Science Weekly is back!",4,"I didn't realize it, but since Trump got sworn in Science Weekly decided to experiment with a series called ""A neuroscientist explains"" with Dr Glaser and Max Sanderson; it was a disaster. Oh my god, I didn't realize how much it drained me until I heard one of the older episodes with Ian Sample, Nicola Davis, or Hannah Devlin. I unsubscribed because of the experiment: it just wasn't engaging as topics on materials, cosmology, climate change, or the Concorde. I think Dr. Glaser's voice put me to sleep and Mr. Sanderson sounded juvenile.
Now it looks like SW is returning to the old format, and I've subscribed again. No longer will I feel drowsy at the gym! SW team, please don't fix what isn't broke. You're the only science podcast I love since here in the US we have NPR's Science Friday with Ira Flatow (whose delivery I cannot stand)."
1738,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Long time listener unsubscribes,1,A once superb podcast has degenerated into a trendy mush of cutesy sound effects and editing that has resulted in distracting and boring this listener. So sad that content has taken a back seat. Each thirty minutes has about fifteen minutes of substance now. Please stop trying to be the TED radio hour and I might come back.
1739,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Really Annoying,2,"This should be an excellent podcast but the presenter is so conceited that he just can't help interrupting the narrative with his boasting. It's a major distraction and ruins the whole thing.
He keeps pointing out that he's a ""neuropsychologist"" (as opposed to what, a dermal psychologist..?)
and interrupts often with his opinions.
There are much better ones out there. I've deleted it."
1740,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Great podcast. Absolutely worth it!,5,It's a great podcast. I really enjoy it. I wish I could mark it down to 4.5 because sometimes the audio quality suffers at the recording time. But I'm not going to rate lower because content is so good.
1741,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Best science podcast,4,This is my favorite science podcast.
1742,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Consistently Excellent,5,"Funny, informative, insightful. Great supplement to the online/print edition."
1743,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Fantastic!,5,How is it possible that more people aren't raving about the podcast?!
1744,The Guardian's Science Weekly,Very Informative,5,"This is a great podcast for those looking to stay informed on the latest science news. The overviews helps keep track of what is changing, and the depth helps understand why the news is important (or not important.) Keep up the good work. Cheers from the Midwest of America."
1745,The Guardian's Science Weekly,one of the best science podcasts out in cyberspace,5,"This and NPR Science Friday and BBC's science in action-is EXCELLENT- some of the best in depth interviews and you don't have to have a science degree - I use their information for teaching high school
and overall inspiration-KEEP up the good work!"

1747,The Guardian's Science Weekly,What you didn't know you wanted to know!,5,My favorite Podcast. There is a ton of interesting information presented in an easy to understand way. The hosts are entertaining but do nto get in the way of the information. Perfect balance.

1754,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,Great resource,5,Have a 50 minute commute each way to work and this has been an amazing way to try and keep up to date
1755,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,Awesome Podcast!!!,5,"Matthew, Stuart & Paul, hosts of The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast, highlights all aspects of health, wellness and more in this can‚Äôt miss podcast! The hosts and expert guests offer insightful advice and information that is helpful to anyone that listens!"
1756,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,You don't have to be a physician to cull tons of value!,5,"I am a nurse care manager. I began listening to The Curbsiders as I recently took a job in Ambulatory Care. My background was Medical Surgical and Psychiatry floor nursing - yeah I know - not something you usually see. Nonetheless, I work in two family medicine clinics. The information I have obtained has been invaluable! I have been able to ask more well-formed questions discuss current treatment practices on a variety of issues with our prescribing clinicians. I also have a tremendous amount of insight to provide to my patients beyond my own clinical experience. This podcast is chock full of super useful content. For physicians, several episodes may provide CMEs as well. (I kind of wish it did for nurses too). Either way, I have hacked my own 45 minute commute by listening to podcasts, and this one makes me such a better nurse! I am proud to share your information with the physicians and nurse practitioners I work with. Your episodes on Diabetes, Women's Cardiac Health and X-waivers, in particular has changed how people practice in Arkansas - in a good way. There are always pearls to be had.
Now, while they may tell you to skip the first several minutes of the podcast - I will tell you why you shouldn't. Firstly, Matt, Stuart and Paul (and others) are true gems. Getting to know the personalities of the hosts as well as the personal lives of the guests is invaluable in my opinion. I love Matt, though I think he is the nicest boy next door. I love Stewart for his spectrum perspective (it is amazing and illustrative of why we need so many kinds of people to make the world go round) and Paul - Paul's self depricating humor and snark are unmatched in any ""Clean Lyrics"" podcast. He's for sure my favorite. I love the hosts. I love the staff on the show and I love the content I love the people. This podcast is amazing."

Practical/useful stuff. I literally apply something from each episode into my daily practice. I love the youthful energy and enjoy the book recommendations also. The CME is very efficient and links directly with ACP and ABIM.
1759,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,Curbsiders,5,"I am a Nurse Practitioner of Internal Medicine in Austin, Tx and have learned so much from you guys and this podcast.

Inconvenient,"

It is the synthesis of the scientific basis of medicine, the practical pearls that come with mastery, and the humanist perspective that drives providers to care.

Good use of your valuable time."
1763,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,General review,3,"The part if the podcasts in which the guest experts discuss the cases and make teaching points, along with the take home points towards the end, have been very interesting and informative. However, the first ten minutes of each podcast have been boring and irrelevant. When I can, using the time stamps in the show notes, I fast forward to the ‚Äúmeat‚Äù of the presentation. I don‚Äôt care about the book and movie reviews and find them a frustrating waste of time when I am unable to fast forward (I mostly listen when driving.)
Finally, the outro is also annoying and juvenile. ‚ÄúFood for your brain hole‚Äù?...‚ÄùYummy‚Äù? Very adolescent along with ‚ÄúI have been Dr. so and so‚Äù and ‚ÄúI remain Dr. so and so‚Äù. Why can‚Äôt you just close as an adult with ‚ÄúI am Dr. Matt Watto‚Äù?"
1764,The Curbsiders Internal Medicine Podcast | MedEd | FOAMed | Internist | Hospitalist | Primary Care | Family Medicine,Excellent clinical podcast,5,"As a FNP that works in addiction medicine and psychiatry and also provides primary care services to patients in residential treatment, this podcast is amazing!

However, it would be great to get to the point sooner rather than later. It takes a while to get to the meat of the topic. I am sure there is quite a bit of chemistry between the hosts, but can we keep that resulting banter down to a minimum, or spread it out or put it to the end ?"

1806,The Science of Success,Best In-depth Interviews of Experts & Top Performers,4,"Matt is a brilliant interviewer! I greatly appreciate how much research he does on every person and topic, along with crafting engaging and interesting questions.
The reason for four stars: the recent changes in ads. They don't seem to fit the podcast at all, there is no transition music, and it's no longer Matt's voice."
1807,The Science of Success,Information Overload...in a great way!,5,"Matt's excellent interviewing skills make listening a pleasure. The key points are discussed and when it benefits the conversation, he digs deeper to enhance and clarify the topic.

1813,Open Minds UFO Radio,"I Miss You, Alejandro",5,"Was it something I said? Something I did?
This is still the best UFO/UAP discussion podcast, and it‚Äôs been six months since any new content was produced.
Alejandro Rojas takes such a smart position on the topics. They‚Äôre fun to talk about, but let‚Äôs keep it grounded. He stays on the ground, and it makes for a really smart listen.
Do yourself a favor and start as far back as is still hosted, and listen to them all. They‚Äôre all good."
1814,Open Minds UFO Radio,Where are you Alex?,5,I really enjoy this podcast. I wish they would make some new episodes?
1815,Open Minds UFO Radio,The best of the best vanished,5,Alejandro T Rojas!!!!!! Where are you? We miss the show. Please come back.
1816,Open Minds UFO Radio,Come back!,5,Alejandro! Come back! Come back!
1817,Open Minds UFO Radio,"Great Podcast, But No New Episodes",5,"Another podcast I found late, where they‚Äôre apparently not making any new episodes. Their YouTube channel went dark six months ago too. Come back, Alejandro! We need more episodes! Hope everything is ok."
1818,Open Minds UFO Radio,Where are you?,5,Did you get abducted by aliens?
1819,Open Minds UFO Radio,Great show. Informed host.,5,"I like this show a lot, but I'm a latecomer. I just discovered it a few days ago and I hope Alejandro makes some new podcasts."
1820,Open Minds UFO Radio,Is it off ?,5,Did they take this show off ? It was awesome!!!!!!! Please bring it BACK!!!!
1821,Open Minds UFO Radio,Takes itself too seriously,1,"This is a podcast about ufo‚Äôs, not a documentary on the Smithsonian channel. Needs quicker pacing and much more and better humor."
1822,Open Minds UFO Radio,Hope the show returns.,5,"Good show, I hope it returns. Is the host in I‚Äôll health?"
1823,Open Minds UFO Radio,Great Collection,4,"This is a fun, sincere podcast. These pods do not settle into a realm of ‚ÄúUFOS ARE HERE!‚Äù But rather explores conversations about what could be in an inquisitive manner."
1824,Open Minds UFO Radio,One of the best,5,"Far above many other UFO shows, solid, funny, smart and always stoked for a new episode."
1825,Open Minds UFO Radio,"Big fan, fellow truth seeker.",5,"I LOVE this podcast!
I‚Äôm the type of person who‚Äôs gone through every documentary/ video/ picture about ufos, extraterrestrials, and the paranormal, that I can get my hands on.(many with a mention to this podcasts creator!) I‚Äôve had many sightings and sent about 10% of those into the mufon site itself.
This podcast puts a lot of that information into the mouth of MUFON familiar Alejandro Rojas, it‚Äôs great to hear experienced and educated perspectives from the man himself! Not to mention the insight on new movies and shows that involve strange weirdness as well, which is always VERY welcome information in my book.
I also want to point out that Caleb Hanks intro music puts me in the best mood! ( more info on him please) I put it on full volume when I start the show, which is also when I start work. Safe to say, my coworkers are slowly becoming fans too! One day I forgot to start my podcast, as I was in a couple minutes late and felt rushed. My coworker sitting next to my desk eagerly asked when I was turning the podcast on. Can‚Äôt wait to hear more.

1828,Open Minds UFO Radio,Great Podcast!,5,"Always interesting, intelligent, friendly, and factual. Not a bunch of unsubstantiated speculation."
1829,Open Minds UFO Radio,Stop typing during your interviews!,3,"I enjoy listening to Open Minds but on many occasions when he has interviews I feel he doesn't give his guest his full attention. He always seems distracted and I realized on his last few podcass you can hear him typing notes....either get a soft keyboard or just listen to your own show after for reference. Other than that, the show is pretty good."
1830,Open Minds UFO Radio,The Best Ufology Coverage,5,Alejandro is a ufologist who is very strict on his journalism ethics. I truly appreciate this much needed level of integrity in this topic. He gets a lot of interesting guests on his show. And he is a great interviewer. Just a professional.
1831,Open Minds UFO Radio,Absolutely love but ...,5,Wish the show kept a regular schedule.
1832,Open Minds UFO Radio,Love the podcast- are you coming back?,5,"Love the weekly pod cast and I miss it. Are you finished making it?

1834,Open Minds UFO Radio,Professional show,5,I really enjoy and appreciate the production that Alejandro has put into this show. It flows just right. He also definitely has covered all the heavy hitters on the topic. He has a comfort level with his guest that helps them not feel attacked. That is good and bad in my opinion. I also have noticed his change of opinion on several past guest and I appreciate that. It shows that he isn‚Äôt a stalwart out of pride on his past comments. I do really enjoy the show ! I appreciate your hard work Al!! Please continue!!! Crabby
1835,Open Minds UFO Radio,Sorry for the 1 Starüò¨,3,"My apologies for the 1 Star rating. I have to say I like the content of this podcast, however I found it to be too inconsistent for my liking ( this is just a personal opinion).
I haven‚Äôt given up just yet and the 1 Star can easily be changed accordingly. Keep up the good work guys!!"
1836,Open Minds UFO Radio,From 5 to maybe 3.,3,"Long time listener, observer. They listen to what suits them. Mostly like everyone else. But the clickiness and mafia esqu√© tactics of some fans and politics turn half of your audience off."
1837,Open Minds UFO Radio,Ughhh,2,"Your voices literally put me to sleep!
Such interesting topics lost through such boring story telling. Ughhh"
1838,Open Minds UFO Radio,Awesome!,5,Really enjoy this one. Alejandro is a good interviewer and the show is really well done. Get DeLonge on!
1839,Open Minds UFO Radio,Thank you and keep it up!,5,I Really enjoy listening to this podcast. Alejandro comes across as a kind and sincere person that gives respect to his guests and is genuinely interested in the topics. He has a voice that is easy to listen to and the production quality is good! I have been listening to these different podcasts almost daily! One of my favorite interviews thus far has been Sean Cahill. I enjoyed the topic and I liked listening to him a lot. He is a sincere individual with a lot of intelligent insights that I really enjoy! Thank you for doing this podcast. ‚ú®
1840,Open Minds UFO Radio,The best except for Martin,5,This is the Gold Standard for this field. Shame on me for taking years to leave feedback. Alejandro and Martin‚Äôs chemistry is endearing and makes the show fun and infectious.
1841,Open Minds UFO Radio,Great!,5,"I really dig this podcast. In fact I was expecting to be a couple thousand reviews it‚Äôs so good. Anybody that is remotely in to ufo stuff you have to give this a try. I haven‚Äôt found a good ufo podcast yet. Until this one. I am in to the paranormal in general ghosts, ufo‚Äôs and all that kinda stuff. He has a lot of good guests on like nick pope, many others as well just can‚Äôt remember how to spell their names. That‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt believe it didn‚Äôt have as many reviews it‚Äôs just that good. It sounds like a professional produced show. If you listen and didn‚Äôt leave a review get on it. He deserves many good reviews. I am saying you should really give a listen if you haven‚Äôt. Very well done definitely subscribing to this one. You should to. No I don‚Äôt know the guy and this is a genuine review. Can‚Äôt afford to support him with money. So this is the next best thing."
1842,Open Minds UFO Radio,Production quality makes it unlistenable.,1,All i can hear is someone smashing the keys on their keyboard. So poorly put together.
1843,Sasquatch Chronicles,Thumbs up.,5,Good stuff.
1844,Sasquatch Chronicles,Question,5,Love love the show been listening for a couple years now and I‚Äôve decided to take the plunge to become a member... I use a podcast platform on my iPhone and I am not seeing an obvious way to become a member... help please!
1845,Sasquatch Chronicles,My üíñFavoriteüíñ-Simply The Best Podcast,5,"I love Sasquatch Chronicles. I even got my hubby listening to it. I started listening with the soonest episode & worked down. I had NO IDEA that at the beginning there used to be a few other regular ‚Äúhosts‚Äù(not including Woody, Woody is great). The man named Will would completely would talk over Wes & the guests THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING WILL OFF THE SHOW, he interrupted EVERYONE! AND JUST WANTED TO TOOT HIS OWN HORN! - I‚Äôm so glad that the Podcast was simplified and Wes became the primary host, that was the best decision for the podcast. Wes deserves a raise for all the bs he puts up with. Keep up the good work."
1846,Sasquatch Chronicles,A lot of haters,5,"This show is simply amazing. Anyone who could say Bigfoot doesn‚Äôt exist is simply looking to go against common sense.
That seems to be a common theme in this country today.
Wes has created a forum that so perfectly captures these experiences that are so much more common than we believe.
I think he knew he was onto something. But you could really tell when he went solo.
Absolutely listen!
You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
1847,Sasquatch Chronicles,Big food don‚Äôt exist,4,Even though Bigfoot don‚Äôt exist I like the host and the stories!
1848,Sasquatch Chronicles,Good Host,5,Wes handles his guests well and with great dignity. He understands how to let them talk and not interrupt. I appreciate his style greatly.
1849,Sasquatch Chronicles,Love him!,5,I was ecstatic when I found Wes and his amazing podcast! My immediate coworkers always know lunch break means podcast time in the car and I am always asked what Bigfoot did today. Thank you for all you do and just being awesome.
1850,Sasquatch Chronicles,The show,5,All I can say is I love the show. I like the way you let people come and just tell they stories and not be judged. Keep up the good work Gus
1851,Sasquatch Chronicles,BOBO,5,Thanks BOBO you‚Äôve brought some comedy back to the Bigfoot world.
1852,Sasquatch Chronicles,Bobo,5,Loved the Bobo interviews. Very impressed with his knowledge and great attitude. Nice job!
1853,Sasquatch Chronicles,Best show out there!!,5,I listen to Wes almost every day. I‚Äôve never seen one but I get that feeling in certain areas of Appalachia. I do have to say Mr Merkel comes in a close 2nd. You guys really help me get through some rough stuff. Keep the shoes coming!
1854,Sasquatch Chronicles,Never disappointed,5,My go to podcast to escape for a little bit.
1855,Sasquatch Chronicles,Disappointed,1,I love Bigfoot and stories of Bigfoot so I turned this on to get a break from COVID-19 talk. The first 10 minutes of the show was all talk about Coronavirus. I turned it off.
1856,Sasquatch Chronicles,Commencement speech,5,"Hi, I‚Äôm curious who was giving the 1990 commencement speech at the end of your episode tonight."
1857,Sasquatch Chronicles,Best Sasquatch podcast out there,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to Sasquatch Chronicles for quite a while and just realized I never did write a review. (Sorry Wes) I think this is the best Sasquatch podcast out there became Wes has such a relaxing style. He gives the guest the time to tell his or her story freely, only asking questions for clarification or extra details when needed. This helps the guest feel at ease to share their experience naturally. Even if you aren‚Äôt sure Sasquatch is real, you will enjoy the stories, and gain a new perspective."
1858,Sasquatch Chronicles,Skeptic first time listener 2020,5,So I was turned on to this podcast by my cousin this year. I have always had a curiosity about Sasquatch. And I am listening starting at the beginning. Just want to say the casualness of y‚Äôall talking and taking calls and your basic scientific knowledge you‚Äôre applying really is commendable. It really comes down to common sense. And an east Texan myself this posd cast has made me reevaluate things I‚Äôve seen and heard as a kid. At the very least has made me more cautious going out into the woods. Thanks guys really really am enjoying this!
1859,Sasquatch Chronicles,Listening since 2014,5,Best Sasquatch podcast keep up the good work!!!üëçüèΩbeen a squatcher since 2012.
1860,Sasquatch Chronicles,Big Thanks,5,"Enjoy the show since beginning, usually don‚Äôt write reviews, but I am so proud to hear you going the extra mile. People do need to help one another at a time like this and the extra shows will help so many people who need a great helpful distraction. Thank you again!!!!"
1861,Sasquatch Chronicles,My Go To Podcast,5,Been listening since 2015‚ÄìWes your podcast has led me down quite the spiritual rabbit hole. In the best way. Loved Bobo! Bring him back!
1862,Sasquatch Chronicles,Awesome,5,"Love the show, want to buy West a beer for what he puts on. Thanks"
1863,Sasquatch Chronicles,Ep 632 BoBo,5,"BoBo coming with some insane stories.
Really comes across as a amazing person."
1864,Sasquatch Chronicles,Bring him back!!!!!!!,5,Please bring back Bob Garrett. !!!!!!!!!!!!
1865,Sasquatch Chronicles,I‚Äôm hearing clicks in the woods...,5,"...when I go out in the night to walk my dog. One click when I leave the steps and then a click when I get back to the steps. My dog always has her head down and will not go far from the house. Sometimes three clicks from different locations around me. Only in Jan-Feb. Every year. Some may say wood knock but it sounds more like a deep click from the mouth. Two years ago, this podcast made me finally pay attention to the sound I‚Äôve heard for years in the winter. Creeped out from remote Alaska."
1866,Sasquatch Chronicles,Sasquatch Chronicles Rocks!,5,"This is by the best Bigfoot and other things paranormal show out there! Wes cares about his listeners and always delivers a most compelling show. From the moment I started listening I was hooked. Love it!!! Thanks, Wes!!"
1867,Sasquatch Chronicles,Love the New Intro,5,"Been listening about two years. Just listened to the new intro. I love the music, it is up to date with sounds, love the listener intro. Keep up the great work, Wes."
1868,Sasquatch Chronicles,Gold Standard,5,This show is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù by which I measure all other paranormal podcasts. Thank you Wes.
1869,Sasquatch Chronicles,Third guy,5,I was listening to some older episodes like the one where we‚Äôd and his brother go through their encounter and I have to say thank god that third guy is gone.kept interrupting their story to ask his stupid questions like that‚Äôs more important.shut up and let them talk.so much better he‚Äôs long gone
1870,Sasquatch Chronicles,"Heavy on Dogma, But Also on Good Content",4,"I‚Äôve been listening to this a lot, lately. The host has a great way of putting people at their ease and opening up. You can‚Äôt hear so many convicted people tell such incredible tales and not wonder what is happening out there. I feel I have to mention the Bible banging devoteeism of many of the guests gets a little absurd. Many admit to basing their research and belief solely on the Bible...which is sadly indicative of a blind adherence to opinion not science fact...and it gets too heavy to ignore. Perhaps if the country weren‚Äôt in the shape it is, I‚Äôd be able to smile and let it pass, but it gets a bit overbearing. If you can get past that, there‚Äôs a lot of good stuff here."
1871,Sasquatch Chronicles,Ep. 624,5,Awesome interview! Very interesting episode.
1872,Sasquatch Chronicles,Best podcast,5,"I‚Äôve always loved this podcast and Wes, especially since he‚Äôs a Kansas City Chiefs fan. We don‚Äôt have a lot of Sasquatch in Kansas but we have a huge Super Bowl win!!!!"
1873,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Updates,5,"Hi I‚Äôm a respiratory therapist from upstate Ny, I love this podcast, I know you guys are super busy out there. Just please please keep educating us with this horrible virus and share with us what is working out there. I learn so much from you guys and it keeps me curious to keep on learning. Please please help us out here. Thanks for all that you do!!!"

1875,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Great refresher,5,An absolute amazing refresher for this FM physician who was suddenly in over his head during the COVID19 outbreak.
1876,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Unbelievably useful.,5,"Unbelievably useful podcast. Astounding insight on what actually works, why it does work, and how to put that knowledge to use without further ado. Hands down the best podcast in the field."
1877,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Concise and practical,5,"ED iNurse or - no longer provide ER nursing but identify more as an ED nurse rather than the other nursing or pre-hospital care in which I served patients. Currently serving veterans, the greatest patient population on earth. Any patient who asks if you have something better when you tell them they need to stop using crack is a patient that is willing to be educated. Compared to the ED (where time to eat, drink, poop or pee is a luxury of a rare shift despite mindless, out of touch leaders beliefs of healthcare providers playing cards all shift), I have a comfy cosy job of caring for the pre, intra and post GI procedure patients. But I enjoy hearing EMCrit saying all the nice things that good ED, pre-hospital and post ED care providers have been thinking all along - at least those with uncommon sense and think rationally for person we are determining the best short and long term outcome. Thank you for your podcast!"
1878,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,IM resident fan,5,"IM resident, not in ED/CC, but still listen to this in my car to and from the hospital. Probably my favorite source of educational material, this guy is awesome. I dont even write reviews but came here to write this."

1880,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Who rate this podcast as 4 star? What the hell,5,My never met mentor.
1881,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Seek education!,5,"Ed nurse here, I love this podcast. I work in a rural hospital with a busy ED, this podcast gives supplemental and pertinent information that has both improved the care I provide and helped me grow as a nurse. Relatable to many levels of health care providers, in many different fields and departments.
Have also seen much of this podcast implemented at work... even joking with my coworkers saying ‚ÄúScott Winegart here‚Äù when suggesting something I learned on this podcast. Always gets a good laugh... because we ALL listen to this. üëçüèº
Thank you Scott! Keep it up, I love this stuff!"
1882,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Love these!!!!!!,5,This is my favorite podcast!!! Please do a follow up for the 246!!!
1883,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,The best critical care podcast,5,"I've always been a huge fan of Dr. Weingart and his ability to explain advanced topics in a very straight forward way. The procedure videos on his website are also awesome, and are how I learned how to perform central lines independently. Highly recommend the podcast and to check out the website as well."
1884,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,One of the best medical podcasts on the internet,5,The way Dr. Weingart delivers complicated information in a concise and easy to understand manner on this podcast is nothing short of remarkable. He and his podcast and an excellent resource for many in medicine.
1885,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Highly recommend!!,5,"Amazing topics, very concise. Covers both cutting edge topics and the not so glamorous ones we all try to dodge that are integral to practice while keeping things interesting."
1886,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Fantastic,5,Change my career and allowed me to transition to EM full time w confidence!!
1887,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Best EM/critical care podcast out there,5,"If you are in the healthcare field at all there is something you can take away from this podcast. As a prehospital provider it definitely has had a positive impact on my education, decision making, and patient care."
1888,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Essential listening for critical care practitioners.,5,"Great podcast! I was fortunate to save a life because of what I learned from listening (emergency cric after listening and watching videos here, and after ""the day I didn't use ultrasound"" lecture). Thanks Scott!!"
1889,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Essential to stay up on clinical critical care,5,Use info from this podcast in my day to day practice constantly.
1890,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Scott is my hero!,5,Love love love this podcast. I'm a flight and ER Paramedic. Sometimes I know more about current treatments than some of the ER docs because of the information learned here. Thanks and keep it up!
1891,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Former Physiology Professor 2 Thumbs Up,5,"As a former physiology teacher of medical students, who then decided to go back to medical school, I say without hesitation that this is the most helpful, engaging, and accurate (as least from a physiology perspective) podcast I have ever listened to. Simply a beautiful job."
1892,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Real Deal,5,This is such a great podcast. Dr Weingart is very down to earth despite being very bright. Makes ER accessible and has real life application of the theory. He also introduces you to other great minds and resources in the biz. Worth every minute.
1893,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Fascinating!,5,Love this podcast. Just love it.
1894,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,No words.,5,"As a Paramedic you always strive to do better and most importantly improve your patient outcome. These podcast might seem above our scope but provide a better understanding of why we treat, help improve our initial care, and most of all help with assessments."
1895,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Best medical podcast ever,5,Have been a listener for many many years. incredibly informative. I find myself listening to older episodes because they are so good and dense with material. Thanks for making me a stronger clinician!
1896,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,FNP,5,"I‚Äôve been listening for about a year. Man, incredible info at the forefront of ever changing medicine with straight facts, honest opinions , witty humor, and mindful training- you can‚Äôt find better. Ive been listening to emrap, urgentcarerap, pedsrap, primarycarerap, curbsiders, uptodate etc for several years and by all means they are terrific, but somehow I always retain what Scott Weingart preaches. A wealth of knowledge for any provider acute or outpatient. I‚Äôm a firm believer in ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know‚Äù so freakin‚Äô learn it! You want regret your time with these podcasts...Ever"
1897,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Great information,5,Enjoy podcast
1898,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Long Time Fan,5,There's always something to listen to on a commute from EMCrit/PulmCrit. Very relevant to me as a Flight Nurse and Acute Care NP student. Keep up the great work and thanks for all you do Scott!
1899,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Excellent emergency medical podcast!,5,"Excellent, up-to-date, ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù, emergency medical information. One of my favorite emergency medical podcasts. Keep up the good work!!"

1902,EMCrit Podcast - Critical Care and Resuscitation,Love this,5,Have been listening now for a couple years and I love this podcast! I learn something new every time I listen and it is apparent that Dr. Weingart has a real passion for both critical care and teaching. Keep up the good work.
1903,Emergency Medicine Cases,US PA listener,5,My patients benefit from the time I spend listening. I can talk shop with the physicians I work with as a colleague and often get to share some pearls with them. Great approach(es) for learning and reinforcing. I have 3 main sources for my ongoing educations and this is the only one that is free. And it‚Äôs just as important.
1904,Emergency Medicine Cases,Best ED Podcast,5,"I listen to several ED medicine podcasts. This is the best. For a 1 hr listen, it is an easy listen. Focused, educational, and organized. I‚Äôm telling everyone about this podcast."
1905,Emergency Medicine Cases,Love!,5,"Educational, fast, to the point, great sound, and great topics. Finish feeing well informed and better equipped."
1906,Emergency Medicine Cases,All I listen to,5,"I‚Äôm either listening to EMcases or Curbsiders on my commute to the office. Love all the knowledge. Wish more of my colleagues would listen!
Could y‚Äôall do a podcast on antibiotic prescription for practices on common things and the data that obliterates using Abx for bronchitis and ‚Äúsore throat‚Äù. Would love to tell my colleagues to go listen."
1907,Emergency Medicine Cases,Chest Pain,5,The best sound system of all medical podcasts - I can hear it in the shower!
1908,Emergency Medicine Cases,Best EM podcast,5,"Lots of programs out there‚Äî this one is free, does not feel the need to constantly play jingles or radio skits interrupting the dense material‚Äîand it‚Äôs fantastically organized by a host that does not trip over his own feet and engages the well curated guest experts allowing them to concisely and plainly and thoroughly discuss each topic‚Äîwithout interrupting the podcasts flow to hear his own voice or add his two cents.
Excellent host, excellent production.
CR, FACEP"
1909,Emergency Medicine Cases,Best FOAMed Podcast,5,"I have listened to over 30 different medical education podcasts (free and paid), and EM Cases has been far and away the most enlightening."
1910,Emergency Medicine Cases,Outstanding,5,Outstanding. ED doc.
1911,Emergency Medicine Cases,Just incredible,5,"As Trauma and ER nurse in a insanely busy trauma center I cannot praise this podcast enough. It covers a wide variety of emergency medicine and has some excellent pearls which I have taken and used in my practice. I‚Äôm constantly getting asked where I gain my clinical knowledge from and I often refer colleagues to this podcast as it is easier than researching independently! Information is clear, concise and is presented in a way that is applicable to the bedside. And it is always backed up my recent research which I love!"
1912,Emergency Medicine Cases,Great EM pod,5,Really liked the Quick Hits episode!
1913,Emergency Medicine Cases,Intelligent and enjoyable,5,"Once again, the Canadians do a fabulous job at communicating medicinal tactics and interventions clearly, logically, and with superb intelligence. 5 stars!"
1914,Emergency Medicine Cases,Love these things.,5,Awesome episodes and love the personal experiences.
1915,Emergency Medicine Cases,"MD, PhD",5,"Absolutely Great!
Not only for EM docs, also very helpfull for IM, Surgery and a lot of other disciplines."
1916,Emergency Medicine Cases,Wonderful!,5,"Unscripted-yet-structured and informative, Dr Helman is engaging and a superb educator. Really great guests too. Only thing that could improve is sound quality."
1917,Emergency Medicine Cases,Best overall medicine podcast out there,5,"Absolutely love this podcast! The complete and comprehensive overview of each topic makes this unique from other podcasts,and absolute must listen for anyone in emergency or critical care"
1918,Emergency Medicine Cases,The best emergency medicine podcast,5,"Very educational and well run podcast. Well done, keep up the good work. I listen to a lot of ED podcasts and this is among the best. Good tunes as well."
1919,Emergency Medicine Cases,Phenomenal,5,"I simply love it. Every episode is a gem. Extremely well laid out questions/ conversations/ recaps. Gets into the real life issues/ thoughts that even seasoned physicians could learn a great deal from.
My favorite among a land of high quality medical podcasts."
1920,Emergency Medicine Cases,Great podcast to learn/brush up on!,5,As a PA student looking to go into EM this podcast is so helpful! Walking through case studies and discussing various presentations and treatments options are exactly what I was looking for. Definitely a must subscribe for anyone in or looking to go into EM.
1921,Emergency Medicine Cases,fabulous!,5,"Great discussions of important topics in critical care. And Not only for ER staff.
Thank you for wonderful presentation! Love your podcast!"
1922,Emergency Medicine Cases,Think of public health results,2,"Overall, they need to get a handle on public health and the realities of the policies they're trying to put in place *in addition to the emergency treatment*. Episode 74- on opioids- drives that home. Hard. They see black. They see white. Nothing in between. What really shocks me is knowing how smart Reuben Strayer is when it comes to ketamine but has such a huge blind spot when it comes to opiates. So sad. .... One more thing- the weak ""crazy"" sound effects. They aren't strong enough to have an impression but just kind of a noise."
1923,Emergency Medicine Cases,Really helpful,5,"They cover everything from core content to the newest updates, and presented in a case format that makes it easier to remember. Keep up the good work, and thanks!"
1924,Emergency Medicine Cases,I'm loving this,5,"The journal jam was the episode that finally convinced me to write this review. I am new to EM podcasts so I can't say how this rates against others, but it's just what I've been missing. Concise topic reviews that keep you engaged and have NOT been watered down to homeopathic concentrations! In short it's a well done podcast which, after listening to each episode, makes me feel empowered on the topic discussed."
1925,Emergency Medicine Cases,Incredible!,5,"Interesting, educational, and very enjoyable!"
1926,Emergency Medicine Cases,Really interesting!,5,I enjoy the presentation and the wide variety of topics addressed. My only gripe is the odd video game-esque sound effects used for transitions. They're rather startling.
1927,Emergency Medicine Cases,So much fun for a layperson,5,"I'm not in medicine but have always had an interest. This podcast makes the field so approachable and interesting -- I've learned so much. Don't be scared off if you're a layperson because I guarantee you'll have an interesting time!! The guests are great. I especially like how Dr. Helman breaks down the interviews into sections. I also get super excited when there is a new Best Case Ever & the new members of the team have been doing a great job. It's great to learn so much while learning the background context by osmosis as well. I recommend asking Siri to define a word if you don't undrstand. Anyways, thanks for this podcast!"
1928,Emergency Medicine Cases,Fantastic topics with fantastic experts and fantastic evidence,5,Favorite medical podcast out there. So well done. I especially enjoy the mid-podcast ‚Äúrecaps‚Äù to reinforce the information. Keep up the good work!
1929,Emergency Medicine Cases,Great podcast !,5,Guy has a nice voice and explains very well and makes it really interesting !
1930,Emergency Medicine Cases,ER nurse,5,"As an new ER nurse I find this podcast to be very helpful! I‚Äôve learned quick, yet efficient approaches to preforming my assessments and ask questions."
1931,Emergency Medicine Cases,So insightful!,5,"I‚Äôm just a patient care tech, but I‚Äôm an avid learner and am perpetually curious. This podcast lends so much understanding into the world of physicians, and what I can do to be more compassionate as a team player. Thank you!"
1932,Emergency Medicine Cases,Awesome!,5,"I am a general practitioner who has been on a hiatus for a couple of years and this podcast is a great way to refresh my knowledge and keep me updated, thank you! However lately I have been unable to play any episode, when I attempt to I get an error message ‚Äúepisode is temporarily unavailable‚Äù even when I went to your site, the audio couldn‚Äôt be played, I wonder what‚Äôs the issue?"
1933,Science for the People,Is there ANY more necessary podcast right now?,5,"Listen: we're in weird times right now, and science education really seems to be lacking real-world science application and science literacy. I'm not a particularly science-brained person, so I *need* this podcast to explain how things actually work, and why I should care a lot more than I already do. Please keep up the hard work!"
1934,Science for the People,The best podcast bar-none,5,"I listen to a lot of different podcasts, but because this one has become such a favorite recently I was stunned to see it only had 125 ratings in the Apple podcasts app.
Simply put, this is the best science related podcast there is. Look no further- there is no other podcast that has such detailed discussion of modern scientific research.
Sure, the long format can be a drag if the topic isn‚Äôt of interest for you- you can skip over them- but for those 80 or 90% of episodes that do touch on something you‚Äôre interested in or don‚Äôt know about- the conversational format and the host‚Äôs uncanny ability to ask fantastic, knowledgable questions make this the delight it is.
The host Desiree is a scientist as well and really knows how to get highly specialized researchers to relate their work to everyday people and issues, without dumbing down the discussion or becoming dogmatic, and there‚Äôs just no one else doing that.
Thanks for your show and please never go away!"
1935,Science for the People,"Addictive! Fun, understandable, and relatable",5,"I have listened to every single episode of Science for the People. I love how the hosts make science a simple and geeky conversation, making science and scientists themselves more approachable and understandable to your every day listener. Science for the People is my favorite podcast of all time!"
1936,Science for the People,so good,5,"absolutely one of my favorite podcasts. they do a good job at one of their stated goals: giving scientists a space to talk in depth about what matters to them. the hosts are funny and kind, and they always make the show engaging. I love to listen to this on my commute :)"
1937,Science for the People,A definite favorite,5,"I've been listening to this podcast for over a year, and it's become one of my all time favorites. I love the wide range of topics, all discussed in an interesting, accessible manner. Thanks!"
1938,Science for the People,Long-time favorite,5,Science for the people offers a balanced perspective of important scientific topics with good sound quality and quality reporting. Thank the cosmos for Canadians.
1939,Science for the People,Love it!,5,This is by far my favorite science podcast. Very good interviews that ask insightful questions. Does a great job of making the topics understandable without over-simplifying.
1940,Science for the People,Great!,5,Don't miss an episode.
1941,Science for the People,Just what I was looking for - thank you!,5,This podcast provides science content in a readily digestible format to keep me informed.
1942,Science for the People,Outstanding show,5,Great interviews and content.
1943,Science for the People,This podcast has become worthy of 5 stars--here's why,5,"The host is a good speaker and asked good questions. The guests on the show are top-notch scientists and other educators promoting science and critical thinking. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the fact that people can contact the show in real time and have a chance of getting their questions addressed on the show separates this podcast from some other skeptical podcasts. The intro music was upgraded recently and the lyrics to the song are all scientific skepticism--science and logic. The outro music was dropped--good decision--nobody listens to those anyway. Listen to this podcast so you can get the skeptical point of view and maybe learn something about Canada too."
1944,Science for the People,World Class Skeptical Broadcasting,5,"The professionalism and insight displayed by Deseree Schell and her cohorts places this podcast at the top of my weekly podlist. She is one of the rising stars in the rational-thought movement. There has yet to be an episode where she has not both made me laugh and taught me something new. ""Skeptically Speaking,"" along with ""Point of Inquiry"" and ""For Good Reason,"" help to arm skeptics with information we need in a woo-filled world. Highly recommended."
1945,Science for the People,You must subscribe,5,"A must for skeptics, science buffs and people that like to learn new things."
1946,Science for the People,Not much here...,2,Incredulity about any subject makes your bias an impediment.
1947,Science for the People,A refreshing change from other skeptical podcasts,5,"I can't say enough good about this podcast. While most skepticism podcasts tend to be rather dry (dare I say ""boring""?) and are hosted by people who occasionally try (unsucessfully) to be funny, Skeptically Speaking actually puts out a podcast that takes an approach toward subjects that is serious without being self-important. It's not easy to take a lighthearted approach that still pushes out valuable information, but Desiree Schell and company do it with seeming ease. With a different guest each week, the listener is spared the standard host-talking-for-an-hour format (although Desiree could read the greater Chicago phone book and I would probably listen)."
1948,Science for the People,"Enjoyable podcast for long drives, or working out/walking",5,"One of my favorite podcasts. The host, Desiree Schell has gotten better with each episode. New listeners should start with recent episodes like GM food, Science of Sleep, Fear, to appreciate the great conversation. If you are a fan of engaging talk radio, you will enjoy this show that focuses on science topics. I appreciate the fact that the host offers her audience a great deal of time asking questions. And also, I appreciate that the guest is always given sufficient time to convey a point (there's no interrupting here - unlike talk shows on television). Download the podcast and go for a walk - you'll be exercising both your body and your mind!"
1949,Science for the People,Easily one of the best science podcasts available.,5,"The host does an excellent job of getting top guests in their fields of science and she does a great job of coaxing their knowledge from them in a way the average person can understand. I am always impressed with the preparation the host has obviously put in before her podcasts. The professionalism shines through.
The GMO foods show, the obesity show, and the UFO show are favorites of mine."
1950,Science for the People,"I like this show, and I have the evidence to prove it.",5,"My evidence. Every time I listen, I find myself smiling. Desiree always seems to be having fun exploring serious and seriously interesting issues in skepticism and science. A must listen for anyone wanting to enjoy an hour of critical thinking."
1951,Science for the People,Love From America,5,"I learn so much from the variety of guests interviewed. Topics like gender and race are usually not covered by skeptic podcasts, and I love the balance between hard science, politics, and social issues. The Speaking Up segments and the occasional traveling shows (like from DragonCon and TAM) are great too. I would like it if Desiree would push her guests to actually answer her questions when they go off on a tangent. This doesn't happen all the time, but when it does I get very annoyed. Desiree has a great radio voice and has a fantastic personality. I appreciate having a skeptical show that encourages listener input. Well Done Edmonton! Where's my California version?"
1952,Science for the People,A Good Hour of Smartness!,5,"These shows can be difficult to pull off! I don't sympathize with other commenters who perceive some lag in the format. Tightening-up of the product is inevitable...given enough time and encouragement great shows like this will have a loyal listenership and might challenge the ""big boys""!"
1953,Science for the People,EHHHHHHXCELLENT!!!,5,This podcast is a great find for me. I've been looking for another skeptic podcast I could put in my regular rotation and this one fits the bill - thank goodness because some of the others I've tried failed to hold my interest or were so badly produced I couldn't bear them. I'm a huge fan of SGU but find that this podcast covers topics in greater depth and interviews with the experts are thorough and thought provoking. Great job!!
1954,Science for the People,Wrong on so many subjects,1,So bias towards mainstream medicine it's ridiculous ! Hope you get any help you ever need from mainstream but I doubt it.
1955,Science for the People,"Interesting topics, interviews, excellent skills by Desiree Schell",5,"I suppose my title says it all. Skeptically Speaking engages guests on interesting and cutting edge topics. Desiree Schell has excellent interviews skills, making even the guests who are not necessarily good radio material (as some scientists are not) seem engaging. The show airs live and questions can be tweeted, emailed, and chatted in for guests.
Not all guests are scientists. Guests are invited from many different backgrounds, including activists and entertainers.
Overall, I recommend this podcast to anybody who is interested in skepticism. It is not a ""strong"" podcast as some can be, but rather engaging."
1956,Science for the People,Always excellent,5,"I look forward to SS - it rarely disappoints with interesting and varied topics, a great host (Desiree) and guests that really know what they're talking about. The theme song is pretty cool too!"
1957,Science for the People,Good podcast. Bad theme music.,3,"I would love this podcast if it were not for the ""nails on chalkboard"" horribleness they call a theme song."
1958,Science for the People,Great stuff,5,Informative -
1959,Science for the People,Always Interesting and Very Inclusive,5,"The program has guests each week that are smart, engaging, and well-spoken. Host Desiree Schell explains or has guests explain the basics of each topic, so each episode is accessable to anyone. Desiree and the rest of the on-air team are clearly genuinely interested in their guests and topics, and it shows in the quality of discussion. I also appreciate the amount of humor and laughter on the show, to keep it from getting stuffy. And since it's a live, call-in radio show, listeners have an opportunity each week to be involved in the conversation.
More than anything, this is a great introduction to the ""Skeptic Community."" Many episodes have suggestions for events, websites, books, resources, and ways to get involved in Canada and in the US, and Desiree and the guests always seem warm and inviting."

I listened to every single episode during my commute to my rural family medicine rotation (I'm a MS3). I felt it provided me with a framework for how to think through problems, great acroynms to make things easier to remember, and also a way to make sure as a medical student, I don't miss the big things. The show notes are also clear and concise. I have recommended this podcast to many fellow students."
1991,EM Basic,New PA,5,"I used this podcast during my emergency medicine rotation and found it really helpful for my exam. Now that I am starting to practice EM, it is even better. Dr Carroll provides a better level of relevent detail for approaching a complaint than my other review materials which were more focused on buzz words. His explanations are practical and easy to understand."
1992,EM Basic,So helpful!,5,"I recommend EM Basic to all my new nurses in the ER to help them better understand procedures they may assist with and the rationale behind different orders they may see. Really clear, useful explanations!"
1993,Science... sort of,"Entertaining, but‚Ä¶",4,"This podcast is very entertaining. I have subscribed/unsubscribed multiple times over the years due to the fact that the hosts cannot keep politics out of the show. Unfortunately, podcasts are my escape to/from reality and are simply consumed by me to unwind. Politics invade almost every aspect of my life and I do not need any in my entertainment. Other than my personal whine, the show is very good, the hosts are entertaining and the guests are often outstanding. Wishing the Brachiolope Media Network much luck and love!
P.S., I‚Äôm currently unsubscribed but listening‚Ä¶"
1994,Science... sort of,Stop reading this and subscribe,5,"If you clicked on this podcast you obviously want science and it‚Äôs got all those good bits you want with none of the bad. It‚Äôs funny, smart, and down to Earth while being very digestible for every kind of person."

As an Environmental Bio major, this podcast makes me want to go out and continue to learn more about the world and all the interesting things it has to offer!
Thanks for the inspiration!"
1996,Science... sort of,I‚Äôm (science) sort of Obsessed with the show,5,"I‚Äôve always loved science and I love to learn! I currently am not in the position to pursue any college at the moment, but I still want to learn scientific stuff! If you‚Äôre in my position, this show is PERFECT for you! I can‚Äôt stress how much I‚Äôve learned! There are 100‚Äôs of different topics that they talk about on this show, and they ALSO explain it so regular, wanna-be scientists (like me) can understand the topics without having extensive knowledge of the article or topic!
Give it a listen. You won‚Äôt regret it."
1997,Science... sort of,Science.... Sorta.... Rocks,5,"This podcast is absolutely brilliant.. I love their banter, interviews and unique subject matters!!!

1998,Science... sort of,Talk nerdy to me...,5,"This is my go to podcast for long drives. I am a science nerd and I love the entertaining, humorous, and pithy conversations about all things science and sort of science. It is great when you can learn about newly discovered parasites, the feasibility of super hero powers, and the history of beer all in one place. The hosts are awesome and the tone makes you wish that you really could just be hanging out at a bar with all these super cool and nerdy people. Speaking of bars, I just had a Deschutes Marionberry & Lavender Sour Ale and it was crisp, unique, and delicious."
1999,Science... sort of,Brilliant!,5,"This podcast is fantastic. It encourages the listener to explore scientific topics and challenges them to learn exciting new concepts every day. Ryan is a great host bringing talented guests on the show, never a dull moment.

Living in the Chicago area, we were able to do a class field trip to the Thornton Quarry to hunt for fossils. I have also had the chance to also go hunting to the Mason Creek fossil beds. Finding a Tully Monster fossil is my Holy Grail. Keep doing a great job!"
2002,Science... sort of,Just started,5,"I just started from the beginning and I‚Äôm about 18 episodes in.

I now listen on a daily basis, they talk about interesting topics in science and I feel I learn something new every time I tune in."
2003,The Social Work Podcast,Like the show,3,"Hello, I am a social worker in Michigan, and I like the show. It has been helpful in various ways for lots of projects and professional dillemas. My issue is a lack of feminist theory, focus of people of color, specifically working with African Americans in the US, and shows on working with men. There is so much to discuss in this area that is unsupported in the mainstream, and is being perpetuated on podcasts and any media stream. Let‚Äôs hear about how to work with cultural, race and gender issues in this patriarchal structure we are all thrown into."
2004,The Social Work Podcast,Quality is here,5,Dr. Singer has a ‚Äúwarm while informed‚Äù approach to every interview and the experts he engages in this podcast.

He‚Äôs curious and thoughtful about how social workers approach social work and how they delve into issues, scratching beneath the surface to really educate listeners - social workers and lay people alike. If you‚Äôre studying or considering a career in this field - this podcast is like a grad level course on therapy, practice, and social justice. Also love the podcast Social Work Talks, in which NASW tackles social work current events."

2009,The Social Work Podcast,Thought provoking content!,5,"Thank you for covering a variety of topics. I have referred my MSW students to this podcast.

You will find yourself referring back to some podcasts again and again. I‚Äôve also made little cheat sheet reminders on some of the content presented during these podcasts (you know those things that you just want to keep on top of your mind). Highly recommend for professionals and students as well as professionals from similar-like professions to social work!"
2024,The Social Work Podcast,"Education, Entertaining, and Empowering",5,"As a current BSW student, this podcast has and continues to educate me on a plethora of Social Work content.

There is something here for you. I was the aspiring new graduate testing for a license. Listening to easily 30+ episodes in a short amount of weeks really assisted in taking all the academic knowledge and synthesizing it to practical use.

2085,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,My favorite podcast and radio show!,5,"I grew up listening to Quirks and Quarks on the radio. I moved to the US a few years ago, and was delighted to discover that I could still get my fix via podcast."
2086,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,Best Science Show that I Know Of,5,"I have been a subscriber to ""Quirks and Quarks"" longer than any other podcast because it is so interesting and well-done. I am a scientist, so I appreciate the approach that Bob McDonald takes in interviewing scientists. I appreciate that he talks directly to the researchers and that he does an excellent job in asking just the right questions to get to the heart of a matter and make any topic understandable by anyone who is interested enough to be listening. I highly recommend it."
2087,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,Layperson's fave,5,"This podcast is the best way to keep abreast of science news - always delivered with delightful insight. The world, curiouser and curiouser, unfolds."
2088,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,Great show and never miss an episode,5,Keep up the great work! I love your smart and interesting show. I always la earn something new from every episode.
2089,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,Great show!,5,I love it
2090,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,A Jewel,5,"I listen to 10 science oriented podcasts weekly and Q&Q is one I never miss. The host is pleasant to listen to, I think he's the Canadian Scott Simon. I seldom think a segment is not interesting. I particulary think that it does a good job with environmental issues and how they relate to people's lives. This one, The Science Show on Australia's RN and Science Friday are the crown jewels of magazine type science podcasts. The common element is that all three have long time hosts."
2091,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,"Accessible, Interesting and fun",5,Bob McDonald has the ability to make science topics understandable and fun to listen to. Quirks and Quarks presents the latest research that's relevant to all our lives. Just great.
2092,Quirks and Quarks Complete Show from CBC Radio,Learn something!,5,"Always relevant, always informative and always entertaining."
2093,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Recommend technical improvements,2,I would suggest recruiting someone or a few hosts with a ‚Äúvoice for radio/podcast‚Äù and provide them with technical support akin to the standards of public radio to deliver the weekly message. This would unburden the editorial staff of that duty and bring the aural experience of the listener close to level of what the printed product provides.
2094,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Poor audio quality,3,"Excellent information, but the audio quality is poor"
2095,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Only the first minute plays then skips to the next,1,"I tried to listen on apple podcasts and then also from annals.org but every time I get to the same spot about a minute and a half in it stops and starts playing the next podcast. Not sure what is going on, but think I would like this podcast from what I have heard so far, would like to figure out how to get the rest..."
2096,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,"Information good, episodes won‚Äôt play completely",2,"Almost every episode ends abruptly, and I am unable to fast-forward last a certain point... it continues to go to next episode. For example June 18 episode goes immediately to the next episode at the 7:55 minute mark. Pleas repair this."
2097,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Disappointed,2,"Poor audio, monotonic and several of the episodes are cut off. The content is good, but certainly needs to be presentes in a different way, and by a different person! Too bad really. Was expecting more."
2098,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Bring back Berkwitz,1,"The newest narrators as of summer 2011-12 are nowhere near as good as Dr Berkwitz used to be. Used to be 5 stars, now 2-3 is generous And as noted by others volume is way too low. Addendum: Better as of 2015 but still not as good as it used to be. Also --both March 2015 issues have been unable to be downloaded! Boo, ACP, Boo."
2099,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,No competition - best available.,5,iPhone tip: when gets into boring areas activate Siri and say ‚Äúskip ahead 1 minute‚Äù. (You have to use Apple‚Äôs podcast.app for this to work). Being able to skip through less interesting bits hands-free is very helpful when commuting.
2100,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Low production quality,2,"Note all the 5-star reviews are from 2009?! This sounds like it was recorded in a stairwell, and the unfortunate reader sounds like she is dealing with a lot of mucus. I find it hard to tell what she is saying. I'm sorry, but I won't be listening."
2101,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Not what it use to be,2,"Of all the similar pod casts that I have tried, the Annals provides the most information with the most enjoyable format that keeps me coming back the most times.
Update: I first rated Mar 8. 2009. since mid 2011 the quality of the podcast has plummeted. After giving the new editor time to develop her style, she has failed to provide the same podcast development. It is now just a verbal regurgitation of the various abstracts for the particular edition."
2102,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Agree with others.,3,Please bring Berkwitz back.
2103,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Best in Class,5,"I could not have designed a better podcast. Lively, fun (and funny), and you never know what you are going to get--and I mean that in a 100% postive way. Unlike other journal summaries, there are valuable interviews and supplements to the content in current issue. Not a dry read, and this is a ""show"" in the truest sense.
Keep up the great work Michael."
2104,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Excellent!,5,By far the best podcast from a medical journal that I have heard. Great way to stay updated on my commute. Plays like a NPR segment for internists and focuses on pertinent issues in GIM.
2105,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Great podcast,5,Without a doubt the best podcast based on a medical journal out there. Highly recommended.
2106,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Excellent job editing and summarizing relevant news,5,Thanks for taking the time to edit and narrate the weeks journal. It is a great in depth look at the feature article. The interviews are well done and commentary is relevant to the average primary care physician. I think this is one of the best medical podcasts available for primary care doctors.
2107,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Best Medical Podcast,5,"All of these reviews are correct: this is the best medical podcast there is.
One reviewer wrote that it has NPR-like production quality, and this is true. Michael Berkowitz could give Ira Glass a run for his money any day of the week. My one quibble would be with the reviewer who said s/he didn't like the musical interludes; they may be strange, but they manifest Berkowitz's brilliant and discerning musical taste. Keep it up!"
2108,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Absolutely Wonderful,5,Always clever and entertaining. A very engaging way to keep up to date on internal medicine. An incredible boon to any med student on a medicine rotation.
2109,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Best Medical Podcast,5,Wonderful interviews offer practice altering advice and updates. A great medical resource.
2110,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Good for Laypeople Too,5,"The journal summaries are for Docs only, but the interviews are excellent for all. The music/sound interludes are GREAT. Thanks to all those who produce this; very much appreciated."
2111,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Love it,5,"Best medicine podcast hands down. Easy to listen to, and fun! Excellent summaries, interviews thoughtful, music hilarious. Highly recommended."
2112,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Awesome,5,I'm an Emergency Physician and find your IM condensed podcasts invaluable to my specialty. Great work!
2113,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Best Medical Podcast to Date,5,"As an internist, I find that there is a lot of information streams out there. Between journals and shorter reviews (JournalWatch), email updates in the form of table of contents, my own pubmed searches, and podcasts, it is easy for an internist to be overwhelmed by both the information out there as well as the many ways of getting that information. The Annals podcast provides more than just a flip through the abstracts. Michael Berkowitz is an excellent interviewer and asks the questions that I am asking when I read the articles at home. In a short period of time, the time of my commute, I'm able to digest a journal and still remember its highlights months later. Thank you for providing more than what I could read on paper in the same amount of time."
2114,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Best medical podcast for physicians,5,"Extremely polished, engaging, and entertaining podcast. Michael Berkwits is a very credible interviewer and he does a great job with interacting with his guests. I like the mix of interviews and news, and even when he gives the brief summaries of the other articles, it never sounds like he is reading from a script. The musical interludes are usually droll and sometimes odd, but not unwelcome. In addition, the podcast is professionally produced with great sound quality and editing. Keep up the good work."
2115,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,it is great,5,Michael does a remarkable job summarizing the current state-of-the science in medicine. it is a pleasure to listen and i look forward to each new podcast.
2116,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Very Helpful,5,These podcasts are engaging and well thought out. I am a Family Physician and they are quite relevant for me.
2117,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Dr. Berkawitz is the best!!,5,"Thanks for all of the great podcasts. Interesting, knowledge building. Truely a wonderful source of information!!"
2118,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Where is Berkwits??,2,"This was my favorite podcast up to a few months ago. Dr. Berkwits was smart, funny and had wonderful medical interviews that added much to my knowledge. I loved the podcast and my only criticism was that it was once every two weeks rather than weekly. All that has changed when the current narrator provides a dry, inadequate summary of the journal. The best part of the previous podcast- the expert interview- which could have lasted up to 30 minutes or more, is now gone, and left the podcast with at the best a mediocre summary of the journal. Bring Dr. Berkwits back!!"
2119,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,New host is awful,3,I miss Berkawitz. Lane always sounds like she's drugged up and on the verge of crying. She also pronounces the names of pharmaceuticals in a way that makes me want to stab myself in the ear with a fork. Content-wise great podcast though.
2120,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,new presenter is absolutely awful!!!!!!!!,3,"Tottally flat and dry presentation. There is not spice in the podcast like before: no inteviews, medical trivia, etc.
I hope, they either bring Berkowitz back or bring in someone else who actually enjoys doing this podcast!!!!!"
2121,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,Berkwits????,5,"I've got to say that MIchael Berkwits presented a very unique podcast that included interviews, obscure music (I really miss that part), and thoughtfullness. Ms Laine unfortunately has very big shoes to fill. I'm giving it 5 stars up to summer 2011.
mike"
2122,Annals of Internal Medicine Podcast,hard to hear the great content,3,"Compared to other journal podcasts I listen to in the car, the volume on this podcast is too quiet and the audio production quality is not good."
2123,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Great review,5,This podcast has been the best I‚Äôve found to review topics I‚Äôve learned months ago (and mostly forgotten!). I love that I can exercise while listening. The fact that it‚Äôs easy to listen to and takes a ‚Äúquick and dirty‚Äù approach is perfect.
2124,Physician Assistant Exam Review,So frustrating,1,The information presented in this podcast is good. But it‚Äôs so irritating to have to listen to stories about the authors kids or wife or whatnot. Plus the study tips that I‚Äôm not interested in very much but I have to sit through to get to the questions . I would appreciate it so much more if he could do a podcast just going over topics for school.
2125,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Great way to review on SmartyPANCE,5,"Brian‚Äôs podcast is nicely integrated into SmartyPANCE platform and is also nice to have as a review podcast outside of this platform. The podcast is done in a format that is easy to follow and makes the learning process fun. I enjoy listening to this while working out or driving. Thank you, Brian!"
2126,Physician Assistant Exam Review,I passed!!!,5,"Brian thank you so for all of your encouragement, study tips, and explanation of the content! I credit your podcast in my success of both getting through P.A. school and passing the PANCE! It is because of you that I now have ‚Äúpance‚Äù to go with my white coatüòâ
~Dan"
2127,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Easy to follow along & to the point,5,I really enjoy listening to Brian. When I was in PA school I was always up for learning topics in various manners & he does a nice job giving his honest opinion. He lays out the important points & goes over those high yield topics. I definitely recommend this podcast during didactic and clinical year. I used them during my commutes to rotations. If you need the visual his website is great too. I also had the final step which was great to take along and even have a friend/family quiz me. I passed the PANCE 01/2020 and definitely recommend this podcast for studying and as a PA-C.
2128,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Physician assistant student,5,"THESE POD CASTS ARE AMAZING!! I‚Äôm currently in my clinical medicine class & listening to these podcasts are insanely helpful! It allows me to study while at the gym or in the car, instead of constantly having to stare at my computer screen or my printed notes! I really love how the podcasts are formatted, with the questions at the beginning, then the material in the middle, and then circling back around to answering the questions!"
2129,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Good for nurses too!!!,5,"I found this Podcast by accident while looking for review material in nursing school. In my 3rd semester we covered Psychiatric nursing and microbiology. The season one episodes that had been left up on iTunes just happened to coincide and the beginning of season two rolled right into OB/GYN which I start next semester. The rest of my cohort listened to the psychiatric podcasts before finals and we all found it very helpful. I highly recommend it for nursing students. The audio review is convenient for commutes, doing yard work and chores around the house and even walking the dog. Thank you!"
2130,Physician Assistant Exam Review,CALLING ALL NURSE PRACTITIONER STUDENTS,4,"I have been listening to this podcast for several weeks now. I know you are a PA and this podcast is directed more to the PA, but the study tips and content are applicable to nurse practitioner students tjat do not want to pay 100‚Äôs of dollars for a board review course. I have not been able to find anything like this for free specifically for NPs. Thank you for putting this content out. I really appreciate it. I am taking boards next week and because of this program I am confident about passing! One thing to point out is that one of my struggle categories is STDs. I found the material in different episodes but would be nice to have a podcast specifically for STDs!!
Thanks again for what you do!"
2131,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Love this podcast,5,"This has been the most helpful podcast I have found while going through FNP school. I use this to review at least weekly and the information is concise and repetitive, which is very helpful!"
2132,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Just what I needed!,5,So thankful for this review podcast! I‚Äôve learned so much while driving to rotations and it‚Äôs not been miserable to pack even more learning in the day. Thanks so much for your awesome content!
2133,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Wish I would have found this sooner!,5,"Finishing up my didactic phase of PA school and I really wish I would‚Äôve found these podcasts sooner! I listened to them on a long road trip and it was great! They are finely tuned to being centered for the PANCE/PANRE and do a great job of going over each topic. I have been listening to them each day while working out, walking the dog, or whenever I find some extra time! Highly recommend!!"
2134,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Love the pod but...,5,Love the podcast but Brian‚Äôs nervous/filler laugh is tough for me to listen to after months of listening now lol
2135,Physician Assistant Exam Review,LIFESAVER for long clinical site commutes,5,"This is by far one of the best podcasts to listen to when studying for the PANCE! I occasionally have long commutes to my rotations and I enjoy popping this on my radio. I‚Äôm about to take my PANCE in a month and I have been catching up on episodes. PA Wallace gives you pertinent, high yield information and also gives you other tips and tricks along the way. Can‚Äôt thank him enough for putting this together!"
2136,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Great for med school too!,4,"One of my favorite resources med school
Just be prepared to mash the skip forward button at the beginning and about halfway through each video to get to the good stuff."
2137,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Invaluable material,5,"This material is incredible. Straight to the point, removes all of the extra, confusing information on a topic and outlines the differences in diseases processes well. These podcasts single handedly prepared me to pass the PANCE 3 weeks after graduation. I can‚Äôt thank Brian Wallace enough for the time and energy he puts into this, it really is invaluable."
2138,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Perfect,5,"Just found out I passed the PANRE! Thanks again Brian
**(1 week ago) Just took the PANRE today and felt confident. Mostly because of the time spent listening to this podcast (listened to them ALL). It has been a life-saver while working full time and caring for 2 kids. The only other resources I used were the 2 practice exams from NCCPA (which give you feedback), and Davis‚Äôs PA Exam Review.
Brian, I can‚Äôt thank you enough for all the work you‚Äôve put into this invaluable resource. Keep it up!
-Tom Everts PA-C
Manitou Springs, CO"
2139,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Thank you,5,This follows the PANCE blueprint (and my didactic year studies) perfectly! Huge timesaver listening to these while driving/exercising instead of having to set aside more time in the day to read through old notes! Very organized and succinct. I definitely plan on listening to them all!
2140,Physician Assistant Exam Review,For Reviewing!,5,Perfect üëå I love this podcast. Thank you!
2141,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Great Resource,5,This review series is excellent for students and for those of us doing recertifications as well. PA Wallace does a great job of packaging information. I typically listen in the car and this is great.
2142,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Great podcast!,5,Listened to it everyday to and from work in preparation for my PANRE and it was totally worth it! Brian does a great job giving us what we need to pass and not wasting our time. PAs looking to prepare for their PANCE/PANRE would be foolish to pass this up. His website is also a valuable resource. Highly recommended!
2143,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Best PA Podcast!,5,"I just wanted to say that this has been the best podcast out there for a quick review for End of Rotation exams, especially during clinical year when my rotations are mostly 1 hour + drive. I love the quick recall and newer podcasts with review questions. I would love if you could add more podcasts for Pediatrics specific diseases, as this seems to be one of the topics that you have not covered as it is not that prevalent on the PANCE. Keep up the good work!"
2144,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Study on the move!,5,"I am in my clinical year and enjoy using this podcast as a tool to review during my car rides. It‚Äôs the perfect amount of information/time to get my mind moving and test my recall. I plan to continue using it as I finish up my clinical year and prepare for the PANCE. Can‚Äôt say enough about how helpful this podcast has been! Thanks for all that you do, Brian!"
2145,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Thank you!,5,"Hey Brian, I‚Äôve been listening to your podcasts now that I began rotations and I just wanted to tell you thank you. I drove 2-2.5 hours one way to my rotations and these have been so helpful since I spend a lot of time in the car everyday. I literally paused one session just to pray over you ‚Äî thank you for being such a blessing. I pray God bless you for blessing me and everyone out there who has benefited from you. I also be purchasing your book!
Best wishes,
Steph"
2146,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Thank you Brian!!,5,"This podcast has been so incredibly helpful for me during PA school! I usually listen to it while driving or exercising. The episodes are well organized, which makes it easy to follow and learn the content. Brian follows the PANCE blueprint, so it‚Äôs easy for me to find the exact episodes I need depending on what unit I‚Äôm studying. Thank you sooo much Brian! I‚Äôm always looking forward to the new episodes. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without your podcast!"
2147,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Thank you,5,"Not only is the exam review high-impact, but his study advice is great as well! Thanks to this podcast, my nerves were calm and my mind focused for the PANCE"
2148,Physician Assistant Exam Review,So helpful,5,Great review of topics. Perfect for driving to and from rotations!
2149,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Christin,5,Excellent podcast!! Bryan is really good at giving important information. Really helpful for EOR!
2150,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Must listen for PA students,5,"Listened to this on the car ride to school. He follows the PANCE blueprint, which aligned well with my didactic year curriculum. The short episodes helped me digest things in a short amount of time, but allowed multiple replays to help the info ‚Äústick‚Äù before an exam. Don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without this podcast in didactic year"
2151,Physician Assistant Exam Review,must listen,5,These podcasts are absolutely a life saver. I listen to them for my exams during school but will definitley relisten before my PANCE! Quick overview of important information and easy to listen to.
2152,Physician Assistant Exam Review,Super helpful podcast for PA students!,5,"This podcast has been so helpful for me during my didactic year. Brian Wallace does a great job being straightforward with the material, presenting it in a clear concise manner. I listen to the podcast to help me review for my clin med test during long drives or walks."
2153,5 live Science Podcast,great science podcast,5,great science podcast
2154,5 live Science Podcast,Great podcast! Love every episode of it.,5,Great podcast! Love every episode of it.
2155,5 live Science Podcast,Too many cheap jokes,2,"The moderator thinks that he is so funny, but he should keep most of the jokes to himself. The explanations by the experts are very interesting, but he keeps making stupid comments. It is ok to make a joke a two, three or may be four times during a program, but he must be doing like ten or more."
2156,5 live Science Podcast,Would give this 6 stars.,5,"Funny, smart, interesting, often sweet."
2157,5 live Science Podcast,"Always fun, never dull...",5,"Dr. Karl is always a fun listen. Unlike other science podcasts, it's never dull. His healthy skepticism cuts through the B.S., and with a sense of humor. His enthusiasm for knowledge is catching."
2158,5 live Science Podcast,Science at a personal level.,5,Dr Karl doesn't always get it right but he is often pretty close and always entertaining.
2159,5 live Science Podcast,The best,5,Who wouldn't want to spend an hour or so listening to Dr Karl?
2160,5 live Science Podcast,Make Yourself Smarter!,5,"Doctor Karl doesn't know everything, and he is openly willing to admit that. If he doesn't know the answer to a question he says just that, so you can be assured that he isn't simply making answers up! I also really like the way that Dr. Karl and the host ""Dr."" Rod interact with each other and the callers-- very professional and fun at the same time. I listen to every podcast Dr. Karl releases (also check out his podcast from triple J)"
2161,5 live Science Podcast,Dr Karl and the Naked Scientists? HEAVEN!,5,"I've been looking for more stuff on Dr Karl, since the JJJ weekly show for 1 hour just isnt enough. Bring on the Dr Karl tangent - you never know what you might learn. With these scientists uniting, you know this podcast will be great!"
2162,5 live Science Podcast,Informative and funny,5,"This is my favorite Brit podcast. We the Americans should really learn from Dr. Karl's program and the rest of BBC podcast programs re: how to make the program informative, honest and funny. Awesome show."
2163,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Great pod cast!,5,"So informative with references and quotes. Thank you so much for making this podcast!!
Enjoying it very much!!"

2173,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Thank You Dr. Porat!,5,"As a newer to the field ICU RN I find these podcasts invaluable! Unfortunately, only a few of the Hospitalists where I work will take the time to discuss a patient‚Äôs disease process with nursing and explain the ‚Äúhow and why‚Äù behind the treatments and interventions we are using. Marino‚Äôs ICU Book and Up To Date are good references for me, but it‚Äôs great to have your podcast as well. Your podcast is mobile, so I can listen on the go, and you offer references so I can follow up when I have questions or wish to delve deeper into a subject. You are also do a great job at presenting knowledge in a ‚Äúreal world/practical application‚Äù format, with anecdotal examples as well as warnings of why certain treatments/interventions are done (or not done) for particular maladies. Please keep the podcasts coming!"
2174,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,"ITP, anemia",5,"Listened to these two lectures on my drive. They were good, informative and concise. I'm thankful to Dr Porat for taking his time and knowledge to make these podcasts. Thank you!! I'm an NP Hospitslist in a busy university tertiary hospital and we see a variety of disease processes so it's nice to refresh and hear more evidence based practice of the medical conditions Dr Porat provides. The quirky medical humor is also a nice distraction."

2181,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Excellent Quote Usage,5,üëå
2182,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Went from M.D. to philosopher with minor case of psychosis,1,"Dr. Trump used to promote great understandings of medicine but once he delved into religion he took a biased self righteous zionist turn for the worst. A specific talk he has makes completely unfounded trump wagon claims about a certain religion. It is disgusting to say the least, the level these zionists go to, to oppress others."
2183,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Enjoy the podcast,5,Second year medical student here. Found your podcast after searching for hospital medicine related podcasts. It‚Äôd be great to hear some of your experiences in this career and overall enjoyment/pros and cons about it!

2191,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,MD,5,"I nominate Dr. Gil Porat as King of the Nerds. His jokes are so bad they're good. His quotations of historical figures and literature are great. His podcasts are perfect bites of practical knowledge and his medical literature reviews are admirable. Thanks so much for doing these Dr. P. I'm a family doc turned hospitalist and from my perspective, your podcast rocks! I'll soon have listened to them all...! Please keep them coming!"
2192,Hospital and Internal Medicine Podcast,Favorite podcast,5,Thank you Dr. Parot for our informative podcasts. This is my favorite podcast to listen to. Dr Parot is funny and entertaining and hardcore informative. Looking forward to the rest of the diabetes lectures!!
2193,ERCAST,Rob Orman is the man,5,"If you're going to actually subscribe to one evidence based, CME generating podcast in emergency medicine, it this should be the one."
2194,ERCAST,"Informative, and on point",5,"If you want information that is backed by evidence-based practice and research then you won‚Äôt be disappointed by listening to these podcasts. They are cutting edge, full of info and lively!!
However, if you are listening and not being drawn into the discussion between Dr.Z and his guests or find this podcast a yawn (I am directing this comment to those who are healthcare providers: Docs/NPs/RN/PAs) then you need to seriously reflect on why you have lost your passion to effectively care for patients.
Continue to bring it on Dr.Z!!"
2195,ERCAST,Excellent,5,I‚Äôve been a practicing ED doc out of residency for 15 years. Every episode brings useful information and is well worth listening to.
2196,ERCAST,Rob has been changing my life for years,5,"Rob has been teaching me valuable and practical information for working in the ER for years - he also has this voice that makes me think that I can be a little more confident in my knowledge base and get more done for patients so it‚Äôs an intellectual and emotional support
Maria Grotz NP"
2197,ERCAST,üëç,4,Plz use number for episodes üôè
2198,ERCAST,RN,5,"RN and Director of Nursing in LTC/subacute rehab setting. Delighted to say I have found many of these episodes topical, relevant to my niche, and very informative. Wonderful find. Thank you."
2199,ERCAST,Loved the bicarb in DKA expisode,5,"Classic Internal Medicine situation where we have to be careful of the ‚Äòyes the patient died, but he had better numbers when he died‚Äô scenario. When orthodoxy gets accepted too quickly, unintended consequences with worrisome outcomes may occur."
2200,ERCAST,Relevant and reliable,5,"Ideal resource for EM residents and learners of all levels. Entertaining conversations with experts, updated weekly. Wide variety of topics from practice updates to literature reviews to physician wellness. Just keeps getting better!"
2201,ERCAST,Transformational teaching!,5,"Great GREAT podcast April 30, 2018 re addiction, changed my thinking, wow...thank you, Rob. You do a great podcast, you have a great team, you guys have a great effect on med practice, thus, then, a great effect on patients."
2202,ERCAST,The Best Info & The Best Delivery You Can Find,5,"Dr. Rob Orman is not only an awesome medical educator he is also a consummate ‚Äúradio voice‚Äù both entertaining, funny, compassionate and brilliant. I‚Äôve been listening to Robbo for over 6 years and my practice as a rural family practice provider has improved because of him. Dr. Orman also has an interest in primary care (that is appearing more and more in the ER as access is decreasing) and he expertly incorporates this info in the ER Cast discussions. In other words you don‚Äôt have to a dedicated ER provider to get a lot of useful information out of his presentations. Listen to a few of his podcasts and you‚Äôll see what I mean. You‚Äôll be hooked. His effort is obvious and his guests that he gets on the program are some of the best experts in their fields. This is a 5-Star program."
2203,ERCAST,Strong work!,5,I thoroughly enjoy listening to every podcast! The way that you present your material is both educational and entertaining. I also have a podcast and since the beginning have looked to you as a source of articulation and structure. Thank you so much for all of your heard work and keep the episodes comming!
2204,ERCAST,Excellent podcast!,5,"I am a critical care nurse, my significant other an anesthesiologist and in pain medicine. We love listening to this podcast very enlightening. It's a good review as well."

2208,ERCAST,A great podcast and review,5,This is anouther of the Itunes finest when it comes to emergency medicine/critical care. This knoledge and confidence that I gain listening to all of these podcasts especially the one about the toxic neonate is just anouther way Dr. Orman proves his bonifides.
2209,ERCAST,Always clinically useful!,5,Always great pearls in this podcast.
2210,ERCAST,Enough said,5,Absolutely fantastic.
2211,ERCAST,nurse-in-training,5,"I'm a ""mature"" nursing student (translate older and changing careers) and recently discovered your podcasts. I LOVE them. Entertaining and educational. Listening to these conversations is like tuning my ear to medical music. Thanks!"

2216,ERCAST,Top 10 EM Podcasts,5,"Rob has one of my top 10 EM/CC podcasts. Always high quality information from a humble, yet intelligent physician."
2217,ERCAST,Pure excellence,5,"Absolutely love this podcast, anyone in emergency medicine should be listening to this"
2218,ERCAST,I love Dr Orman,5,Dr Orman is amazing.
2219,ERCAST,Great!,5,Sad to see the episodes stopping though
2220,ERCAST,Great Show!,5,Glad you are continuing the show. Entertaining and engaging host. Learned a lot as an RN from this show. Always recomend it to my freinds as one of the first FOAM podcasts they should try. If you like what you hear consider subscribing to EMRAP or Primary Care RAP both of which the host is greatly involved with. You get CE and more really entertaing and educational podcasts every month.
2221,ERCAST,Informative without being boring!,5,"Pediatric ER RN- Methodist Children's ER in San Antonio, Texas. I Love the subjects and the discussions. I wish more ER doctors did podcasts!"
2222,ERCAST,"Doctor or patient, the content is relevant and intriguingly conveyed.",5,"Dr. Orman proves an excellent host. He is easy-going with his guests, which creates an atmosphere for thought provoking questions and answers. The content is relevant and he stays on topic, keeping the listener interested and engaged. I come away with a better understanding and a desire to dig deeper into each discussion Dr. Orman has so obviously taken time to research and prepare."
2223,StarTalk All-Stars,I‚Äôm all in.,5,Science matters.
2224,StarTalk All-Stars,Lots to learn here,5,"StarTalk All Stars is a nice spin off of StarTalk. Having other scientists give their perspective really opens up a whole new world of science knowledge. Been a long time since we got a new episode, I hope it's not defunct...."
2225,StarTalk All-Stars,Just Love It,5,"What's not to love? Infinite topics of great interest, directly explained by experts we'd otherwise have no contact with."
2226,StarTalk All-Stars,"I need to listen to more hosts for the full feel, but...",3,"Sarah Rose Siskind from the halloween special...yikes. I hope I don‚Äôt encounter her horrible humor in future episodes.
The information was great coming from who was interviewed, however."
2227,StarTalk All-Stars,"Good podcast, but stop the stupid political comments",4,"Love the content and most hosts, but the annoying political comments and ripping the Republican Party gets old"
2228,StarTalk All-Stars,Cow Farts,2,"Does Natalia Reagan think she is being funny talking about cow farts, spider monkey dumps and monkey-butt coffee?
October 29: Still annoying"
2229,StarTalk All-Stars,Neil and Chuck best duo!,5,Chuck is hysterical and I love the chemistry between Neil and Him. Great diversity in topics with every episode extremely engaging.
2230,StarTalk All-Stars,Heat-death of the podverse,2,"StarTalk started out great. NDT is funny, interesting, and educational. StarTalk Allstars...not so much. Repetitive (seriously, how many times much we have a tedious explanation of the Drake equation?), sometimes downright obnoxious (Dr. Funkyspoon? Really?) and more often than not the science takes a backseat to bad comedy. I frequently find myself deleting these episodes, except if NDT, Porco, or Massimino are hosting. This podcast has stretched itself too thin to be meaningful."
2231,StarTalk All-Stars,Let science speak for itself,2,"I enjoy the format of this podcast and learn a lot each episode. Please, let the science speak for itself; providing political commentary unrelated to the subject distracts from the discussion and turns off listeners."
2232,StarTalk All-Stars,Repeats podcasts.,2,"I don‚Äôt appreciate that it repeats episodes repeatedly. If I wanted to listen to an episode again, I‚Äôll redownload it. It just comes off as a transparent attempt to get more ad revenue off me. I also don‚Äôt care to use data to download something I‚Äôve already heard."
2233,StarTalk All-Stars,Great cast of characters!,5,"Neil is amazing on startalk, bitty I love the variety of experts hosting these episodes. BNye is the best! Love Carolyn Porco and the rest."
2234,StarTalk All-Stars,Science!,5,If you are curious about our universe you should probably subscribe and listen:) Keep up the great work!
2235,StarTalk All-Stars,Consistently Enjoyable,4,"While the hosts vary in style and ability, they do consistently facilitate interesting discussion that delves deeper into a subject matter than many other programs."
2236,StarTalk All-Stars,Startalk All Stars,5,Love this podcast! It is produced so well! I look forward to this treat every Tuesday.
2237,StarTalk All-Stars,Great Podcast.,5,Chuck Nice is hilarious and he also has a lot of knowledge about space. The guests are great as well. Love to listen to the podcasts.
2238,StarTalk All-Stars,‚ù§,5,"I love this podcast! I really enjoy the combination of comedy and science...literally my two favorite things. The last few episodes have been on exactly what I wanted them to be on, oddly. I was interested in the possibilities of life in the TRAPPIST planetary system and I loved the ""It's a trap,"" song. Keep it up!!"
2239,StarTalk All-Stars,"Fun, enlightening, and hilarious!",5,Great show for those who enjoy the sounds of scientific experts casually discussing the universe.
2240,StarTalk All-Stars,Keep Looking Up!,5,"I love StarTalk All-Stars. I feel like this spinoff allows for the exploration of topics that used to be outside of the expertise of the more regular hosts. Love you Neil, but for primatology I need my Natalia Reagan! As a wildife biologist I'm hoping for more wildlife-centric topics, hopefully discussing conservation and management within the United States!"
2241,StarTalk All-Stars,Chuck makes baby Jesus cry,1,He makes a great podcast almost unbearable.
2242,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Glad I found this!,5,Made this pandemic much more bearable! Keep up the great work!!
2243,Hillbilly Horror Stories,It's okay. Not bad.,3,"It's an okay show. The content is great and the hosts are very nice and knowledgeable. Having said that, Tracy has a REALLY LOUD, ear-splitting laugh, so be sure to keep your hands on the volume if you're listening over car speakers or headphones. Other than that though, it's a good podcast."
2244,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Yes Yes Yes,5,Lovvvve this show! I love their banter I feel like I know them! ‚ò∫Ô∏èTracy can you be my mom please!!
2245,Hillbilly Horror Stories,I love you guys!,5,I‚Äôve been listening to you guys since last summer and I really enjoy listening to your stories. I came across you guys when I was out working with my dad over the summer and just needed something to listen to while i was working. I‚Äôve always liked listening to stories and things supernatural so your podcast was just perfect! Keep up the great work! ‚ù§Ô∏è
2246,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Jokes,5,Been listening for a couple months and I love the jokes.
2247,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Sweet and Sassy,5,"I love a good paranormal podcast, and this one is right at the top. They are just good people who love to tell ghost stories. They promote other podcasts and I love Tracy. She is what makes this podcast stand out because she is clearly not a paranormal expert, but is so sweet and open and kind. Also, so much bonus content!! Love it and Thank You!!"
2248,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Love the stories,5,"I have been listening for about a year now, and this has become my favorite paranormal podcast. Interesting stories with a Southern twang!"
2249,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Story is great if u can get through it,2,I‚Äôve never taken the time to do a review but I‚Äôve also n get been so disappointed. Each podcast I tried to listen to I had to wait 10-15 minutes to get to the story then once it starts he‚Äôs constantly interrupted with comments from his co-host that just aren‚Äôt necessary like when they were describing the sound of some noise that sounds likes ‚Äúan ape beating on his chest‚Äù she says ‚ÄúI was gonna say beating his meat‚Äù was it necessary? No just annoying I want to hear the story not constant interruptions. I get the talking it‚Äôs a podcast but when u finally get to the story let the story be told! The. Comment. So we can actually hear what‚Äôs going on!
2250,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Mojo 88,5,Awesome show
2251,Hillbilly Horror Stories,LOVE THESE TWO,5,"Tracy and Jerry fully embrace their Hillbilly essence shamelessly. A person cant help but love this couple! Jerry and Tracy discuss ghost stories and paranormal mysteries which is merely the ‚Äúbase camp‚Äù for the truly important ‚Äúreal work.‚Äù Tracy and Jerry serve our folks in the military and those of us who‚Äôve considered suicide as a viable option. This couple actively creates a necessarily connective community for a very well deserving and often ignored and (many times) seemingly forgotten population: the U.S. Military. Hillbilly Horror Stories is worth the listen just because they make the unseen feel seen, heard, and deeply loved. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2252,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Weekday episodes,5,"Love listening to the show. The new additions to the show, the short weekday shows are great.
I try to listen to a lot of different podcast. But I find myself enjoying just a few that I truly look forward to. HHHS is one of these podcast.
Now with the new mini stories, I don‚Äôt have to wait. Thanks so much."

2254,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Awesome,5,"Updating review: These guys put their hearts into this podcast and the people who listen to it. They love their listeners and it shows! The only thing I‚Äôll say is, it will take me forever to catch up with all of the content they put out. But that‚Äôs a good problem to have üòâ
You guys are awesome! I‚Äôm very much enjoying listening! Keep up the good work!"
2255,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Foggy Jack Live Podcast,5,"This is a podcast that is simple the best! These two have given me the inspiration to start my own! Hillbilly horror stories goes above and beyond in there shows and you can truly tell. They are funny, smart, and very very funny. I love Tracie‚Äôs laugh and Jerry‚Äôs bald head! We LOVE AND I REPEAT LOVE LOVE LOVE this show to the moon and back!!"

2262,Hillbilly Horror Stories,"‚ù§Ô∏è kind genuine people, great highly entertaining comedy horror podcast",5,"I love this podcast. Great comedy when applicable and to lighten the mood. Well researched, planned, organized thought out and created with good intent. Both of you radiate kindness and love. Please don‚Äôt let others convince you of different. I‚Äôm amazed at your ability to accept constructive criticism and your American pride honoring those who serve and always being gracious and respectful. Thank you both."
2263,Hillbilly Horror Stories,I‚Äôm hooked,5,Found this podcast because of Derek Hayes. 1. Great content. 2. You guys are genuine. 3. It‚Äôs a quality production. 4. Keep the witty repertoire coming. As long as you‚Äôre producing. I‚Äôll. Be listening

2265,Hillbilly Horror Stories,You guys rock!,5,"You make me feel like you‚Äôre people I‚Äôve known for years. You can tell you‚Äôre legitimate human beings, that truly care about others. Thank you for all your hard work, I appreciate you more than you know!"
2266,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Jerry and Tracy are so engaging!,4,"Having binged my way through both Astonishing Legends and Graveyard Tales, I needed a new podcast to entertain me while I wait for new episodes...and man does this fit the bill. Paranormal topics, Jerry is either a former (or current) stand up comic which appeals to me because I've done stand up for 20+ years and Tracy is a dear. My lady loves her and frankly so do I...she is sweet and sensitive and so relatable. She is also responsible for some unique tangents and unintentional jokes. So, if you are looking for a good podcast, you've found it!"
2267,Hillbilly Horror Stories,One of the best podcasts period,5,"I love these two. They cover great topics, they give you great detail and if you don‚Äôt like this show you are broken. Theme song is awful. Just not good. The show itself is top shelf. Great show"
2268,Hillbilly Horror Stories,Awesome PC,5,"Hey guys! I‚Äôve been listening to HHS since November I think. I‚Äôve really enjoyed the stories and recently joined the fb group which is amazing!
I love you guys!"

2275,The Beautiful Universe: Chandra in HD,Content!,2,Okay these are too short and could improve by providing more content.. Don't tell me there is a lack of content available .. Why bother with a couple of minutes of stuff.. Too less to be worth the time and effort...

2279,The Beautiful Universe: Chandra in HD,Could've Been Great,2,"The pictures were great, but the feeds are really choppy. Even for one minute pcasts, it's just not worth the time. If they ever upgrade the quality I'd subscribe immediately. Until then, sorry."

2290,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,What happened?!?,3,"This used to be a fantastic podcast for staying up to date and also allowed for a few laughs here and there. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs taken a back slide lately and has become droll, dry and boring. The few jokes that are attempted are just NOT FUNNY, and take up way too much air time. Case in point: the July 1st episode with the ‚Äúwhat sound is that?‚Äù segment. Waste of time."
2291,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Colorado FP,5,This is wonderful! Please keep it up!
2292,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,"Thanks, I've been waiting for this!!!!",5,"This is now one of my favorite podcasts.

2296,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Great adjunct to the journal,4,"This is great when you need to bump up your CME hours. After listening to this, I was able to answer about 40% of the questions on the AFP questionnaire re. that issue. I can then read through to clarify whatever I missed, read another 2 articles and finish off the quiz.
The reviewers are clear and bring in good practical, clinical points. I may have to increase my rating to 5 stars as I keep listening to these."
2297,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Excellent!!!!,5,Brings a busy mom up to date in 20min and entertaining at the same time ;))
2298,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Journal podcast,5,VERY well done and easy to listen and retain the information. Their sense of humor is nice too. I've been able to listen and go to the CME app and pass the tests which is further evidence to me that I am getting the info.
2299,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Your Podcast,5,"I am a medical professional, doing data input of emergency room cases for our hospital. This is quite tedious work, so one of my co-workers recommended I listen to Podcasts. Yours was one of the first I have tried, and I love it! Not only do I get very useful information for job purposes, but also for me as a person. I love the interaction between everyone, and your sense of humor.
These podcasts help me get through some very tedious days.. And in addition, I found out about Sawbones, from one of your podcasts, and now and quite entertained by that one. Thanks you!!!"

2305,AFP: American Family Physician Podcast,Great podcast for FNP students!,5,"Granted, I‚Äôm not a doctor and never will be, but as a FNP student after 22 years of being a critical care nurse, I appreciate the ‚Äúbullet point‚Äù approach to this show. The docs are fun to listen to and make material that is not always ‚Äústimulating‚Äù fun to learn. Great focus on EBP. I‚Äôve recruited so many docs into listening. You know what they say, ‚Äútelecom, telephone, tell a nurse!‚Äù.
Thanks for all the hard work!!"

Finding AFP podcast on the app store was like finding a life saving oasis in the desert, it's a treasure and I enjoy listening to it every chance I get it. The team that produces the podcast is not only knowledgeable but also funny and makes the whole presentation quite entertaining and educational at the same time. I just wanted to thank the University of Arizona residents, fellows and the faculty for doing such a wonderful job for the rest of us family physicians."
2313,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Uhhhhh,1,"If you‚Äôre going to have a podcast to help nursing students learn medication, at least learn how to properly pronounce the names.

Very great podcast!"
2316,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),A great resource!,5,"I have followed NRSNG since I was in nursing school, all of the podcasts are informative.

2317,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Life raft for an RN student,5,"I found NRSNG a couple years ago when acceptance to nursing school seemed a million miles away. Now I'm here üôèüôè and boy, Jon Haws, RN had it right! My school is ranked #3 in my state and yet I feel lost on so many days. Why? Because there's so much to do and learn, so much material and really we are being taught and graded by experts who can't help but point out what we don't know. It's their job. But many times we don't even know where to go for the info until we get the wrong answer. It's an absolutes insane experience. I can't tell you how much it helps to have one more recourse which is concise and searchable. The topics covered are so vast that if I know I need work on a topic I search and find it. I've felt that Potassium was my Achilles heel since Physio but now I can listen to a podcast on repeat and well, I already feel more confident. Thank you!!! Oh and I ordered the Lab Values and Nursing Mnemonics books on Amazon. So grateful."
2318,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),"NRSNG is exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered!",5,"Thank you so much for creating these podcasts, your hard work is appreciated! The NRSNG program is a tremendous gift for all future nurses, it's exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered! I can't wait to see you on the other side and call you my colleague. ~ FUTURE RN"
2319,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),"Great, informative and supportive!",5,"As a nurse away from the bedside for a long time, I returned 2 years ago to a busy Med-Surg unit. I felt like a like a new graduate again and wanted to ramp up to competence and confidence. This free and generous podcast is achieving the goal of helping nurses at all stages in their careers. I think nurses are like warriors and only other nurses truly understand the many challenges we face in the fox hole together. I love the act of nursing and after doing many healthcare related careers still find bedside nursing to be the most meaningful but also the most stressful and challenging, especially while being short staffed so often. Thanks for the support this podcast offers!"
2320,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Jon Haws is the best!,5,"I'm a new nursing student and everywhere I look for the ""best nursing student resources"" his products come up. He explains things in common-sense terms and so much of his info is FREE. You will learn from this!"
2321,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Great for everyone!!!,5,Im a recent grad waiting to take my NCLEX.... I listen to a couple podcasts a day on my runs! So awesome to be learning and refreshing my memory while Im running! Talk about multi tasking!!!! Download now people!!!
2322,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Great Quick Refresher!,5,I have been away from bedside nursing for a time. This podcast has been a great refresher. He explains meds in a way that both makes sense and is easily remembered!
2323,MedMaster Show (Nursing Podcast: Pharmacology and Medications for Nurses and Nursing Students by NRSNG),Awesome!!!!,5,"John Haas teaches us about these meds in an informative and entertaining way. Thank you very much, and please keep it up."
2324,Are We There Yet?,Misleading Description,2,"This ‚Äúspace exploration‚Äù podcast has so far only talked about teaching, astronomy, Millennials, and sci-fi."
2325,Are We There Yet?,WOW!!!!,5,Wow!! After listening to this podcast everything just ‚Äúclicked‚Äù. Now i am much more aware of what it takes to do these things and to make humans finally interplanetary.
2326,Are We There Yet?,Brass tacks,5,Great content
2327,Are We There Yet?,too short,2,should be long form and in depth considering the subject matter. most episodes barely reach 30 mins. sad
2328,Are We There Yet?,How about,5,Male host!
2329,Are We There Yet?,excellent,5,"Finally a space podcast with no background music so that you can hear every word that is spoken! Thank you for a clear, thoughtful and interesting podcast!"
2330,Are We There Yet?,Great Mars podcast,5,This podcast has great information on all Mars related topics. Highly recommend for anyone interested in Mars or space science. The host has access to very interesting people in the industry that make for very informative interviews.
2331,Are We There Yet?,Great,5,Awesome show for space and aeronautics nerds.
2332,Are We There Yet?,Great science and rocket podcast,5,This is an amazing podcast for anyone who wants to learn about rockets and spacecraft stuff. Science is so important and WE ALL need to learn more and love science
2333,Are We There Yet?,Instantly hooked - great show,5,This new era of space exploration is exciting and there's some much going on at every stage. This show's focus on Mars is fantastic and the steps outside that focus are a welcome addition.
2334,Are We There Yet?,Deep dive into what it takes to get to space,5,"This show is a deep dive into what it takes to get to space. Great stuff so far and looking forward to future episodes, exploring further the tools, the people and the processes that it takes to put people on Mars!"
2335,Are We There Yet?,Love the premise,5,SPACE TRAVEL!!!
2336,Are We There Yet?,Everything you wanted to know about Mars mission.,5,"This is a fantastic podcast! ‚ÄúAre We There Yet‚Äù pulls back the curtain and gives you a behind the scenes look at NASA, the mars mission and asks all the questions you ever wanted to know. Brendan Byrne (Host) does a great job and asks all the questions I want to know! Keep up the great work!"
2337,Are We There Yet?,Awesome show!/I might of posted this twice but it's because the show is so good,5,I've listened to every episode and I'm hooked! Complex ideas and leading experts are presented in way that lets even the amateur astronaut follow along easily. New technologies and concepts are examined that help you to see that although mars is far off it's getting increasingly closer every single day. New episodes being released are one of the top highlights of my week and I look foward to what is disscused next! (But if your taking suggestions I'd like to hear an episode about long term colnization ideas)
2338,Are We There Yet?,Interesting and close to home,5,The thing I love most about this podcast is that it talks to real people at NASA and Lockheed Martin that are planning and building space ships. My favorite episode was Some Assembly Required where it talked all about the Orion Spacecraft and what goes into building it.
2339,Are We There Yet?,What to listen to after NASA trip,5,Both myself & my 12 year old son really like this show. After our spring trip to NASA we wanted to keep that interest going. The shows are appealing to both of us - advanced but well discussed & explained. The show is well planned & topics are intentional. Great choice!
2340,Are We There Yet?,Best podcast on its subject,5,"I love this podcast. It really is the best audio show about space I have ever found. That being said, to give a little constructive criticism, it does come off a little stiff. Then again, Brendon, the host, is dealing with some of the nerdiest people in the world. It's amazing they have any speaking skills at all. :-) Brendan does an admirable job interviewing the experts, and getting answers from them that make sense to simple nerds like me."
2341,Are We There Yet?,Excellent Space Podcast,5,Listening to this podcast is a great way to keep up with the latest developments in space exploration.
2342,Are We There Yet?,Instantly became one of my favorite podcasts,5,"AWTY instantly became one of my regular weekly podcasts along with StarTalk, Planetary Radio, and The Infinite Monkey Cage. I hate to sound super cliche but it pretty much should be an essential addition to any space junkies regular weekly lineup. I love the variety of guests and the interesting stories and projects they bring to the show. Looking forward to many more episodes. Thanks for the show Mr. Byrne!"
2343,Are We There Yet?,Awesome,5,Love it. Thanks for the work!
2344,Are We There Yet?,My favorite new listen,5,Definitely on my short list of shows to not miss every week!
2345,Are We There Yet?,How about,4,A female cohost.
2346,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Awesome idea for a podcast!,5,"Great, this should be required listening for high school students."
2347,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Love it! Very smart people.,5,Can we get more of these?
2348,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Blows My Mind,5,Quite often they talk about things that are over my head but in general it's a fantastic source for recent news items and fun scientific facts. I love it and listen to this podcast all the time whilst at work.
2349,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Excellent Podcast!,5,You will not regret subscribing to this podcast. It's packed full of science fun and the host Steven Novella does an excellent job of organizing and producing the show. I've listened to this show since it started and have loved every episode. Aside from the entertainment quality the discussions on logic and evaluation of arguments and evidence helps listeners to develop their own ability to determine the truthfulness of pseudo scientific claims. Get this podcast!!
2350,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Awesome,5,I love this podcast
2351,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Best,5,"Hands down the best, short, skeptical podcast on the net."
2352,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Stop shouting.,3,I like this podcast but cant stand when they shout into the mic & try to be funny..it gets old really fast.
2353,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Great show!!,5,Love it!
2354,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,"Complete devoid of actusly debunking,",1,"As a general skeptic, I hoped to find a good source of facts that could be used to aid the debunking of some of the more popular and accepted myths and conspiracy theories. Instead I found nothing more than a bunch of people who laugh at those who do believe in such things without offering any facts or information explaining why these popular myths and conspiracy theories are inaccurate and unfounded. The podcast offers little more than constantly repeating the manta of, ""People who believe (name your conspiracy theory) are nuts and fools, and that's all youy need to know."" No meat, no facts, no arguments based in scientific evidence and, therefor, this isn't a debunking podcast at all. Very disappouinting. There are much better skeptic podcasts out there."
2355,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,"More subject matter, less stand up",1,"You guys used to take this podcast seriously and present it in a concise, succinct manner. Now all you do is try to keep the comedic banter going on and on. If I want comedy, I can download Conan. Get back on track."
2356,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Mini bites of awesome,5,A must have!
2357,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Learn Lots!,5,"These are quick, yet in depth disections of various relevent topics. 5 minutes and you know everything there is to know about a given skeptical topic. Pull all these on your mp3 device and boost your brain."
2358,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Great short analysis!,5,"This is a great on the run podcast! For those asking for expert interviews and other analysis outside of the literature, you really need to turn to the full Skeptic's Guide to the Universe Podcast for that, not the 5 min podcast. Keep it up guys (and Rebecca)."
2359,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,One if the best podcasts avilable,5,'nuff said...
2360,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Incredible!,5,Bite-sized intelligence; full of clear thinking and reason. Wonderful
2361,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,A great Quickie,5,5 minute skeptic bites!
2362,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,best bang for your reality buck,5,Need a quick fix? You can't beat this quick shot of reality. ahhhhhh
2363,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Sexxxy,5,!!!
2364,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,definitely recommend!,5,"i really enjoy this podcast; sometimes i find the longer skeptic's guide show to be a bit too long, and i like that this one is short and sweet."
2365,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Awesome,5,Listen once and you'll be hooked!
2366,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Love it!,5,"Great ""101"" lessons in critical thinking. They need to do more, more, MORE!"
2367,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,?,2,"I'm sorry, I like science and all we can prove or not. But the being a skeptic for the sake of
being a skeptic. Well that gets old quick. Sometimes I gatta wonder if these people would
accept their mothers word on the time of day. The production quality is good and is very
listenable. But I do not listen anymore."
2368,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Good show,5,Good show give it a try
2369,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,A Convenient Package of Bite-Sized Rogues!,5,"You guys seriously rock! I'd say you have the best skeptical podcast out there, and Dr. Novella, your production skills are superb! Your opening theme is also most excellent! Best wishes to all of you, and keep up the good work!"
2370,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,"Great companion podcast, but...",5,"... where are the new episodes, guys? Five minutes a week is easy, not sure why it has been nearly five months since this was updated."
2371,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Lots of info packed in 5,5,I love 5x5 -- so much info presented in such a compact timeframe. I hope they start making these again.
2372,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Prairiemay,1,"The subject matter might have been good- I downloaded several episodes because it sounded interesting, but after listening for 20 minutes to their self congratulating, snorting over each others jokes as if auditioning for Car Talk and exhorting me to tell all my friends to tune in, all without touching the subject matter, I deleted everything. Can I get my time refunded?"
2373,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,Very informative,5,Love it.
2374,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,So happy to see a new episode!,5,"This is a great, quick companion to the original SGU, or a good starter for new listeners. I've been wondering what happened, and I'm glad to see it's back!"
2375,The Skeptics' Guide 5X5,5x5 oustanding,5,"These are great, short educational pieces that are cuss free. Outstanding and appropriate for kids."
2376,The Math Factor,Awesome & approachable,5,Accessible math without the lectures. Only the fun challenging stuff - none of the tedium. THANKS
2377,The Math Factor,Math rocks my socks,5,Best thing on iTunes!
2378,The Math Factor,Chit-chatty,3,"Our hosts, while providing interesting information, like to chit-chat. Personally, I find it distracting. I'd prefer a bit of concise information or enlightenment without the social interchange."
2379,The Math Factor,Mathemagical,4,Great variety of topics. As an AP Calculus teacher I enjoy exploring the subject matter with my students and challenging them with the puzzles.
2380,The Math Factor,awesome!,5,awesome!!! should be changed to a twice weekly show
2381,The Math Factor,Great Puzzles to Feed the Brain,4,"A wonderful podcast. Short puzzles to make you think. I really enjoy the two hosts. Makes you feel that maybe the Ozark Mountains aren't a bad place to settle down. And do math.
But the math is really easy and these guys make you feel smart."
2382,The Math Factor,A weekly workout for your brain.,5,"Moves beyond ""Train A leaves Station B"" questions into fascinating aspects of math, logic and science."
2383,The Math Factor,!nf!n!tely better than other podcasts!,5,"This is a great podcast with math and logic stuff to fill one's brain.
Chaim and Kyle definitely deliver a quality program."
2384,The Math Factor,Not Just For Mathletes,5,"This podcast will be loved by the math experts and the beginners alike. As an adult of only average mathematical ability, this podcast opened up doors for me, showing me that math is not abstract cryptic cave-paintings, but instead a logical and constant system of thinking. The two hosts are pleasant to hear and provide clarity and translation to concepts that were most likely explained poorly in one's past schooling. If you enjoy math, this is your podcast, but if you do not enjoy math, this is also your podcast. Because the segments are from radio, the times are limited (from 2 to 7 minutes or so), but the backlog is impressive, and will sustain you for a while. Give this a chance, and you will likely love it, especially if math was never your strongest ability. I credit this podcast with rekindling my learning of math... I can feel the neurons connecting each time I listen."
2385,The Math Factor,"Giles will never say ""this could be math-ier.""",5,"Great show, fun puzzles, and the possibility of free Math Cards and Math Stickers.
I mean, free Math cards! They are cards with Math! And they are free!"
2386,The Math Factor,HEHEHEHE,5,"I really like this podcast. It is very interesting. Well... to me it is, because i'm a nerd. hehehehe. So if u r a nurd like me, i recomend it."
2387,The Math Factor,A Break from the Ordinary,5,"A pensive, entertaining, and light hearted discussion about math. The hosts get to the point with examples and solutions that can be used to amuse others. Great listening during walks."
2388,The Math Factor,really good podcast,4,"This podcast is a lot of fun to listen to -- math can be fun!
I would give it 5 stars except for one very annoying thing -- the audio quality is horrible. Please record the show at a much higher volume, and make sure the program is static free. Otherwise...I love it!"
2389,The Math Factor,Nice podcast,5,"This is a fun, engaging math or number puzzle based podcast. It is short, concise and entertaining.
The episodes I have listened to so far were well produced with no volume issues."
2390,The Math Factor,I like it,4,It's pretty good. I'm home schooled and I can get high school credit for listening to it... so I like it!
2391,The Math Factor,Great show!,5,"Nicely done, keep it up !"
2392,The Math Factor,squeezethis,3,"I love puzzles and math, but this got off to a slow start with simple stuff like a fox, chicken, and corn crossing the river. I found it difficult to hear, speak up a little. Also a little too much Ozark insider hee-haw. Yet I stayed with it and several episodes in the puzzles became more challenging, the audio clearer, and the humor more cosmopolitan. Will keep listening."
2393,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Long time listener.,5,"I started listening to these about five years ago. I was doing locums work at the time and was on the road a lot, so I downloaded all of them and listened to all. Yes. I have ocd like symptoms. I bought the ap for iphone and enjoy and use it frequently. Thanks for all of your work in educating the masses."
2394,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Great work podcast,5,"I love this podcast, it makes great work-listen-to he explains everything that I want to know and cuts out frankly the bullpucking noise that happens in papers. He also is very honest in his opinions about the current state of the literature. I listen to the previous ones until he makes a new one. So 10/10 would recommend to everyone with a science based heart."
2395,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Great resource for someone in training,5,"As a resident aspiring to ID fellowship, I love listening to the puscast and the gobbet of pus respectively as a succinct summary of new and important literature in ID, and as a neat review of Dr. Crislip's cases ranging from the horse to the zebra."
2396,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,A playful punderful podcast,5,I come for the articles and stay for the puns. This is a literature review podcast you‚Äôll remember. Keep up the great work!
2397,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Good info please leave out politics,3,I always thought ID was infectious disease but in today‚Äôs world we can‚Äôt escape politics anywhere so here it‚Äôs Idealogical Debate. Good info but snarky political comments thrown in. PLEASE just leave it out. Politics permeates everything. Why? Doesn‚Äôt belong in an ID talk. I‚Äôd give 5 stars if he‚Äôd just stick to the topic.
2398,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Glowing review,5,Dr. C is a wonderful and insightful doctor and this podcast has changed my life
2399,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Lovely!,5,Not boring and keeps you up to date! Even those that aren‚Äôt too familiar with medical terminology will find it easy too follow üòäüëè
2400,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,The world needs more Mark Crislip,5,I've been listening to this guy for nearly a decade and he is fantastic!
2401,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Excellent,5,"Crislip presents ID literature relevant to all medical specialties in a humorous and entertaining manner. The information is both interesting and extremely clinically relevant for those at each stage of training.
Education and entertainment at the same time - who can beat that. I even made an iTunes account just to review this podcast.. It's that good."
2402,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Great way to Keep Current,5,"As a few podcaster (One of the hosts of This Week in Parasitism (TWIP)) also available on iTunes I have for some time had this podcast recommended to me. I first heard of 'The Puscast' while working in India, then again in Thailand, then Cambodia, and well I finally decided I needed to give it a listen. Being a competitive fellow I was not prepared to enjoy this podcast as much as I do!First I thought I did not have the time. Our podcast is often two hour slong and people listen in parts but to my delight this little 20 minute segments are something I get bite off and swallow on my way to the different hospitals where I round as an Infectious Disease Physician. My advice...If you are trying to keep up with the literature...You definitely have the time to listen to the puscast everytime it comes out. Even if you spend many hours reading the literature Dr Crislip's take on it all is memorable and spot on. Now if you have another 1-2 hours a week and love parasites and all the other bugs .... well them This Week in Parasitism and the rest of the This Week in Virology, Microbiology, etc are for you. Now just who is this Persiflagers fellow? :-)"
2403,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Love it,5,This is essentially a very entertaining journal club. Love it and please keep it up!
2404,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Glowing Review,5,"Persiflagers Puscast is, as my Grandma Phyllis would say, the bee‚Äôs knees. I am both greatly entertained and engaged in the content of this podcast. If you work in healthcare, studying to work in healthcare, or are just thirsty for knowledge of the world of Infectious Disease, I can‚Äôt recommend this podcast enough.
Dr. Crislip‚Äôs other Podcast are also wonderful. I listen to ‚ÄúGobbet‚Äù while I‚Äôm doing chores. Dually productive."
2405,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Fabulous,5,"A fanstastic way to keep up with the liturature and get solid commentary on what's worth while and what's not. I gain knowlege I use every day-every time I listen.
I recommend this to all my medical/pharmacy students"
2406,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Awesome!,5,"This is a great podcast to listen while commuting to work, informative and entertaining. The best in ID out there. It would be awesome to also earn CME credits from it, hope that will be possible in the future?.."
2407,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Excellent,5,"Engaging, amusing, and informative. What more could I ask for?"
2408,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Great for those not in ID,5,Helps keep me up to date on topics closely related to but not directly related to my own field.
2409,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,I'm addicted!,5,"Such a fun, informative podcast. Great supplement to staying up-to-date on the recent ID literature. I appreciate the personality-infused style, it makes listening easy. Thanks for the entertainment!"
2410,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Very Interesting and useful,5,Awesome way to learn about these diseases.
2411,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Informative and entertaining!,5,"As a clinical pharmacist that loves infectious disease and travels an hour each way for work, this is a great review and a good way to stay update. Very entertaining!"
2412,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Professional and Entertaining,5,Good compilation of medical data transmitted in a friendly way.
2413,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,"Informative, entertaining",5,"Dr. Crislip does a great job of summarizing the literature and also providing enough commentary and jokes to help you contextualize what you're hearing and keep you awake. My only complaint is that his selection of articles is a little imbalanced - the podcast would be much improved by a greater focus on Harris County, Texas."
2414,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Good medicine,5,"I‚Äôm not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV, but I‚Äôve been fascinated by epidemiology since my parasitology course - and listening to Mark is a great overview of new research - presented in a warm and personable way. The bulk of the show is a review of studies methodologies and outcomes, the pros & cons thereof, and how they relate to other research or reality. And I, for one, like the occasional little jokes and respect his experience with how politics/ human behavior and epidemics interact."
2415,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Good Stuff,5,"Glad to see you brought back your original music. A nice raw sound. Too many podcasters seem to think everybody wants to hear their favorite rock song turned up to eleven.
Keep up the great work.
Mike from Oregon"
2416,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Fantastic and amusing review of ID literature,5,"I've been listening to this for about 5 years and have become thorougly inculcated in Mark Crislip's tropes. For a combination of useful ID literature, puns and dad jokes he can't be beat. I look forward to listening to many more."
2417,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Jjune2061,5,This is an excellent podcast! It is so entertaining and I love listening to it and learning what's new in ID
2418,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,More than a literature review,5,"Not only does this podcast do a great job covering important infectious disease literature, but it is also much more entertaining than I ever would have expected. I love this podcast. Mark Crislip is awesome."
2419,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,"Non-medical personnel love it, too!",5,"I love this for his wit and snark, on top of interesting tidbits I can follow along without knowing much detailed medical information (although I'm sure I'm missing more details)."
2420,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,"Puss, the final frontier...",5,"Helps me keep up with ID for only an hour per month freeing me up for other reading, plus the political commentary is amusing. Ever notice that the anti-vax parents are always the first in line to demand antibiotics for their kid's sore throat?"
2421,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Love Him!,5,"Superb content I recommend it to every medical student resident and fellow( not to mention us old-timers).
His quips and asides are delightful and almost make you forget the current political landscape.
Just love this podcast."
2422,Persiflagers Infectious Disease Puscast,Education with Independent Expressions,5,"I have listened to a plethora of podcasts and this, along with emcrit are my favorite two podcasts. Maybe it's because they are independent thinkers, maybe it's because they speak their mind, or maybe it's because they use occasional bits of colorful language. It's probably because of all these and why the educational experience of their podcast is so effortlessly consumed. I'm tired of the complainers and their snootiness, nose in the air attitude. If they think they can put out a better podcast that people would actually listen too they should try, instead of griping because someone uses the occasional interesting language that they find offensive. If you can't handle it you should go spend your life at church and become a pastor...and grow up. Good god, let's see you do better."
2423,Outside/In,Was interesting,2,"I like this show until this recent episode about big cats/TigerKing. The lady that was on talking about Carole Baskin is a moron. For starters, the show was made for entertainment. Secondly, Carole isn‚Äôt anymore of a decent human than Joe, excepting the fact that she doesn‚Äôt breed. She still keeps too many in cages. She still shows them off like they‚Äôre in a zoo. She‚Äôs a lowlife too. Maybe you should‚Äôve had someone on looking at both sides of the story. Dumb!"
2424,Outside/In,"Intriguing, interesting, important",5,"Great story telling. From fun facts to more important topics, I love Outside In! It is an easy listen and a good break from politics and everyday things ‚Äî all while still putting your brain to work. Keep up the amazing work!"
2425,Outside/In,Compelling topics and great co-hosts,5,"Well produced, interesting topics and great co-hosts."
2426,Outside/In,Excellent Content!!,5,Solid reporting on extremely important issues to our time that is woven with brilliant storytelling! Highly recommend!
2427,Outside/In,"Amazingly entertaining, thoughtful, educational, and genuine",5,"I wholly enjoy listening to each and every episode of Outside/In. The production style brings an endearing realism to the interactions between the hosts and the subjects of the show, and the thoughtfulness of the reporting and story-like approach to the interviews draw me in and keep me interested throughout the entirety of each episode. I also really enjoy the laughter, silliness, and quippy interaction the hosts share between themselves - great blending of education and entertainment!"
2428,Outside/In,A Hallmark of Nature Journalism,5,"I‚Äôm a new science journalist and I avidly listen to Outside/In. For me, this show is in many ways the model for making nature stories stylish, yet tasteful and informing. A wildly fun and interesting team of writers and producers who manage to cover a broad spectrum of topics from over population, to hiking fads, fancy cats, and more.
You won‚Äôt regret a minute of this show."
2429,Outside/In,Don‚Äôt Miss This One,5,"Outside/In is a well produced, well researched, thought provoking, engaging and informative storytelling machine."
2430,Outside/In,Well worth your time,5,"Every episode is educational in a well-presented and sometimes amusing format...definitely thought-provoking. The staff puts a lot of effort into every episode, and they seem to work very well together."
2431,Outside/In,Astrology... seriously?,2,"I had a great deal of respect for this podcast series until the astrology episode, ""Leo Rising"". I really am floored with the seriousness with which they treat such nonsense. I can only describe it as if someone I look to for information were to slip into casual covnerstaion that they believed in Leprechauns. It casts the entiritly of everything I learned from the series into doubt. Very, very disappointed."
2432,Outside/In,So good!,5,Excellent podcast. Look forward to new episodes. Thank you for making this podcast.
2433,Outside/In,Never fails to drop jaw,5,Thank you all so much for your insightful podcasts. The app needs to make it easier for people to directly pay you all. Tip your podcasters. This podcast don‚Äôt run on thanks... and does anyone like advertisements?
2434,Outside/In,Decent outdoor minded show,3,"I am always on the lookout for new podcasts and found this one on a list of outdoor minded shows. Overall, Outside/In is a decent show as podcasts go nowadays. Once you get past the cringy bouncy amateur opening music and the annoying fake-witty banner that you get with so many non-news public radio podcasts, it's a good show. Young podcasters could learn a lot from more professional podcasters (try Radiotopia shows) but since there is a lack of good outdoor related podcasts, i'll take Outside/In."
2435,Outside/In,‚ÄúLike‚Äù,2,"Please, if I counted ‚Äúlike‚Äù in the episode I listened to‚Ä¶"
2436,Outside/In,One of my favorites,5,"The crew for this podcast are awesome, knowledgeable and passionate about what they are covering. It‚Äôs entertaining and I‚Äôm always down to nerd out with them. Highly recommend it."
2437,Outside/In,Love this podcast!,5,This is such a good look at environmental issues without being a total bummer!
2438,Outside/In,Yes!,5,There I was binging on Bear Brook and it was done. A quick check brought me to this. Binged through all the previous podcasts and then I somehow got all caught up. Now I wait patiently for the next one and I‚Äôm never disappointed. Yup it‚Äôs all good in the 603!
2439,Outside/In,The best!,5,Wish there was more episodes to binge!
2440,Outside/In,I love the investigative turn,5,I hope the tact and tone and pacing of this most recent episode becomes something you continue. I have enjoyed you for a while and have been often pleasantly surprised by your high degree of thoughtful broad-topic explorations.... But i think youre now onto something even bettter. Reminiscent of some of the better ReplyAll / tldr / Mysteryshow pods. Keep up the creative and incisive ideas
2441,Outside/In,I wish there were more podcasts like Outside In !,5,"As a girl from SoCal that has never been to NH, I still find this podcast so relatable. The storytelling is captivating and the hosts and guests have great energy. They‚Äôve also introduced me to some other great podcasts like HumaNature, and Bear Brooks. Both highly recommended! The ‚ÄúAsk Sam‚Äù segment has an awesome jingle and answers all the bizarre questions you never knew you wanted the answers to. Thanks Outside In for keeping me entertained on commutes and road trips!"
2442,Outside/In,"Informative, insightful, thought provoking, and entertaining",5,"Informative, insightful, thought provoking, and entertaining. One of the very best podcasts about humans, our place in and relationship with nature."
2443,Outside/In,The gold standard,5,"Quite simply, Outside/In is consistently the best podcast out there. Engaging hosts, entertaining topics, outstanding reporting and production. New episodes can‚Äôt come fast enough! New Hampshire Public Radio is really proving itself to be a leader in the podcast medium. And I‚Äôm unbiased‚ÄîI live on the West Coast!"
2444,Outside/In,Fun and light....mostly,5,"I like that the hosts are fun and light. Some subjects don‚Äôt allow the fun, understandable.
Great in-depth topics. Thank you!"
2445,Outside/In,Love this!,5,Such a great podcast I learn so much! Thank you for making it!
2446,Outside/In,What isn‚Äôt there to love?,5,I don‚Äôt think that I have listens to a a single episode that I haven‚Äôt liked. I listen to your podcasts while at work and to be quite honest I have listened to your podcast episodes from start to finish a couple times now. I love everything you guys talk about. Very informative and break things down for everyone to understand. Keep it up you guys!
2447,Outside/In,Informative and engaging!,5,I‚Äôve been listening to Outside/In for a little over a year now and I‚Äôm not planning on stopping any time soon. I‚Äôm learning about the ‚Äúscience-y‚Äù things I‚Äôm interested in and I‚Äôm always looking forward to the next episode. Thanks!
2448,Outside/In,Just a really good and really interesting podcast,5,"This is like a more fun and playful and outdoorsy radiolab. Well maybe not because it‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs really good, and the hosts are hilarious, accessible, and smart. Just a great show!"
2449,Outside/In,Excellent,5,Very interesting podcast! Truly enjoyable!
2450,Outside/In,Totally outstanding,5,"I've been meaning to write a review for ages - this show and this team absolutely rock. Their storytelling is always compelling, and at the same time they're able to dig deep and explore multiple perspectives. That's what I perhaps love the most - they explore their topics with genuine curiosity and respect, and while they absolutely share the facts they find they also don't require clear and simple conclusions. Life is complex and multiple perspectives can all be true, and this show holds that. And they have a lot of fun! I also love your theme music, and in fact referenced it as a good example of theme music when I wrote to NPR to express my disappointment at their new Morning Edition theme. I am a New England, environmentally-minded millennial so that's probably part of why I relate to your show so much, but I think lots of different listeners would also find it very compelling and interesting. I highly recommend it. Thank you NHPR podcast team!"
2451,Outside/In,I am always excited to listen to every episode.,5,"This is one of my absolute favorites. It concerns our relationship as human beings to the natural world. How that is investigated very so widely from episode episode. With the exception of one mini series, and I think of you two parters, you can poke around in the archive and find all kinds of amazing gems. Even those episodes that are regionally specific to the north east I find absolutely fascinating and I think you will too."
2452,Outside/In,Chris,5,"I‚Äôm a new listener, but I have to say I‚Äôve binged several episodes over the past few days simply because this show is incredible and wonderfully made. Sam has a great personality and a curiosity that makes the natural world accessible. Love this. Telling all my friends about it."
2453,Instant Anatomy,Like,4,I love the content of the podcast. Unfortunately the voice is too high in tone and talks a little to fast for me to focus on the actual content. I've tried slowing down the content but the voice is still too awkward to pay attention too. If the presenter of the podcast would slow down the information and podcast would be excellent. Thanks for all the information!!!
2454,Instant Anatomy,Great podcasts!,4,Thank you :)
2455,Instant Anatomy,Linking with website works -- but . . .,3,"The podcasts are purely audio. You must look to their website to see what is being talked about. Perhaps Dr. Whitaker can improve the podcasting to include images. It would certainly make things more interesting for the iPod/iPhone user as opposed to the person who has access to the Internet. A worthwhile podcast, but . . .. Devotees will learn, but only after working to learn."
2456,Instant Anatomy,good idea!!,4,This will help me a good deal for my midterms
2457,Instant Anatomy,Thank you,5,"Thank you Dr. Whitaker. I am going back to school for nursing and speed a lot of time on the road. Now I can learn my anatomy while driving, exersicing or sitting at my desk. Please keep this up."
2458,Instant Anatomy,Ordered CD,5,Great anatomy review if those classes are in your distant past like mine. I ordered the CD from the website. It was in my mailbox in Utah in about a week. A LOT of info. Very impressive. Thanks Dr. Whitaker!
2459,Instant Anatomy,This is THE anatomy podcast!,5,"Instant Anatomy is the no-nonsense, ""mapped-out"" type of show that' s a great length too. Keep it up y'all in the UK."
2460,Instant Anatomy,Well done. I hope many more will be forthcoming.,5,A+
2461,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Favorite,5,Been a long-time fan. Tremendous breadth in selection of topics. Highly recommended to anyone with curiosity!
2462,Engines of Our Ingenuity,"Engaging, Pleasant, & Conscise",5,"As a non-engineer/non-scientist, this refeshingly concise podcast is consistently approachable and engaging."
2463,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Couldn‚Äôt Ask for a Better History of Science and Engineering Podcast,5,"Have been listening for years, and John Lienhard is still going strong!"
2464,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Shameless oil sponsor ship.,1,I‚Äôve been listing to this podcast for almost a decade and deleted it from my feed today. It‚Äôs a science podcast that now has an oil industry sponsor. Helping global warming on a science podcast is despicable. Goodbye.
2465,Engines of Our Ingenuity,A magic and necessary part of every day,5,"From the heart, to the heart."
2466,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Houston radio's hidden gem,5,"I grew up listening to this every morning, and it always gave me a sense of wonder for innovation. I still get chills listening to it now; as an adult, I can better appreciate the more abstract pieces on history, philosophy, and human mechanics. It is as well-scripted as any radiolab or invisibilia episode and packs both an incredible childlike curiosity and a systematic analysis into a shockingly short monologue. John Lienhard has certainly left a legacy in this series."
2467,Engines of Our Ingenuity,I look forward to every new episode,5,this is one of the first podcasts I check for updates
2468,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Bold and factual,5,Good discussion of vital topics.
2469,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Well written,5,Good podcast about technology and it's interaction with human life.
2470,Engines of Our Ingenuity,The intersection of Engineering and Everything,5,"Dr. Lienhard‚Äôs program is well written, insightful, and a tribute to its staff. In the tradition of the five ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äùs, it digs deeper into the intersection of science and our lives, otherwise known as engineering, and brings out the humans behind our stuff."
2471,Engines of Our Ingenuity,"Terrific ""driveway"" moments",5,"Engines has aired on KUHF in Houston for many years and I've always wanted a way to retrieve the most interesting episodes to play for my literature students at a local college. The best ""engines"" blend science, engineering, art, music, literature, and common sense into quirky tales that illuminate the best of our human interaction with the world in history and today."
2472,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Highly recommended,5,"Dr. Lienhard's program is a compelling and interesting look into the history of technology and its impact on our lives. I'm aware of no other program like it, and it's not to be missed!"
2473,Engines of Our Ingenuity,The Best Few Minutes of My Day,5,"I have been listening to ""Engines"" for several years, and I do everything I can to hear it every day. Dr.Lienhard's ability to clearly show us how science, invention, art, literature, history, and our present all intermingle to form the world we are in today, as well as our future, always fascinates me. Dr. Lienhard has the same vision as many of the figures he so sincerely admires. Listen to just one of these episodes, and you will be not only hooked, but educated. Bravo, Dr. Lienhard! Bravo!"
2474,Engines of Our Ingenuity,"Making connections, uncovering history",5,"Excellent, short and regular podcast from John Lienhard,looking at the history of scientific advancement and looking at the seeds of creative individuals and ideas."
2475,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Wow!,5,"In the olden days--before podcasts--I was always thrilled when I happened to catch this show on one of the local public FM stations. So I'm especially thrilled that I can now pick it up regularly as a podcast. John Lienhard has a knack for putting invention and discovery into context and giving it a human face, and has developed the rare skill of telling charming and tremendously interesting stories in very short periods of time. Thank you Dr. Lienhard, thank you University of Houston, thank you KUHF, and thank you iTunes for bringing these to us!"
2476,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Ingenious!,5,Ingenious indeed.
2477,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Believe it or not -- A family tradition,5,"On and off for 15 years I've been taking a break at 12:05 to listen to Engines of Our Ingenuity on my hometown radio station. When I moved away to college, my father taped them for me, and they would take up the first few hours of the long drives between home and school. When I moved to St. Louis, I listen to Engines online every day I can; if I'm away, Dad gets me a number so I can listen later. My kids (3rd grade and kindergarten) have their own favorite episodes. I love being able to sit for four minutes and learn something every single day. Thanks to everybody at the University of Houston and KUHF for their support of Engines."
2478,Engines of Our Ingenuity,Excellent By Any Measure,5,"I listen to this show on my morning drive to work when my schedule fits and then catch up with episodes I've missed via podcast, usually while I'm traveling. Dr. Leinhard has a knack for picking interesting subjects related to science and engineering and then sharing remarkable depth and background on the topic in a few short minutes. I've yet to listen to an EoOI episode that didn't teach me something I didn't know, and I've been listening for years."
2479,Engines of Our Ingenuity,No longer available,5,"This was an excellent podcast, but it is no longer available. Checking his site, it seems that Dr. John Lienhard's episodes are all produced as M3Us now.
This is strange, as M3Us simply contain a path to a MP3. Why the decision to block out podcast listeners from this show is a puzzling one."
2480,"Lab Values Podcast (Nursing Podcast, normal lab values for nurses for NCLEX¬Æ) by NRSNG",Wonderful,5,"These podcasts have been invaluable to studying for nursing school! They're encouraging and easy to understand. I can play them in the car while I'm travelling, at the gym while I'm working out, or just working around the house. Love them."
2481,"Lab Values Podcast (Nursing Podcast, normal lab values for nurses for NCLEX¬Æ) by NRSNG","NRSNG is exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered!",5,"Thank you so much for creating these podcasts, your hard work is appreciated! The NRSNG program is a tremendous gift for all future nurses, it's exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered! I can't wait to see you on the other side and call you my colleague. ~ FUTURE RN"
2482,"Lab Values Podcast (Nursing Podcast, normal lab values for nurses for NCLEX¬Æ) by NRSNG",Thank you,5,These are all wonderful! I wish there were more--mix em up!
2483,"Lab Values Podcast (Nursing Podcast, normal lab values for nurses for NCLEX¬Æ) by NRSNG",Thank you,5,"I think it‚Äôs easy for some of us nurses to become lazy and forget important clinical information. Especially true if we don‚Äôt use it as often as a critical care nurse would. This, and Jon‚Äôs other podcasts reminds me that it is important to stay sharp and constantly challenged with current information as well as brushed up on the basics that I learned (sort of) in nursing school. Thanks for this!"

2490,Space,Dead White Europeans...,1,... is how the record on the Voyager spacecraft was described! Shut up BBC! Just shut up about everything.
2491,Space,Loved,5,"I absolutely loved this podcast, very interesting and informative! Please make more!!"
2492,Space,Space knows no borders,4,"I think the episodes are actually pretty interesting. They run the gamete from basic to moderately deep in terms of technicality. Sometimes I wish they were a little more in depth. I would also like to hear the stories that don't get told in the day to day press. Like hearing about a collision or saved just in time. How about how difficult it is getting for the US to send people to space on Russian rockets? I don't ever want to hear UFO or extra terrestrial stories. I like the international angle as well. Keep up the quality work, BBC!"
2493,This Week I Learned,Too Feminist.,1,Would like this podcast but the narrator can‚Äôt keep from expressing feminist views. I don‚Äôt mind a fair analysis but do not favor opinionated accounts.
2494,This Week I Learned,Love your podcast,5,"Hi! You have the best kind of crazy weird podcast but you can still be surprised by the zigzag things and I also like how you can learn from the past
Hi I‚Äôm just writing this because"
2495,This Week I Learned,"Minimum commitment, maximum take away",5,This podcast is a pleasure to listen to and you don‚Äôt have to wade through any blah blah blah to get to the pay off. You learn what was learned before you know it and you‚Äôre not left asking yourself pertinent questions about the facility or the validity of the knowledge. The host has a pleasant voice and makes an immediate connection with listeners.
2496,This Week I Learned,Awesome!,5,Great information and easily digestible!
2497,This Week I Learned,Personal Bias Taints Podcast,2,"Another podcast from a far left, feminist journalist looking for her 15 minutes of fame. Research on topics covered is occasionally lacking and sources are never adequately cited. Ms. Hansen‚Äôs political and social views spill over into the topics covered which ruin the podcast (for me). I love the concept. If they were to get a different host, I‚Äôd probably give it another go. I really tried to like this podcast. If you want informational, mind-stimulating podcasts that are light and funny, check out the HowStuffWorks podcasts. I find them fair, balanced, and well researched. This week I learned what podcast to avoid."
2498,This Week I Learned,My favorite weekly podcast!,5,"Not the best party soundtrack, though. Why?"
2499,This Week I Learned,Nice break from politics.. most of the time,5,Please God stay out of politics
2500,This Week I Learned,Please Do Your Research First,1,For the last several months I have listened to this podcast and found it entertaining. Today I started to listen to Ms. Hansen‚Äôs podcast about low carb diets (a subject for which I have fair knowledge) and she immediately equated a low carb diet with an exclusively high protein diet. She is so wrong that I could not finish the podcast from the mischaracterization...the same load of garbage the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association have buried the public. My question try counting the number of deaths from following the AHA and ADA recommendations. I was almost one of the body count. DO YOUR RESEARCH FIRST!
2501,This Week I Learned,Sloppy !,2,"Hansen appears unqualified to report on science. After gagging through her report on ""nucular"" energy -- the word is NU CLE AR -- I decided to give her more time. Then she had Capt Cook ""circumVENTing"" the globe! Nuff said."
2502,This Week I Learned,I save each episode!,5,Topics cover a variety of areas of life. Great!
2503,This Week I Learned,"Witty, pithy",5,Always interesting

2516,This Week I Learned,"Quick, Interesting and Diverse Topics",5,I always learn something new that I haven't read or heard about elsewhere. The podcast is short enough that it's easy to keep up with and has great variety in the topics presented. I almost always get online afterwards to learn more or to send something I heard to a friend.

2527,This Week in Microbiology,Specialist knowledge made accessible,5,"Without dumbing down, or being patronizing to non-microbiologists, this podcast manages to educate and inform."
2528,This Week in Microbiology,Just found this treasure trove,5,This is truly a great listen for scientists interested in microbiology. Dives into diverse subjects with an eye-leveled discussion. Almost feels like you‚Äôre having a nice discussion over beer at the end of a conference.
2529,This Week in Microbiology,Microbes are so cool,5,"Most times while listening to this podcast I think to myself ""That is so awesome, how did I never know this before? I am not even surprised though"""
2530,This Week in Microbiology,This is amazing,5,First and foremost thank you for the great work that you do. I am going slowly through your podcasts (a lot to chew on). I was wondering if you would consider reviewing another mycology podcasts given the recent surge of super bug Candida strains.
2531,This Week in Microbiology,True Science Entertainment and Resource,5,"Hi TWiM team!
I want to say thank you for your dedication and service in science education and outreach! As a student of science I value the material presented here and on all of the TWiX podcasts. I also have a passion for education and outreach myself and admire your work to spread the good word in our field. I enjoy the journal club style of presenting here but also the personal touches of ‚Äòpics‚Äô and even the quirky weather forecast, and additionally the comments on careers in science.
I feel this podcast is another guide on my journey and found it recently very helpful in my graduate school application process. In preparing for interviews, I enjoyed listening to TWiM, TWiV and TWiP to familiarize myself with work of professors I was interviewing with and found the content a great benefit for this! I am grateful to share that it payed off, and I will be joining the lab of Dr. Janelle Ayres at the Salk Institute as a graduate student working towards a PhD from UCSD!
Thank you Professor Racaniello and TWiM team! I encourage anyone interested in science (and not just microbiology) to listen!
Best Regards,
Alexandria Schieber"
2532,This Week in Microbiology,Endlessly fascinating,5,I‚Äôve only just discovered this podcast and I can‚Äôt get enough. Thank you for making this available to the lay person! I wish I had paid more attention in science classes and pursued this fascinating field of study.
2533,This Week in Microbiology,Great summaries,5,Great way to hear about diverse topics and I prefer listening to reading in many cases
2534,This Week in Microbiology,Science as it should sound,5,"Outstanding podcast describing latest new papers and reviews in microbiology. The skill and genuine interest and enthusiasm of participants make this podcast interesting and educational for an audience expanding far beyond the experts in microbiology. I am not a microbilogist myself (have degree in physics), but got hooked.
Thank you Vincent, Michael, Elio and everyone!"
2535,This Week in Microbiology,A great science podcast!,5,"If you like this podcast, check out ""This Week in Virology"" and ""This Week in Parasitology"" also from Dr. Racaniello and friends."
2536,This Week in Microbiology,Great Show,5,High level science that is entertaining as well.
2537,This Week in Microbiology,I am not a scientist but.....,5,"...I listen to these, (TWIM, TWIP and TWIM) on Science360 as much as I can. Sure a lot of the time I am not familiar with the topics but I still enjoy listening and I am learning a lot...amazing. I really like these 'shows'."

2540,This Week in Microbiology,One of my favourite podcasts,5,"I have been listening to TWiM since its inception, and it has consistently been a well-produced, interesting, and engaging podcast. Vincent Racaniello and the other contributors regularly produce high-quality and informative episodes that have made me a long-term listener."
2541,This Week in Microbiology,Even better than TWIV,5,"...because I guess bacteria are more inherently accessible than viruses? In any event, I find that I understand more in this podcast than I do in TWIV. Again, the hosts here have a great commitment to science and to their audience, and I learn something every time. Michelle and Elio are particularly wonderful, though everyone is truly excellent."
2542,This Week in Microbiology,Amazing resource!,5,Dr. Racaniello et al. run an amazing podcast covering a host of topics. As a Microbiology undergraduate student I look forward to his podcasts weekly and consider them the best part of my morning.

Greetings from a raving fan in beautiful and amazing Taipei, Taiwan."
2547,This Week in Microbiology,I started my TWiX habit on TWiM,5,"You can't get more diverse, informative, and sometimes jaw-dropping than what the world of microbes provides. If only it were easier to understand. IT IS. Right here. Friendly conversational discussions of some of the most interesting things to evolve on planet Earth. Very novice-friendly."
2548,This Week in Microbiology,I LOVE TWiM,5,"I love this podcast and all the others in the ""TWi"" series!"

Impacting people with positivity so flipping cool!"
2565,Live Happy Now,Life Changing,5,"I recommend this podcast to everyone who will listen! (Literally). It's all positive psychology, research based, scientific evidence on concepts to be a happier person. A lot of it revolves on positive psychology, which includes a lot of gratitude, mindfulness, forgiveness, & self awareness. The only complaint I have is that each guest on the show is typically promoting the book they've written or have wrote & it's great to know, but I'm not listening to hear about your book. I'm trying to get a 25 minute dose of how to make my life better! This isn't the main focus, but just something I've noticed. There was also an episode on politics & I thought it was so pointless, but I just skipped that one since I'm not into that stuff. Overall, very life changing podcast!"
2566,Live Happy Now,Refreshing!!,5,"These podcasts are so refreshing to fill my listening time with versus the alternatives...news reports trot some time now have emphasized the drama and negatives in this world and life that so many of us have a tendency to forget all the positives and happiness in this world!

2583,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Space Stuff nuf said,5,It's a quickie but completely cool. A lovely reminder of the glorious universe we live in and that some people out there are doing amazing things.
2584,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,excellent,5,"I love music, but I love listening to these too. Space is so cool!"
2585,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,It's a Wonder!,4,Some great content presented here along with a rare glance into the complete lack of organization within NASA as evident by the inconsistent branding in the videos and naming of files. It would be most helpful to put someone with media/publishing experience in charge of creating a consistent look and presentation. It's truly a wonder that NASA has achieved so much with this type of chaos going on behind the scenes.
2586,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Short and Sweet,4,Longer audio and videos can be found on the NASA Web sites. This podcast gives some nice quick audios and videos on current and past missions. Space is so cool.
2587,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,not good,1,hated it
2588,Podcast for audio and video - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,love the info,5,love to here about the info about planes
2589,Speaking of Psychology,Very Informative!,5,"I really enjoy listening to these podcasts - an easy listen with lots of great, but easy to process, information!"
2590,Speaking of Psychology,About Coronavirus in Wuhan in China,5,"First of all I want to address my deep appreciation to the amazing Speaking of Psychology. I have been a long time listener and always love your contents. As a psy major graduate, I am deeply appreciated that there is still a place for me to keep in touch with Psychology.
I love how you guys keep the topics up to date with current popular issues around the world which is why I want to kindly point out some ‚Äúmissed‚Äù information in the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù episode.
I am a native Chinese and currently living in the mainland China so I happen to have relatively more information about what‚Äôs going on in Wuhan than some who‚Äôs living outside China.
1.WUHAN IS NOT ‚ÄúSHUT DOWN‚Äù LIKE LITERALLY ‚ÄúSHUT DOWN‚Äù. The central government is merely prohibiting any regular Wuhan citizens from going outside the city because they have the potential to spread the virus around. (Actually I don‚Äôt see the difference between ‚Äúthis‚Äù and the policy that other countries like the US banned travelers from China to come in)
2. The whole nation(China) is sending their best medical groups from all over the country to Wuhan. Well-Developed cities like Shanghai, Beijing has sent countless medical teams and the whole nation‚Äôs citizens are voluntary raising fundings to purchase medical supplies like N95 mask/surgical mask or donating these medical supplies to Wuhan directly. (Because of the collectivism culture nature, everyone wants to do their part to support those in need. Countless food companies are voluntary sending food supplies. Even regular citizens in Wuhan are voluntary doing carpools to provide transportation to medical groups.)
3. They are also building two hospitals from scratch in Wuhan that can provide immediate medical care to patients in Wuhan. They are called ÁÅ´Á•ûÂ±±(The god of fire mountain) and Èõ∑Á•ûÂ±±(the god of thunder mountain).
The ‚Äúfire god‚Äù was already completed and is capable of admitting up to 1000 patients(the whole construction only took 10 days). The ‚Äúthunder god‚Äù is still under construction but will be completed soon and can admit up to 1500 patients.
Thus, Wuhan is getting the help from all over the country, the government is not simply shutting down the city, they are sending the best medical groups that the whole nation can provide to rescue people in need.
So I would say, as panicking it might be for some remained healthy people in Wuhan, NOBODY is cutting them lose. The whole nation is trying their best to support them.
As for other parts in China. Schools(all education institutions) are shut down, students are streaming classes online at home. People are all trying to avoid going out in public as much as possible.
These are just some of my takeaways but I would be more than happy if any of these information can help clear some misunderstandings towards what‚Äôs happening in Wuhan in China."
2591,Speaking of Psychology,Thank you,5,"I listened to the podcast on hoarding and came away with a different view of my family. Learning there is a pattern with chromosome 14 did a lot to ease my troubled mind. I can‚Äôt stand the mess and it has led to me not visiting and holding bitter feeling towards my family. I am guilty of thinking they love their stuff more than they love me. Since learning of the chromosomal component, I see the situation in a new light. I want to thank you for the resources provided in the episode. It really could be the key to mending a broken family."
2592,Speaking of Psychology,Not cool.,1,"I was appalled by episode 97 implying that making yourself hungry is a ‚Äúsign of burning fat‚Äù as the speaker was discussing the possible discomforts of behavior change. As an upcoming professional in the nutrition + dietetic field with a dual degree in psychology, this is extremely upsetting. Please stop encouraging listeners to starve themselves. And yes, this includes fat listeners. Just because someone is fat does not mean it‚Äôs okay for them to go hungry. You should be ashamed of yourself for contributing to diet culture. Please stick to your scope of practice, which I‚Äôm sure is not nutrition + dietetics :). (This is intended for the guest speaker + not necessarily the whole podcast.)
If you‚Äôre reading this + you‚Äôre tired of being at war with your body, I highly recommend the book Intuitive Eating by Evelyn Tribole + Elyse Resch."
2593,Speaking of Psychology,Love starting off my day with this podcast!,5,I instantly feel relief from these episodes.
2594,Speaking of Psychology,boring,1,not interesting
2595,Speaking of Psychology,Happy,5,Thank you for each and every episode. Keep them coming
2596,Speaking of Psychology,Love this podcast,4,I love this podcast. I‚Äôm one of those people who really likes psychology and I‚Äôd tried a few podcast but they weren‚Äôt that good however I really like this one
2597,Speaking of Psychology,Dopamine,5,This podcast was SO interesting!!! I learned a ton!
2598,Speaking of Psychology,Great podcast now get better!,5,Love the podcasts. Would like to see it advance and be an in studio environment vs Skype or whatever they are currently doing. I think a lot of these topics could be much more interesting at the 2-3 hour range.
2599,Speaking of Psychology,I like it,5,awesome stuff
2600,Speaking of Psychology,"Good Information, O.K. Podcast",5,"This podcast basically gives an overview of either emerging issues within certain fields in psychology or details specific trends which have been found in a specific sub field of psychology such as clinical or developmental psychology. The information presented is actually very good and it is interesting to hear about new practices being used within the field or new discoveries. My only con is that the episodes have become so infrequent that I have to question whether such a concept was a good idea for a podcast. Unlike other educational/research podcasts which release episodes once a month, this one does not seem to have a set frequency."
2601,Speaking of Psychology,"Interesting podcast, annoying host tic",3,"I enjoy the podcast but it drives me insane that the host is constantly going ""mhm"" and making small noises under her breath. It really distracts from the guest speaker."
2602,Speaking of Psychology,Great Review,5,Listen to this Bruce Wamphold is awesome! Save you money 5-6 sessions of therapy!! Is what you need!!
2603,Speaking of Psychology,I honestly don‚Äôt appreciate the guests bias.,5,"I noticed immediately that she was basically taking the responsibility away from the adults and I believe that the economical factors were not given enough credence by her. The main reason we are all frenzied to work constantly and to the bone, is because of the economy having been rigged against the 80%. It‚Äôs not surprising that the scammers were doing what they were, it was surprising that they got caught and it seems like they‚Äôre going to actually get in some trouble even though they are super rich. I wish y‚Äôall would‚Äôve talked more about the effects of scams like this on p.o.c who are inherently at a disadvantage in comparison to rich white ppl."
2604,Speaking of Psychology,Dopamine ‚Äúprogramming or pushing a button is NOT easier‚Äù,4,"Having an IOF infantry Marine Corps veteran as a husband and working with many military and veteran clients I can tell you there is NOT a moral disconnect between those who push bomb buttons or run drones and infantry. Whether you‚Äôre shooting a child that‚Äôs coming at you with IEDs strapped to her or your blowing up a building you just saw a child walk into, emotionally you conscious mind stores that as a moral failing. There is no choice is war. You do what your told. You do what you have to to protect your brothers and sisters. But the emotion impact is the same as pushing the guy in front of the train. Button or no button. A lot of work has to be done to repair that trauma."
2605,Speaking of Psychology,Loving this podcast,5,"I‚Äôm a new listener, I‚Äôve listened to the podcast of 2019. I noticed the ones before were fairly short ranging from 8-19 minutes. Definitely keep the 45 minutes to a hour. I love this podcast, so much information and great to keep my brain going during summer! Thank you for all you do!"
2606,Speaking of Psychology,Finding meaning in your life,5,"I am a new listener to the podcast and enjoyed listening to episode #75, How to Find Meaning in Life. As someone who helps people get ""unstuck"" in their lives and in their relationships, I deeply resonated with this episode and look forward to tuning into more. Shira Gura (The Getting Unstuck Podcast)"
2607,Speaking of Psychology,Dopamine triggering,5,"I work in the behavioral health field and this podcast challenges me, continues to intrigue me, and has real life implications. I love that the newer episodes are longer. Thanks for sharing and taking the time to interview various specialists."
2608,Speaking of Psychology,Love and hate,3,"First of all I love your podcast and I believe your topics are great üëçüèº, the best, inspiring, educational.
And I wish that your recent guest would stop sucking or chewing something. It is very disturbing and it doesn‚Äôt sound appropriate. I know that there might be a possibility of him being sick or something but..... I am sorry I can‚Äôt bear üêª to listen anymore.
I know that‚Äôs just my opinion about this guest speaker. I should move on. I wish you‚Äôll have another like.
Have a great day!"
2609,Best of Natural History Radio,Same Issue as Prairie_Dog,2,"I would so love to be able to listen to the new episodes, but unfortunately everything after the Planet Puffin series (which was fantastic) will not play on Apple Podcast. Please remedy, for the sake of the iPhone owners across the pond who need us some BBC nature!"
2610,Best of Natural History Radio,Often Will Not Download or Stream - BBC Support Does Not Care,1,"I am finally unsubscribing to this otherwise excellent podcast because the BBC can‚Äôt seem to make it work on iTunes/Apple Podcasts. About half the time, a new episode will appear, and I‚Äôll get excited. However, when I try to download or stream it, it gives a ‚Äúunable to download‚Äù and ‚Äútemporarily unavailable‚Äù error message. For a while, I faithfully reported this to the BBC via their website, with screenshots, and tried all the troubleshooting methods possible. Each time they said I could listen to it in the web or via iPlayer so it wasn‚Äôt a problem. If listeners cannot listen to your podcast via the most popular pod-catcher in the world, it would appear you have a problem you should fix. This does not concern the BBC however, so I‚Äôm unfortunately giving up on this podcast. I advise you to save yourself the frustration and find another program you can actually access via your iDevice."
2611,Best of Natural History Radio,Love this podcast!,5,One of my favorites!
2612,Best of Natural History Radio,Top drawer!,5,"This series is superb on all fronts. Great stories, excellent production. Radio at it's finest. If you are a fan of natural history, this series of ~200 podcast is a real treat. Reminds one of how good radio can be, and how bad most TV has become..."
2613,Best of Natural History Radio,Spectacular,5,"Wonderful podcast,. Only wish they were longer."
2614,Best of Natural History Radio,The podcast that dares to record inside a yew tree. . .,5,"This is a brilliant podcast that addresses significant issues in ecology, natural history, evolutionary biology, and nature preservation.
It is also just the slightest bit dotty.
It did really once broadcast from inside a yew tree. The show was about commensual living and the fungi that helped the yew tree exploit the trapped carbon resources in its own trunk!!
And that's not even the strangest one.
Great science.
Vividly explained.
It's remotely possible that television could ruin the whole thing. Subscribe now before some cable channel remakes the series. You won't be sorry."
2615,Best of Natural History Radio,Saving species,5,I just love to listen and share their delight and obvious love for the natural world In a class all by itself
2616,Best of Natural History Radio,Science in the Wild,5,I love hearing scientists in the field exploring nature. Not being there myself just makes me angry. At least I have this podcast for now.
2617,Best of Natural History Radio,Great Podcast,5,One of my favorte podcasts!
2618,Best of Natural History Radio,Wonderful stuff,5,"I also loved this podcast. It was good at sharing information about the natural world and the enthusiasm of the presenters and experts was palpable. It also had a bit of a 'soap opera' quality in terms of the regular updates of the adventures of our migrating friends, but that's what made it fun to tune in every week. I hope this podcast is renewed. I want to find out more about our flying and furry friends!"
2619,Best of Natural History Radio,I'm First?,5,"This was fantastic. I can't believe you don't have a million reviews. I now have milk weed growing in my back yard and you know why. Thanks from an avid listener to all your casts.
Chuck from New England (USA)"
2620,Surgery 101,Great resource for surgery clerkship,5,The podcast reviews what you need to know. Helped me a question or two from my attendings/residents and helped me ask them good follow up questions. Info here lined up w/ Pestana‚Äôs and Recall.
2621,Surgery 101,When i used it for the first time it was good,1,Now suddenly not all episodes available and you get multiple types of podcasts not related to surgery
2622,Surgery 101,Short and helpful,5,"Surgery intern here, and I love this podcast. Short, to the point, interesting, and teaches me something every time."
2623,Surgery 101,Helpful for long drives for this student,5,"PA student in surgery, quite helpful to listen to when driving or when I'm tired of reading. Extremely happy this exists and have recommended it to classmates.

---For the authors:
Content is fantastic! Thank you so much for concise, to the point information. Very organized. Sometimes the sounds and music in between sections are excessive and I skip ahead, although most of the time the little check mark sounds are helpful since they bullet point the key ideas. Can be overdone...
Some guest speakers are better than others. For instance, sometimes I can't help but roll my eyes when Danica is being corny and speaks as if she's talking to children. However at least she never sounds monotone and keeps me awake. One speaker (I can't remember his name) speaks in such a monotone, it's hard to pay attention or want to keep listening. Thanks for putting together such an awesome podcast!!"
2624,Surgery 101,great!,5,keep up the awesome work!
2625,Surgery 101,Great info but annoying sound effects,4,"As a PA student, I listened to this while driving back and forth to my general surgery rotation site every day. It has a lot of good info, and it really helped me study during the 40-minute commute. However, it has some really annoying sound effects that are very distracting. The ambulance sirens are particularly inappropriate and distracting while driving and would make me stop and look for the ambulance while on the commute. Even when I listened to it while not driving, things like children cheering or applause would distract me from my train of thought while studying. Before I could consider giving this a 5/5, those sound effects would have to go."
2626,Surgery 101,High Rating from Potential Patient,4,"From a civilian's standpoint the contents sound useful. They help me understand what surgeons do, and need in order to do their work, the variety of specialties and the parts of the process. I got thru the first 100 so far and only find fault with many of the music inserts, primarily those that are louder than the body and start/stop without fade in/out. High school students with an interest in medicine should hear these and anyone else with an interest in specific areas, such as shock or hip fractures. Thanks to all those who made an extra effort to put the series together."
2627,Surgery 101,Interesting,4,I really like the information but the sound effects are really distracting and could be dispensed with.
2628,Surgery 101,Great for any med student,5,"I listen to this podcast in between lectures or study breaks as a way to keep the massive amount of material in Year 1 of med school in perspective. It's nice to think that all of the information in the books will be applied, and this podcast gives a good idea of what to expect in the coming years. It would be great to have some tips for the early 1st/2nd year students to help prepare for rotations (either surgical or in general).
I also agree the music throughout at times can be a bit harsh.
All things considered, this is possibly the best podcast for medical students!"
2629,Surgery 101,Excellent,5,"Perfect surgery clerkship companion, very relevant and high yield surgical topics. Focused and concise. Keep them coming...waiting for a lec on renal masses!"
2630,Surgery 101,Surgery 101,5,Surgery 101 is a great resource for medical students on general surgery service.
2631,Surgery 101,Not bad.,4,"The information is nice, but the music between chapters is too loud! Please normalize the volume and these will be great!"
2632,Surgery 101,Very good podcast!,5,"I've really enjoyed listening to this podcast. Very informative, right-to-the-point podcast! Highly recommend!"
2633,Surgery 101,Excellent overview,4,Short and to the point. Great for students looking for some highlights on a commute. Would love to hear more of these.
2634,Surgery 101,Awesome,5,I'm a PA student on my Surgery rotation and this podcast has been immensely helpful!
2635,Weekly Infusion,Informative and critical!,5,I am not finished with the whole series but the first 4 episodes are amazing. So much detail and critical thinking went into this. There is a lot of blame to go around and this series shows who is responsible/how this happened and is still happening. A must listen!
2636,Weekly Infusion,Great podcast,5,Dr Drew thank you for doing this podcast I‚Äôve learned so much and really appreciate I‚Äôm currently separated and these episodes have been incredibly helpful. Keep up the passion and great work thank you very much
2637,Weekly Infusion,Lack of empathy,3,I enjoy this podcast but sometimes the host is really rude to the callers (namely on the Predator episode.) He has zero empathy for the callers (specifically the one with agoraphobia and the one who called about women being able to dress like they want.) I couldn‚Äôt believe this guy was in any field of helping people. One guy on the episode was super gentle and understanding but the main guy shocked me with his lack of empathy.
2638,Weekly Infusion,Great Medical Podcast!!,5,"Have always loved Dr.Drew, now enjoy listening to Dr. Bruce as well!!
Thanks for sharing some of your knowledge!! Really enjoy!"
2639,Weekly Infusion,Great,5,I love all things Dr. Drew and have to agree. Its nice to hear both Dr. Drew and Bruce be able to finish sentences. Educational and entertaining.
2640,Weekly Infusion,It‚Äôs got Dr. Drew what else do you need?,5,Except for more episodes please!
2641,Weekly Infusion,Dr.Deuce and Dr.Spaz in one Podcast? No thanks,2,Dr.Deuce and Dr.Spaz in one Podcast? No thanks
2642,Weekly Infusion,When is the show returning?,5,"Loved it, want it to come back."
2643,Weekly Infusion,"Dr. Drew, please stop interrupting!",3,"I really enjoy the content of this podcast and they have some fascinating stories, but Dr. Drew frequently interrupts guests and it drives me crazy!! There was one time I was really interested to hear what someone had to say but he interrupted with another question and we never got to hear the rest of the original answer! He clearly also doesn‚Äôt get the feedback from iTunes reviews since people have been saying the same thing for months."
2644,Weekly Infusion,Great Topics,5,"I‚Äôm not a Dr., so some of the terms require a Google search, but I enjoy the challenge. The cancer research developments discussed are amazing. Keep it up guys!"
2645,Weekly Infusion,Nice work,5,Interesting show keep
2646,Weekly Infusion,Entertaining and educational,5,Great podcast! Really interesting to hear different opinions from two brilliant physicians and their fascinating guests. Educational for anyone in medicine or people who just want to hear honest information and the thinking behind medical decisions.
2647,Weekly Infusion,Heartwarming story,5,Truly inspiring story of the power of love and the resilience of life.
2648,Weekly Infusion,Finally,5,Great to hear these two talk seriously without interruption.
2649,Weekly Infusion,So far so good,5,"I love Dr. Drew and I am hoping to see Dr. Bruce's understanding of Borderline Personality Disorder catch up to the latest research out of McLean hospital that shows Borderline can remit after years of proper treatment. Dr. Bruce filled in for Drew on Loveline one day and spoke about Borderlines in the most unfair, disparaging and cruel way. I was really horrified but sadly, not surprised. ER doctors like Dr. Bruce treat borderlines like the spawn of Satan and perpetuate negative stigma. I hope his understanding of the disorder matures. Other than that I really like him!"
2650,Weekly Infusion,All good things,5,Together Drew and Bruce are a brilliant super power.
2651,Weekly Infusion,Great Pod,5,"Latest episode should have been titled Drew's humble opinion. I enjoy this podcast a lot. It's nice to hear Drew and Bruce without Adam in the the background (or foreground) ready to errupt. Love Adam, but sometimes he is a deterent to the message."
2652,Weekly Infusion,Budding medical student,5,Love the show. As an aspiring physician I find it very informative and inspiring.
2653,Weekly Infusion,Brain food,5,"Love this show, so far every topic and guest has introduced me to a topic that I have found interesting or directly relevant to my experience. Drew and Bruce make it very easy to follow along even if you aren't that medically versed. A+"
2654,Weekly Infusion,Could be 5 star,4,"I'll say the same thing as many here. Dr. Drew interrupting guests does get annoying. I can look past it thinking that he gets so into and excited with certain topics and guests, his mind is going a mile a minute he just cant help himself! Ive always enjoyed everything he's done but this genre seems to fit him perfectly. The banter between him and Bruce can get comical.i dont even mind the adds, he makes them personal and interesting. One of my fav pod casts."
2655,Weekly Infusion,If you like mansplaining...,1,"...you'll love this podcast. I, however, am sick of listening to privileged white men interrupting their intelligent female guests and acting quite insulting towards them. Writer and former attorney, Ayelet Waldman actually handled it really well (I would have lost my sh!#...let her finish talking for crying out loud!!!). Unfortunately, this M.D. got too sick of the mansplaining about 5 minutes into the episode and had to stop listening and unsubscribe. I highly recommend Waldman's book: ""A Really Good Day"". If you're going to have guests on your show, consider showing them the courtesy of allowing them to speak without rude interruptions...I find it strange that the hosts don't do this to their male guests as noticeably. The subject matter of the show is great, but I refuse to continue to support these types of men."
2656,Weekly Infusion,Only one complaint,4,"I'm a fan of all of Drew's podcast. As a nurse, I really appreciate an entire podcast dedicated to science and medicine. My only complaint is the amount Drew interrupts his guests. Sometimes the conversation sounds more like a casual dinner conversation and less of an interview. I've really enjoyed the guests they've had on the show, and would love to hear more of what they have to say.
Also, I was so excited to see Mrs. Angemi on the show! I've been following her for a while now, and love what she is doing!"
2657,Weekly Infusion,Informative and essential,5,^^^^^^^
2658,Weekly Infusion,Dr. Annie and Dave Pelzer,5,Dr. Annie was great and super informative!! Dave Pelzer seemed a bit detached from reality or something was kinda off. He seems like a really nice guy but just a bit detached. Keep up the good work!!!
2659,Weekly Infusion,Refreshing,5,"I love Adam Carolla, but it's great to hear Dr. Drew be able to talk unobstructed. Dr. Bruce is great also."
2660,Weekly Infusion,Dr. Drew and Dr. Spaz!,5,Great information on a broad range of medical subjects.
2661,Weekly Infusion,"Real Physicians, Real Help",5,Thank you both for offering your knowledge to us. You are providing a public service.
2662,Weekly Infusion,Mansplaining at its finest,3,"I really enjoy this podcast and the subject matter is interesting, but I almost shut it off halfway through Nicole Angemi's episode. They constantly interrupted her or would try to explain things for her, which was patronizing. If they were interviewing a man, would they have done the same thing? If you think you know more than the guests you bring on the show, why invite them in the first place?"
2663,Weekly Infusion,Very informative!,5,"I love listening to your Podcast, Drs. Drew and Bruce. I find it mentally stimulating. I started listening to your podcasts about a one ago and have listened to all. I look forward to your new episodes every week. I thank you for your enlightening show."
2664,Weekly Infusion,Great Pod,5,I really enjoy hearing the Docs get together and riff on whatever is going on in the moment. Thank you.
2665,Nursing Mnemonics Show by NRSNG (Memory Tricks for Nursing School),Podcasts,3,Very monotone and hard to listen too. Good info just pretty dry.
2666,Nursing Mnemonics Show by NRSNG (Memory Tricks for Nursing School),Amazing,5,Thank you for this!
2667,Nursing Mnemonics Show by NRSNG (Memory Tricks for Nursing School),John,5,Wow this is an amazing podcast !! Was recommended on YouTube.
2668,Nursing Mnemonics Show by NRSNG (Memory Tricks for Nursing School),"NRSNG is exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered!",5,"Thank you so much for creating these podcasts, your hard work is appreciated! The NRSNG program is a tremendous gift for all future nurses, it's exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered! I can't wait to see you on the other side and call you my colleague. ~ FUTURE RN"
2669,Nursing Mnemonics Show by NRSNG (Memory Tricks for Nursing School),Really helps,5,Looking forward to listening to this podcast!! Good thing I listened to the latest podcast that they have new podcast shows. I'm so happy! I can listen when I drive or go to sleep. Great way to kill time. Please keep it up!! Thank you!! NRSNG!
2670,UpToDate Talk,.,3,Papers reviewed are always pertinent but reviews themselves aren‚Äôt particularly objective or critical
2671,UpToDate Talk,Internal Med needs all the help I can get!,5,Awesome quick pertinent overviews. UpToDate is my favorite.......
2672,UpToDate Talk,Thanks from an internist,5,"I found this podcast just browsing, and I am so glad I did! The content is very useful in help managing patients in my day to day practice. Dr.Nancy Sokol makes the conversation so much fun, she asks just the right questions, looking forward to hear the next one....!"
2673,UpToDate Talk,UpToDate,5,Excellent!
2674,UpToDate Talk,Up to Date,5,"Excellent presentations,well organized.Perfect length for my round trip commute."
2675,UpToDate Talk,Best of my feed,5,"As a recently graduated physician, very much still in training, I find these talks a must for anyone wanting to stay updated in a tight schedule. The bimonthly releases feature outstanding physicians from all over the place, who are very adept at summarizing topics of interest and providing in-depth explanation of practice-changing research papers in the context of real life practice issues. The host guides the conversation with concise interviewing and clarification, and the overall production makes for an easily digestible podcast. My main complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt come out more often.
I highly recommend this!"
2676,UpToDate Talk,Excellent,5,Very informative and excellent discussions and recommendations from the experts.
2677,UpToDate Talk,Good podcast but can improve,4,Very informative podcast. Nice and easy to digest. Would benefit from having the subjects reveal any financial disclosures.
2678,UpToDate Talk,Wonderful,5,"Very appreciative pharmacist here, love how the host sets the stage with a brief review of the topic and goes on to delve into studies and details regarding treatments and practical implications."
2679,UpToDate Talk,"Right length, right content",5,"I'm a big fan of podcasts. This one is well-done, well-curated, and perfect for the busy practitioner (generalist, in my case)."
2680,UpToDate Talk,Great idea,5,Staying tuned
2681,UpToDate Talk,Looks really promising!,5,Obviously only one episode in but seams like a great way to keep up on changes while driving or walking the dog. I like how they break it up into miny segments so if I don't have time to listen to the whole thing I have a good stopping point.
2682,UpToDate Talk,Needs some work,4,"This is very exciting to the many of us who use UpToDate in our daily practice. The first episode was interesting and engaging. My only complaint is regarding the audio recording. It was harsh, screechy and difficult to listen to."
2683,UpToDate Talk,"Very promising, needs work",2,"This is a very promising podcast from an excellent organization, but I've been underwhelmed thus far. My biggest complaint is that while the ""interview"" format is a good idea, it's not taken far enough. Rather than a conversation between two doctors working together to understand and contextualize new developments in medicine, the podcast often devolves into a boring 15-minute monologue from some expert. To make this more listenable and engaging, there needs to be a lot more back-and-forth."
2684,UpToDate Talk,UTD for the win.,5,Love it!
2685,UpToDate Talk,Great Podcast!,5,This is a wonderful and engaging podcast. Its just the right amount of information for each segment. Please continue with it!
2686,UpToDate Talk,Thank you,5,"Please add more about overscreening, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment; please include the birads score that is resulting in false positives on mammography."
2687,UpToDate Talk,Great podcast!,5,I'm a resident and I listen on my way to work. Perfect for busy medicine people that want the latest from the experts!
2688,UpToDate Talk,"Helpful, however...",2,"I appreciate this podcast and the current, evidenced-based research. Thank you. However, in regards to the podcast about ""care transformation,"" I'm so disappointed that I did not hear any mention of the critical role of Nurses. ""Clinical decision support"" includes nurses. Until the healthcare hierarchy is extinguished, positive change will not occur...Do you agree?"
2689,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Interesting and so Helpful,5,I love this podcast!! The hosts do a great job of breaking down major issues in healthcare while considering both sides of the arguments. I will definitely keep listening :)
2690,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Quality pod with great voices.,5,"Short, sweet and scientifically based. Good stuff- thanks, 2 Docs!"
2691,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Enjoy the talk very much,5,"In health informatics major, like this talk so much, hope more are coming!"
2692,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Political attitudes,1,You lost me when every episode I listened to spoke about politics. I listen to a medical podcast to hear about medicine. So I‚Äôll find something else.
2693,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Love your style,5,Interesting and informative. I hope they‚Äôll continue.
2694,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Favorite educational podcast,5,"As an applicant to medical school and someone who is generally interested in the state of healthcare, this is my absolute favorite podcast. I‚Äôve binged it for the past few months and have been absolutely absorbed/my interviewers were quite impressed! You two have inspired me to apply for a joint MPH and I cannot thank you enough for introducing me to my newest passion."
2695,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,VERY INFORMATIVE,5,"I am a medical assistant and there are a lot of things small practices expect you to know , that we shouldn‚Äôt know but have too, things most providers know. This has helped me greatly in my career In the smaller doctors offices that rely more on their staff"
2696,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,One of my top 3 favorite podcasts!,5,"These 2 Docs are insightful, informative, and humorous. I've learned a lot about medical conditions and treatments, as well as the business and politics of medicine. I look forward to every new episode."
2697,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,GREAT INFO,5,"Informative, not too long, docs are enjoyable to listen to! Thanks for the scoop ladies."
2698,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Meh,3,I was excited about this podcast and to be able to understand medical advancements/problems better. However it was more like listening to them spout of facts they‚Äôve pulled from the internet üò™
2699,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Informative and well made,5,I am a medical student and I listen to this podcast when I exercise. Each episode gives a simple overview of current medical issues. The format of the show fits the podcast medium very well (especially compared to some of the other medical podcasts out there)
2700,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Doctor Recommended,4,"More docs should do this. However, I do believe they had a ""swing and a miss"" on the sub clinical thyroid discussion. Thyroid supplementation should be more prescribed. üôå"
2701,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Love listening to this on my way in to work!,5,Great podcast.
2702,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,love the show,5,looking forward to your discussion on Trumpcare.
2703,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,By Louise Veuve,5,"I just listened to the podcast on Parkinson Disease. My best friend is my age, 68, and had early onset PD and has had it over 15 years. Your report was fascinating. She just send me a link that says a new drug has been found that promises better results than the main drugs being used now. I'm sure you can look up the research.
I really enjoy listening to your podcast as it helps keep me informed about current issues."
2704,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,2 Docs Talk,2,They get into social issues where they don't k now all the facts. They should stick to medicine.
2705,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Informative and Entertaining,5,Amy and Kendall have great chemistry! I'm a med student and I love this podcast.
2706,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Oversimplified,1,"The PP issue is much more than you give credit to. Pro-lifers want to reduce unwanted pregnancies yes but the majority of PPs income comes from abortions. It's unfortunately a business and one of their main products is abortion. Many past PP employees have attested to this. I work in an ICU with dying patients everyday and I don't lack the empathy and respect that the PP worker has in the video you defend.
Also will you do an episode on the side effects of birth control ?"
2707,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Wonderful!,5,I enjoy this show so much! Wonderful discussion. I learn something too. Thank you!
2708,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Needs audio optimization,2,Good info on relevant medical topics and news. Odd echos sound like scary voices in horror movies. Needs a pop filter. Must talk into microphone.
2709,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Short and packed episodes.,5,"As a future physician, not only is it encouraging to have two female physicians host the show, but they are direct, funny, and talk about everything involved with their topic. It is a completely informational, non-partisan podcast, which I'm thankful for."
2710,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Great podcast!,5,"Great podcast. Short and to the point never loosing my interest in a discussed topic.
Just right speed. Very intelligent, professional and funny hosts.
Highly recommended.
Thanks."
2711,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Nice work ladies,4,Clearly there doctors care about our patients. Enjoy their light hearted approach ....easy listening.
2712,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Hello,3,"I not aware of your situation
But if can you please stop rebroadcasting I‚Äôll be very grateful. I listened to all the episodes and I really like what you are doing, short, informative and interesting
Thank you"
2713,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Witty and Informative,5,"These ladies are doing a great job on their podcast. They cover important, current health topics in a way that is entertaining yet still packed with information."
2714,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Please do more podcasts!!,5,"I just found your podcast & I *love* it! Currently have listened to flu, thyroid & hospice. My only disappointmet is that you don't have more recent podcasts. Your down to earth dicussion, coupled with GREAT explanations of disease, illness & issues is much needed in this space. Keep it up & thank you!"
2715,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Picks Up Where the Headlines End,4,"This is such a great little podcast - you have the benefit of 2 Docs digging into health news and summarizing the evidence while also pointing out gaps and inconsistencies. The podcasts aren‚Äôt too long and neatly summarize information for non medical professionals. I especially appreciated episode 116 on weight loss. Would love to hear you address high intensity interval training, because as you point out, an hour of exercise per day can be difficult."
2716,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Old Geezer,5,A great place to learn about evidence based medicine!
2717,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Perfect for the Pre-Med Student!,5,"I highly recommend this podcast to any pre-med student. It has a wide range of topics, and all subjects are explained in mostly layman's terms. Dr. Britt and Dr. Rogers sprinkle in enough medical terminology and enough humor to keep every episode fascinating. In fact, I would recommend this podcast to anyone thinking about a future as a healthcare provider, whether as a future CNP, PA-C, DO, or MD. Amy and Kendall - please keep continuing to record!"
2718,2 Docs Talk:  Medicine | Health | Healthcare Policy | Evidence Based Medicine,Sadly they have the same perspective as every single other close minded ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù doctor,1,I was hoping hear something alittle more thoughtful and open minded. I was also hoping to find doctors that didn‚Äôt ONLY repeat what government agencies told them and actually thought for themselves and looked at credible independent studies that weren‚Äôt only funded by a pharma company.
2719,Skeptics with a K,Great show,5,"Love the friendship and the banter, the science and the politics. Everyone listening: head to Patreon and throw some $ or ¬£ their way!"
2720,Skeptics with a K,Love this show,5,Very informative with a likeable group of hosts.
2721,Skeptics with a K,The best!,5,"This podcast is the cheese to my burrito, the ham to my eggs and the iiiiiii to my sush."
2722,Skeptics with a K,Rigorous and entertaining,5,"Mike, Marsh and Alice do a great job speaking about controversial topics in meaningful ways. It seems clear that each host puts in a good deal of work preparing their talking points for each episode. Besides rigorous dives into each topic, the show has many lighthearted and comedic moments too. Highly recommended if you like Inkredulous or Be Reasonable."
2723,Skeptics with a K,Amazing show for new skeptics,5,"These guys have done a better job than Skeptics Guide in explaining very basic concepts of critical thinking and skepticism. They explain the scientific method, they have done a couple debunking studies of their own, and they tell decent jokes. They taught me how to read scientific papers and how to verify sources to see if something is true or not. They aren't as in depth on scientific studies as the Skeptics Guide, but I do recommend them to people who generally love to learn about ""woo"" and why it's false."
2724,Skeptics with a K,Funny Skeptics from the UK,5,"This podcast is sort of like a British version of the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast. It has three hosts: Mike Hall, Michael ""Marsh"" Marshall, and Alice Howarth. Mike Hall is the main host of the podcast and is the most comedic of the group. Marsh is a professional skeptic (possibly the only one in the UK) heavily involved in skeptical activism. Alice is the scientist of the group and brings the perspective of a researcher to the discussion. The podcast is loosely structured. It typically begins with the hosts talking about what they have been doing lately (trips they have gone on, something funny that happened recently, etc.). Then there are a series of segments about skeptical topics. This can include things like an evaluation of a news story or recently published scientific paper, a change in government policy regarding things like homeopathy, or some research or investigation one of the hosts has recently done. Finally, upcoming events such as Skeptics in the Pub are announced and the podcast finishes. Serious subjects are discussed but the hosts are not afraid to go off on tangents and make jokes quite frequently. They come across as a group of friends having a good time. If this sounds like something you want to listen to, I recommend listening to the most recent episode to get a taste of the podcast. Be careful, you might find yourself laughing out loud and people looking at you strangely."
2725,Skeptics with a K,keep up the good work,5,A great podcast with intellegent people who automatically sound smarter due to their accents.
2726,Skeptics with a K,One of my favorite skeptical podcasts,5,"I always save this podcast for last when I'm listening to podcasts because it is the one that makes me laugh, makes me think and sometimes as an American makes me apologize to the rest of the world. These are the podcasters I'd most like to sit and have a beer with in spite of the fact Michael appears to be borderline agoraphobic. Cheers!"
2727,Skeptics with a K,Love the show,5,"I've been a listener for years, shame on me for waiting this long to review."
2728,Skeptics with a K,Extended banter has gotten too long,2,"I used enjoy getting these but eventually, it became tedious to listen to the overly long banter in the beginning. Perhaps if they put that part at the end, it might work better? They could just as easily warm up with about three minutes of ""what did you do over the weekend"" rather than what seems like 10 or 15."
2729,Skeptics with a K,Entertaining and informative,5,"Rich in useful information, but delivered in a fun, casual way. Very accessible without being insulting, well worth your time"
2730,Skeptics with a K,Best of the three,5,"There are three podcasts produced by the Merseyside Skeptics. This is the best of them. It is logical, erudite, valid (there is an actual scientist and judging from her voice maybe a beautiful one, so remember girls/women, you can have it all), funny, not afraid (as long as there are no physical threats, Marsh) to call a phony a phoney. And of course, listening to this Podcast allows me to watch Morse/Lewis, etc. without subtitles.
And, maybe best of all, it actually comes out with regularity."
2731,Skeptics with a K,Dyspeptik with a K,5,"Great show once I figured out that my IPOD wasn't playing at double speed, that's just the way Marsh speaks. I would play it at half speed but then Alice starts to sound like Tim Curry. I grew up with a similar book to the Giant Book Of Fantastic Facts, but it had the title Uncle John's Bathroom Readers. I still quote information from that book and I have no idea if it is true. I live in Columbus Ohio (the only state where voting matters) and used to work in a call center with a fellow from Manchester. I will never forget the day I heard him tell a customer over the phone that he ""is speaking English, indeed I am English, and you sir are speaking my language, poorly I might add."" Needless to say he did not last long there. I lead a Skeptics in the Pub in Columbus and would love to know some ideas on growing the group and what kind of things you do in your group besides drinking beer and laughing at Sarah Palin. Love the show, Jack Meyers"
2732,Skeptics with a K,Always a good conversation,5,"Mike, Alice, and Marsh have great chemistry and discuss interesting topics."
2733,Skeptics with a K,The best skeptical podcast,5,"It‚Äôs a great mix of analysis/discussion of contemporary balderdash (woo!) and wicked fast clever jokes and bad puns. The chemistry among the 3 hosts is perfect and there‚Äôs rarely a dull moment. They are not mean-spirited, but are fair and reasonable, with plenty of self-deprecation to make them the most lovable skeptics around. I‚Äôve listened to several other similar podcasts and this is by far the best mix of humor and content."
2734,Skeptics with a K,Outrageously funny and provocative,5,I wish I lived on the Merseyside so I could stop in and meet the crew at a skeptics in the pub and stare awkwardly at my feet. Perhaps I'll take a vacation someday to do just that.
2735,Skeptics with a K,The Best.,5,"I‚Äôve been listening to this show forever, and realized I don‚Äôt think I have left a review in ages, if ever. That is utterly unforgivable and needed fixed. This is the podcast that was instrumental in helping me move from being an atheist to a skeptic. Listening to Mike, Marsh, the much missed Collin, and now the great Alice provided a humorous look at the way skepticism can be applied to the everyday, lived life. While there are now quite a few skeptical podcasts, this is still my favorite because it‚Äôs nice to hear skepticism done with a group of people whom obviously are friends in real life, and see that skeptics don‚Äôt have to be dour, humorless individuals. Skeptics with a K also shows how street level skepticism is needed not only for the obvious, but for things like media (4th paragraph rule & Press Releases passing as stories) and claims made about technology (Battery rechargers/music file quality). If you haven‚Äôt listened yet, I cannot imagine what you are waiting for."
2736,Skeptics with a K,"Great podcast, but...",5,"You asked for reviews, so here you go: I love this podcast, but why does my other favorite Merseyside Skeptics' Society podcast only get released *maybe* once each year (near April 1st) if at all? Skeptics With a C needs to get back to work, because their podcast is the only one I love more than Skeptics with a K."
2737,Skeptics with a K,It's just science.,5,"Nice collection of reasonable people.

2738,Skeptics with a K,A cautionary tale,5,Skeptics with a K is the terrifying story of homeopathy's growing popularity and support by the NHS in the UK. At least if you listen in reverse order like I do.
2739,Skeptics with a K,One of my favorite podcasts,5,The content is always entertaining but still informative.
2740,Skeptics with a K,Hands down my favorite podcast.,5,"Highly informative, wonderfully entertaining, yet unclassifiable (hence the lack of awards ""and the award for the podcast about stuff and things and such..."".) Alice, Marsh, and that other guy ... oh yeah, Mike Hall (actually an unsung hero in the skeptic community) discuss topics on bad medicine, bad surveys, bad reporting, and practices that prey on the vulnerable and uninformed (which is all of us at one point or another).
Their compassion is evidenced by their genuine anger at those who willfully misrepresent bunk and by the causes the three and their parent org support.
But the most important part of the presentation remains the fun, humor, and conversational style. We all rooted for Alice as she joined the group just a year ago as a podcasting novice and has grown to become fully engaged in the incessant side-bars that are the core of the entertainment value.
To really discover what this podcast is all about I usually point people to episode 100, which gives wonderful examples of the story styles covered. But the quality of recent episodes all demonstrate the entertainingly informative skeptical dissection of recent reporting and events. Congratulations to Alice and those two guys.
Since this is an iTunes review rather than a blog, I've horribly abbreviated what should be a more fully reasoned explanation of why this could become your favorite podcast. I'm sorry about that (or I could say ""your welcome"", depending on what you're looking for.)
Random highlights: incessant bad puns, humor that is thankfully not so ""British"", QED, Alice explaining the biology part of quackery, Mike's universe of music and attire, Marsh being ... well ... Marsh.
Btw, I have a thing about parenthetical phrases. I'm seeking help."
2741,Skeptics with a K,Fun and interesting,5,"I enjoy listening to these guys and gal banter back and forth. I like when they take an insane product or paper and break it down skeptically. The only thing I don't like is when they criticize us Americans, as if they don't realize they have an American audience ;) or am I the only one?"
2742,Skeptics with a K,My new skeptical pod!,5,"I've been without a skepticism podcast for several years, after the shouted quotes and skeptical community politics of a certain other pod turned me off. This pod fills that gap perfectly--it's all of the bants, debunking, and critical thought with none of the shouty bits or infighting. Plus, extra funny and accents!"
2743,Skeptics with a K,I like you guys,5,You make me feel smart.
2744,Skeptics with a K,My favorite podcast,5,"Skeptics with a K is my favorite podcast (and I listen to quite a few)
Mike, Marsh & Alice are funny and informative. I always laugh, (which can be slightly embarrassing on the bus) I always learn something , and I really appreciate their well-reasoned and insightful opinions. I have listened to every single episode (some multiple times) and they just keep getting better and better!
Keep up the good work boys!!
Thanks!"
2745,Skeptics with a K,Love it,5,You guys make me laugh!
2746,Skeptics with a K,"These guys are really, very fun to listen to",5,"Love, love, love these guys and their skeptical conversations INCLUDING the inane chatter about Doctor Who, laser tag, liquid dinners in a can, t-shirt suits and Warren."
2747,Skeptics with a K,Great Skeptical podcast,5,"I love listening to this show whenever they decide to put one out. I really don't mind it when they talk about their lunch or whatever a ""bell end"" is-- it's worth it for the long diatribes on the placebo effect. If you're not subscribed already, subscribe NOW!"
2748,Skeptics with a K,Greetings from Upstate NY!,5,"I want to start my review by apologizing for that whole President Trump thing. You guys did Brexit, and you know us Americans...We always have to out-do everyone else, even if it's making disastrous political decisions.
Anyhow, This is the best skeptical podcast out there! Your level of banter is second to none, as are your obscure references. I don't know what a Caramac is, but I did learn from you folks that it's a good unit of measure over there. I'm rambling now, so yeah..."
2749,iCritical Care: All Audio,Please make an effort,2,"To do at least a tiny amount of post processing. I‚Äôm often a fan of this podcast but your postproduction is so bad that I can‚Äôt listen anymore. In the most recent episode, your guest audio had so many large bass spikes that it blew out one of my speakers. I frequently have to turn the volume down so much in my headphones that the show is almost inaudible. Please just add some gating. Pay someone the $50 per episode or learn it yourself or you‚Äôre going to lose listeners"
2750,iCritical Care: All Audio,Great talks on important topics,5,These are fabulous talks for the critical care professional or serious student.
2751,iCritical Care: All Audio,Iffy,3,Nice content. Audio quality is marginal at best on the other hand. This is especially problematic when a guest has a thick accent.
2752,iCritical Care: All Audio,Poor quality audio high quality content,4,Poor audio quality mars experience w high quality content of episode of pathophysiology of AKI. Pls pay attention to this. Thanks
2753,iCritical Care: All Audio,Audio!!!,3,Sounds extremely useful but the audio is horrible. As the experts go to mention a key fact the audio picks up random noises or static that drowns out the information. Need better professional audio.
2754,iCritical Care: All Audio,Pulmonary MD,2,These topics seem mostly political and not very useful in daily management of critical care patients.. I recommend opening a Critical Care text and basing your podcasts on those topics.. Would be nice to have management pearls and discussions by people who actually manage patients instead of lecturing about it.. It is easy to tell the difference. Sorry not to echo all the praises being tossed out here but I don't agree with them .
2755,iCritical Care: All Audio,Ew! U can hear the saliva!,1,Please let the host know that it is gross to hear the saliva in her mouth! perhaps a filter on her mic could eliminate this. I can't even listen to this podcast JUST because of the saliva sounds!!!
2756,iCritical Care: All Audio,Pulmonary artery catheter,2,Discussion subjective especially for one with such limited experience
2757,iCritical Care: All Audio,Sedation and Delerium,5,"Just finished listening to pod cast on 2013 Pain, Agitation and Delerium guidelines. GREAT talk, a must listen."
2758,iCritical Care: All Audio,A must for all who interface with the icu!,5,Extremely informative! Love the new hosts!
2759,iCritical Care: All Audio,Expert in Critical Care Medicine,5,Dr. Savel is clearly an expert in critical care medicine. I am sure this podcast would be very helpful to anyone in the field.
2760,iCritical Care: All Audio,SCCM iCritical Care,5,I have been listening to the SCCM podcasts for over 2 yrs. I especially enjoy listening to R. Savel. He is cutting edge critical care. It is nice to be able to listen to the leaders in the field talking about important clinical issues and management. It helps me to stay current. Keep them coming!
2761,iCritical Care: All Audio,iCritical Care - MANDATORY for all !!!,5,"As a resident, Dr. Savel's podcasts have been a godsend for me. ¬†It helped me so much during my ICU rotations. ¬†I was on top of all the most important CC issues and practice guidelines ( I'm still subscribed !!). ¬†The people he has on are the ""who's who"" in CC. ¬†Should be¬†mandatory¬†for all those that want to know and practice CC. ¬†"
2762,iCritical Care: All Audio,MD,5,"Wether listening on a train, bus, or sitting in a traffic jam - why waste time, when you can be listening to a critical care maverick interviewing other gurus in the field and sharpen your critical care thinking and practice. Dr Richard Savel does not disappoint - NY rush hour bring it on !!!"
2763,iCritical Care: All Audio,Great SCCM Podcast,5,"This is one of the best CCM resources available today. The format allows listeners to get a first hand take on cutting edge CCM research through conversations with leading authors.
Listening to these podcasts is valuable to anyone caring for critically ill patients. By listening to these interviews, one can gain an excellent understanding of the issues surrounding the delivery of CCM, and the challenges facing physicians and their patients in intensive care units."
2764,iCritical Care: All Audio,Highest Possible Rating.,5,"This is the best medical podcast for clinicians in iTunes...bar none. It is also an amazing reference for the latest articles and controversies in ICU medicine.
This stuff is fascinating if you are clinician, it does not have sound effects or explosions...The interviews are with top notch people, the material flows and is quite compelling.
I would have given it six stars...but like I said, there were no explosions.
Thank-you Dr. Savel."
2765,iCritical Care: All Audio,Review,5,Dr.Savel has done a fantastic job with these pod casts. I tell all of my students and resident about them. Congratulations and keep up the great work.
2766,iCritical Care: All Audio,Informative and in depth,5,Great interviews with leaders in our field. Cutting edge discussions.
2767,Louisville Lectures Internal Medicine Lecture Series Podcast,Ultimate resource,5,"If you wana rock a topic, listen to these heroes of medicine. I am very grateful of them..."
2768,Louisville Lectures Internal Medicine Lecture Series Podcast,Excellent up to date knowledge,5,Thanks so much for making these available! As an ms3 these lectures have taught me many new things!!!!
2769,Louisville Lectures Internal Medicine Lecture Series Podcast,Great review,5,Great review series to listen to while I bike to work. Keep them coming and thanks so much.
2770,Louisville Lectures Internal Medicine Lecture Series Podcast,Lorrel Brown MD,5,"I never review anything online‚Ä¶.
However, as a Critical Care Cardiology/Cardiac Surgery Physician Assistant, I thoroughly enjoy the lectures presented by Dr. Lorrel Brown. They are phenomenal! The delivery is so engaging that I tend to lose track of time while listening. Every topic she presents is relevant to my daily practice. I found her lectures regarding Arrhythmias and Aortic Stenosis particularly on point. We have a huge Cardiology/CVICU mid-level team and I will certainly recommend that they watch her videos/Podcasts. On a larger scale, the Louisville Lecture Series is fantastic."
2771,Louisville Lectures Internal Medicine Lecture Series Podcast,Awesome,5,This is great
2772,KQED Science News,It's Great!,5,Thank-you so much!
2773,Orbital Path,Black holesüï≥,4,We need more space vacuums. #blackholes2020üï≥
2774,Orbital Path,Black Holes from the Dawn of Light,5,What a fantastic episode! I wish she would restart this podcast!!!
2775,Orbital Path,Lost in the cosmos,5,I am lost without this podcast and the soothing voice of Michelle. I now know the emptiness of space and the void between galaxies.
2776,Orbital Path,More,4,What a great podcast. Always was interesting to hear and it was always informative. I enjoyed listening and felt I learned something from it. I am just sad that the ride is over. Where do we write to keep this ride going?
2777,Orbital Path,So sad Orbital Path has ended.,5,"We, humans from planet Earth need a podcast like this one. Please consider coming back! Thank you."
2778,Orbital Path,More?,4,Any chance you could do more than just one every 6 years?
2779,Orbital Path,love this!!!,5,thanks for bring these awesome astronomy and cosmology stories to the people!!!
2780,Orbital Path,Outstanding!,5,"Michelle, thank you for creating this podcast. You ask terrific questions, host smart and inspiring guests and always manage to expand how I see the world. I'm thrilled to have found this podcast. Keep up the great work!"
2781,Orbital Path,Orbital Path is very intellectually entertaining.,5,I‚Äôve been listening to Orbital Path for a few years now. Each new installment has interesting scientific observations and is presented in an intellectually stimulating manner. Good stuff!
2782,Orbital Path,This podcast gets five stars from me!,5,"I‚Äôve listened to some episodes of Orbital Path more than once. They are informative, engaging, and well edited. Anyone with an interest in physics, astronomy, space, or science in general will enjoy this series."
2783,Orbital Path,Yayyy!,4,So happy I just love this pod! All science and nature bluffs like me please watch this!
2784,Orbital Path,Wonderful,5,This is a great podcast! It's short and sweet and intellectual and engages you in the curiosity the podcaster obviously has.
2785,Orbital Path,Awesome space podcast,5,No background in astronomy needed for this wonderful podcast. Interesting and thought-provoking without being too technical. I just wish they came out more frequently!
2786,Orbital Path,Excellent,5,"Love it! Accessible, eloquent and fun without getting hokey. I was never fond of science when I was in school, unfortunately, and now that I‚Äôm older and am trying to get into it I find it really helpful to listen to podcasts like this that introduce complex things in a way that a layman like me can understand. Subscribed."
2787,Orbital Path,My new favorite podcast!,5,"I‚Äôm a space-nut, and this podcast is like astro-crack for the ears! It is so well produced with interesting topics and enthusiastic guests who have a passion for their work. I have been waiting w/ baited breath for each new episode and gobble it up with zeal. You can tell that Michelle Thraller‚Äôs guests are experts in their respective fields, and her commentary at the end does a great job in wrapping it all up. Whether an expert stargazer, or middle-school kid working on their science fair project anyone and everyone will find this podcast intriguing and engaging."
2788,Orbital Path,"Love the podcast, wish it was longer",5,"I absolutely love this podcast, I constantly find myself wishing it was longer though. Please consider longer form episodes either with multiple guests or even more in depth content! Keep up the awesome work!"
2789,Orbital Path,Love it,5,Great podcast. Can't wait for more episodes
2790,Orbital Path,"Fantastic host, great subject matter",5,"This is really a must-listen if you're into this type of science at all. The host is fantastic, so enthusiastic and energetic. The information is solid and interesting. My only wish is that each episode were longer!"
2791,Orbital Path,Amazing,5,Great
2792,Orbital Path,Look forward to every episode,5,Episodes have been scarse lately but I thoroughly enjoy them!
2793,Orbital Path,The planets have aligned!,5,A podcast about the universe around us that isn't over your head. Very informative and makes me think about the world-and space around me. Keep em coming!
2794,Orbital Path,Always fascinating,5,"I love these short, informative and entertaining podcasts! Actually, sometimes I don't want the episode to be over! I also get excited to see a new episode in my feed."
2795,Orbital Path,Good show but smacking lips,3,This is just a personal pet peeve but I cannot stand to hear the smacking of saliva when someone talks. It ruins my whole experience.
2796,Orbital Path,Awesome podcast about space science,5,"This is the third great podcast I discovered after TWIS and StarTalk. Highly recommended to folks who love to follow Hubble, JWST news, read stories about our solar system exploration and so on."
2797,Orbital Path,thanks,5,for the show
2798,Orbital Path,My Favorite Astronomy Podcast,5,"Of 50+ audio podcast subscriptionson on a variety of topics, Orbital Path is the one I look forward to the most and immediately listen to each episode on release. Michelle Thaller reawakens the listeners natural curiosity of the universe in which we all live."
2799,Orbital Path,Contagious enthusiasm!,5,Not an expert in anything space or math but these concise explorations are fun and always put topics in context. Very charmed by the host's endless enthusiasm üíö
2800,Orbital Path,Listen immediately!,5,"I download this podcast pretty much as soon as it comes out. I dive a truck for a living and sometimes don‚Äôt have access to streaming. Being a backyard astronomer when I am home with my 10inch DOB, I have always loved science and space in particular and was thrilled to hear the 1st episode about the possibility of a giant ‚Äúalien‚Äù structure being built around a distant starüëΩ. What better way to pass the miles besides pondering the possibility that every moment you experience exists forever. Try this podcast, while much of the science is over my head the presentation is great and fun to listen to.
Chris Handley"
2801,Orbital Path,Michelle is awesome,5,I had the pleasure of meeting Michelle. What an awesome experience and I love this podcast.
2802,Orbital Path,So well-produced,5,Love it...from a fellow astrophysicist ‚ú®üåô
2803,Ask an Astronomer,"DON""T GET IT!!!",1,"Should iget this podcast, i mean i kniw its free and all but is it reallly worth it??"
2804,Ask an Astronomer,"Wonderful, informative, but music is irritating!",3,"This would rate 5 stars. Brief interviews and overviews, with good animations of basic astronomical information and processes. The problem? There are constant jingles, irritating little repetitive snippets of artificial music that keep going on, even when the scientists are being interviewed or the narrator is explaining an animation. It gets in the way of the learning, the enchantment, both literally and figuratively! Lose the background muzak and you'd have a 5 star podcast on your hands!"
2805,Ask an Astronomer,Amusing and smart!,5,"Love the astronomers, the subjects, the explanations, the videos and animations and the music."
2806,Ask an Astronomer,the best podcast!,5,This is the greatest podcast. Thank you very much for taking the time and creating such amazing videos that are easy to understand and are very educational. Great job!!
2807,Ask an Astronomer,Great for all ages,4,"My 5 year old loves space and will watch these over and over. While he does not understand everything, it provides information to him and me making him even more curious. more please..."
2808,Ask an Astronomer,"Good for a quick burst - look elsewhere for longer, richer programming.",3,"This video podcast is great in a pinch - succint answers by real scientists and explanations that hit the spot. If you're looking for more in-depth content, like longer stories, and full TV episodes I recommend the Terra video podcast (see 'The Search for Life on Mars')."
2809,Ask an Astronomer,Excellent work!,4,"Great educational videos! I am an Assistant English Teacher in a small town in Japan. I am constantly looking for simple podcasts to show to my students. Although the English in these videos is too difficult for junior high students I may still show a few. The videos are fun and easy to understand. They are also a good review of my physics class from college :)
Good work NASA!"
2810,Ask an Astronomer,Informative,3,"This is a pretty good podcast, but I constantly have to ask myself whether or not I am going to unsubscribe and delete them all because of the horrible noise in the beginning. The graphics are needlessly childlike, and I would doubt that many kids watch podcasts, but even if they did it is clearly not necessary. It does however really detract from the ability to watch this. I would gladly continue to subscribe if you created a more mature (and much less aurally annoying) introduction, please!!"
2811,Ask an Astronomer,tutucutie,5,This is an awesome podcast! It gives so much info in less than 3 minuts. Also it is a video so it is fun to whatch. I would recomend this to anyone who wonders about space.
2812,Ask an Astronomer,Good on all levels,5,"This video podcast series is great! First it has content that is informative. I like learning. Secondly, I like them because they demonstrate appropriate technology and budgeting. They spent their time on graphics that were really great and kept the scientist portion low budget because they just needed to tell the story. Better than trying to make a NASA scientist look something other than what they are. This shows the real life nature of being a scientist. Also I like the video podcasts because they demonstrate that many could make video podcasts, and NOT have to jazz them up! Good job NASA! MacFriendly"
2813,Ask an Astronomer,good to know,3,"i liked this podcast because it explains intriguing concepts that i didn't understand beforehand. it seems geared towards junior high school students...but i like it anyway. nice pix of copernicus! please keep it running! i want to learn more.
ps. in response to labelle: not all podcasts suck. try rocketboom and lonely planet's podcasts. you don't have to learn on those."
2814,Ask an Astronomer,Excellent!!,5,"I have children who are constantly wanting to use my Ipod when we are out. I appreciate the alternative! Thank you for giving us the option to view podcasts that are not only interesting, but also educational -for all ages! If anyone has any interest at all in the world/universe in which we live, these podcasts are an excellent choice!"
2815,Hubblecast SD,HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEE,5,I like Hubble
2816,Hubblecast SD,Excellent astronomy podcast,5,The images in the HD version of this podcast are incredible; Dr. J is an excellent presenter.
2817,Hubblecast SD,Beautiful!,5,I love this podcast. So much information in such a short section of time. Yet it is done in the most simplified matter that anyone watching will believe that being an astronomer is easy! I would definitely recommend that schools play this in any of their age level classes because that is how informative it is.
2818,Hubblecast SD,"Thank You, Thank You, Thank You",5,Thank you for putting the early ones back on here!
2819,Hubblecast SD,So Cool,5,Keep it up. I love this stuff!
2820,Hubblecast SD,Finally!!,5,"At last the first 6 podcasts are out! By the way, this is a great video with amazing visuals."
2821,Hubblecast SD,Incredible Production!,5,"Great program, with a high production value, great comentary highly informative, need I say more?"
2822,Hubblecast SD,AWESOME,5,"Wonderful pictures, great information and commentary (& I really love the accent ;) but maybe that's just me)
All in all, it's just freakin' awesome"
2823,Hubblecast SD,Words can't describe it!,5,"Absoulutly astonishing! Great graphics and information. Not too overdone, but just right."
2824,Hubblecast SD,Mind Boggling,5,Top notch commentary and graphics are out of this world. Simply Excellent!
2825,Hubblecast SD,Incredible!,5,"This podcast is simply amazing. The visuals, the commentary...everything combines to make this podcast like no other. Simply awesome."
2826,Hubblecast SD,Tremendous!,5,"This is a fantastic podcast! I eagerly await each episode, and love all the new visuals and pictures! Wish there were more like this one..."
2827,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,All-around great podcast. Perfect for med students!,5,"I started to listen to this podcast in the first week of my M1 year. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I was listening to every episode regardless of the speciality. Now, more than half way through my M2 year, I try to listening to anything pertaining to anesthesia(my primary interest). I‚Äôm amazed how a busy med student is able to run such a well structured podcast, find doctors to interview, etc. I listen while doing my Anki reviews LOL. I‚Äôm hoping for a pain management anesthesia episode!!"
2828,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Very informative podcast,5,"As someone who will be attending medical school next fall, this podcast provides a very in-depth view of all aspects of various medical specialties. I would recommend this to any medical student or pre-med as a useful resource for learning more about different specialties and the medical field in general."
2829,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Great first stop to start thinking about potential specialties,5,"As a non-traditional M1 coming from a business background, medical school has been a pretty overwhelming change and leaves not a lot of time for shadowing and career exploration. I really appreciate this podcast for the insights into day-to-day life of physicians in multiple specialties. Thank you, Ian and guests, for dedicating your time to this and for sharing with the rest of us!"
2830,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Awesome podcast,5,This podcast is super well done and very informative!
2831,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Great show,5,Really miss this one
2832,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,No pathologists or forensic doctors?,5,Pathology is a specialty that gets shunned and many students don‚Äôt really know about it. It is worth giving perspective. Same goes for forensic medicine.
2833,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Awesome!,5,This is a great resource! Love the show
2834,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Amazing podcast!,5,A truly impressive bank of very detailed deep dives into individual physicians lives and careers. This really helps a medical student like myself understand what it would be like to be one of these doctors.
2835,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Good for 1st and 2nd years,4,"This is great for those who have no idea what they want to do. For others who know, the 4th year episodes were helpful guidance, though I had heard much of it before. His interview style has improved, though sometimes it can be awkward or cut people off. In the future, could explore applicants in certain specialties like the 4th year episodes in a condensed format for the tips and tricks of applying in certain specialties that require specific things."
2836,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Great Podcast,5,Started this podcast on the Med school interview trail and have never looked back. Also If anyone is curious Ian is just as eloquent and friendly in person. Thankful for the great work.
2837,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Very interesting even if you aren't a Medical Student yet,5,"Most interesting show even if you aren't a Medical Student yet. In a way it's abit like watching Grey's Anatomy... but more than that, the interviews raises questions each of us ask himself to make a career decisions."
2838,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,very Professional,5,"I recommended, this is a super idea Podcast, Great content"
2839,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,I'm Encouraged,5,"This podcast is the right idea and desperately needed now more than ever. As an ADHD Coach, I can attest to our growing culture of specialty being sorely ill-informed. This is a step to rectify that problem that I'm happy to support!"
2840,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Fantastic for pre meds too,5,Listen to this now
2841,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,A hit for even a non-medical professional!,5,"I love what you are doing with this podcast. I started listening with my boyfriend, who is entering his third year in medical school at Michigan State University. He has had some struggles in nailing down what it is he wants to do as well, and this podcast has provided insight not found in other forums and resources. As a consequence, I've become hooked. I continue to listen and learn just how specialized medicine can be, and it's incredibly rewarding to learn new things about a field that can be so mysterious to a non-medical professional. I can't wait to listen even more, and wish you the best of luck in your future in medicine!"
2842,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Incredible Podcast!,5,"I am in love with this podcast. If you are looking for deep, thorough, funny, interesting, and honest information about medical specialties...look no further. The way he sticks to the format for each epidsode really helps to be able to compare and contrast the specialties and the long length allows the converstation to get really in depth and answer all the questions you have as a listener. I can't get enough and I've been flying through episdoes. I've learned a lot about some of the lesser known specialties and I think this will be a huge asset for me when I eventually start medical school. Thanks for making this podcast, Ian."
2843,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Such an amazing source!,5,"Thank you very much! Doing it while you are in medical school too, kudos for you!"
2844,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Very helpful for medical students,5,This is a great idea and really helped me get a better sense of my options. It was great to hear from many different physicians and get insight into different fields and specific advice they have to offer. Thanks so much!
2845,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Basically a series of orthopedic interviews,1,"Listen to speciality stories instead. This is basically Ian recording personal interviews for the specialty he cares about (ortho) he doesn't interview much else fairly and is clearly biased in his interview selections. Not very helpful. Listen to specialty stories instead, it's less biased and more professional."
2846,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,"Enjoyable, enlightening. Signed, a layperson.",5,"I'm not even a medical student (or pre-med, though I do work with medical students), and I still turn to TUMS for my podcast-listening pleasure. Interviews are well-guided and dynamic even though the episodes follow the same format each time. Plastic Surgery and Geriatric med are especially must-listens."
2847,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,so heplful,5,"You will hear doctors, residents, fellows talk about their field, their day to day work, etc... It has been helpful for me, thanks Ian."
2848,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,M1 listener,5,This so far has been a great podcasts for me to develop a working knowledge of field types and particular areas I might be interested in! I love listening will I‚Äôm at the gym
2849,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Noteworthy,5,"Ian,
Thank you for crushing it in these interviews. You ask thoughtful questions and are confident enough to push attendings when they don‚Äôt fully answer your questions. It is oddly inspirational.
A wonderful podcast for anyone looking to learn more about a specialty whether you‚Äôre a medical student or not.
Keep it up."
2850,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Amazing Resource for Premeds and Beyond,5,This is such an excellent podcast. Ian does a great job with interviewing each physician and getting into the nitty-gritty of each specialty. It is very helpful to hear what these interviews and I love listening to these especially on long drives!
2851,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Please be polite!!!!,1,"I so want to like this podcast because the information is great, but Ian drives me crazy trying to control the conversation so heavily. If you want to bring experts onto your show, then let them talk! He disrespectfully interrupts them over and over again and leaves me cringing for the professionals who know WAY more than him and are being talked over. Please just let the conversation flow and actually listen to the people you‚Äôre interviewing instead of worrying about your next question!"
2852,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Excellent resource,5,This is an excellent resource for medical students trying to decide what field might be right for them. As a current medical resident this is something I wish I would have known about early in medical school as I looked for more resources about what the many fields in medicine entailed. Excellent job !
2853,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Great Podcast,5,Ian does a great job of exploring as many aspects of a field as he can. Really helpful.
2854,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,This podcast is dope AF,5,"I‚Äôve been a fan for over a year and have probably heard every episode. Such a simple concept but the execution is flawless! Ian (the host) is a great interviewer/conversationalist and elicits useful, interesting answers from his guests.
Definitely very helpful for anyone wanting to learn about medicine or what field to choose, but the discussions about career planning/development and life satisfaction are pertinent to all. I‚Äôve also gotten a lot of great reading recommendations from crazy important doctors, cool!
Again, this podcast is dope - what a great idea/mission, and it is really just so well done."
2855,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,Helping me think early,5,"Thanks for this podcast. I am an M1, and this podcast has helped me think a lot about specialties early. So, thank you!"
2856,The Undifferentiated Medical Student,THIS. PODCAST. ROCKS.,5,"I absolutely LOVE this podcast. I'm currently studying for the STEP1 exam and I listen to this on my runs. It opened my eyes even more to the incredibly diverse field of medicine and gave me a framework of how to proceed as I start my clinical years. Ian asks really thorough and thoughtful questions and the guests on the show are very insightful and for the most part remind me why I'm still studying for this stupid exam.
Anyway, thanks again and we can't wait to hear what you choose!!!"
2857,Lost Origins,Invokes questions and deep thought,5,"I've been listening for a few months now, and have ingested about 1-1/2 years worth of Andrew and CK's podcast. I love the ""question everything"" mindset... there is so much that we either don't know or *think* we know that is probably wrong about the history of the human race and other things. For those who want to put their head in the sand, that's fine. Some of us are more interested in what the truth really is. And the segments with Eden are awesome - it makes me smile to think of her trying to get her mind around some of these ideas. Anyway, I often find myself looking at my phone to see if there are any new podcast episodes, because of you and several other truth seekers. Keep up the good work!"
2858,Lost Origins,Dope Podcast,5,"You guys have a dope podcast, good topics, thought provoking, and good points of view; I just wish they were a little longer lol"
2859,Lost Origins,Old Earth,1,Not informative. Mostly opinionated with the illusion of authority.
2860,Lost Origins,Love the topics but...,3,Overall decent show but hosts should speak less.
2861,Lost Origins,Hanging w your smart/fun friends.,5,"Always a good time having your eyes opened and mind flexed with these 2 intelligent dudes.
This duo is full of personality and playfulness while maintaining high thought content while keeping up with amazing guests.
Articulate, inquisitive and educational, balanced with rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll sprinkles,
it‚Äôs always like a satisfying hang with your cool, nerdy friends.
Warning: highly addictive.
Yes, please and thank you."
2862,Lost Origins,Well Educated Show,5,"This show is the perfect combination of light hearted attitude and well educated hosts. These hosts don't just ask questions, they know the topics well. But it‚Äôs also light hearted and not too serious."
2863,Lost Origins,David Miano,1,"This guy had no good arguments at all , everything he said was just main stream trash that they are brainwashed into thinking. Everything to him was ancient people only told story‚Äôs no truth at all."
2864,Lost Origins,New favorite podcast!,5,"Discovered this podcast in September. Blew through first two seasons in no time, now I wait every week for a new ep to drop. Can‚Äôt get enough. üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº"
2865,Lost Origins,Cartoon,2,"Anyone else think these two sound like Beavus and Butt-head? Beavus and Butt- head ride again. I listened again, grow up gentlemen. My 17 year old daughter thinks you sound like Valley Girls 80s. Be mature adults, your not the younger generation, you are dad bods. üëç"
2866,Lost Origins,Good work!,5,"I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt find this podcast sooner. After going through quite a bit of similarly themed shows, I give the prize to Lost Origins for being professional, intelligent, and funny all at the same time. The audio is of high quality and guest interviews are very diverse. Keep up the great work!"
2867,Lost Origins,Awesome,5,Love listening to the show. It opens your mind constantly!!
2868,Lost Origins,Keeping an Open Mind,5,Love listening to fill the void of ‚Äúhmmm what if‚Äù. Will continue üôèüèª
2869,Lost Origins,Hosts are annoying,3,They have good guest only to talk over them in an absurd redundant interludes that ruin the information
2870,Lost Origins,Great show,5,Interesting guests.
2871,Lost Origins,I‚Äôm on my dads ipad xD,5,Hey guys it‚Äôs mah Eden on the ask a sixth grader.
2872,Lost Origins,Omg the audio is killing me!!,5,I love the show but come on man the audio is Terrible!! Please fix . I am a fan. I would like to continue to be but I might murder my phone in a minute.
2873,Lost Origins,Phantastic Philosophical Phun!,5,"What an amazing blend of the mysterious and serious! An unmatched alloy of mind bending speculation and hard evidence based exploration. Look forward to many more seasons of this unique, entertaining, and educational show!"
2874,Lost Origins,"Great, but",5,Please don‚Äôt continue with the Big Bang Theory questions. Please.
2875,Lost Origins,Major Spoilers! These hosts know things!!!,5,"Season 1 was great with the monoliths and super knowledgeable guests. Season 2 was even better with CK adding his k-nowledge, ham horn and intelligent banter to the mix. Plus ‚Äúask a 6th grader‚Äù who I'm pretty sure moved on to the 7th grade mid-season. Cant wait for season 3!! You guys cover all the topics I‚Äôve been fascinated by for decades. Thank you so much for diving in head first to alternative history and bringing it to the masses!!! Keep it going and add even more Sonja Grace-type guests who not only broaden history but our minds and help fill in gaps that stones and stars fail to do on their own."
2876,Lost Origins,Interesting episodes,5,These guys have great interviews with authors of books you never knew you wanted to hear about. Always interesting and they draw you in with their conversations. Give them a try !!
2877,Lost Origins,Great interviews!!,5,Some podcasts can be stilted and listeners feel a gap between the interviewer and guests...LOST ORIGINS is seamless! It is such a wonderful conversation to participate in as a listener and their subject matter is ALWAYS fascinating!!
2878,Lost Origins,The trip you‚Äôve been searching for.,5,"Lost Origins will take you on the trip your brain keeps begging you to take. Andrew and CK are the perfect guides. Love the interviews, insights and just hearing these guys converse."
2879,Lost Origins,Fantastic to see you back and it‚Äôs even better!,5,I thoroughly enjoyed your podcast when you initially launched it a few years ago and finding out a third season was coming got me excited to say the least. The new dynamic with a co-host (KC) works extremely well and adds even more to a great podcast. The third season has been fantastic and I look forward to each episode.
2880,Lost Origins,Fantastic conversations!,5,"Absolutely loving this show! I was very sad when I found this channel and realized season one ended in 2016. However, after some time of not listening and coming back to realize a new season is out I am exceptionally excited! Great show guys and keep up the excellence!"
2881,Lost Origins,"Love the content, guests and good interview skills!",5,The content is awesome and I really appreciate how professional the interviewers are. Its refreshing to hear! I also am enjoying the ‚Äúfun‚Äù parts they‚Äôve added to break up the deep info. Keep it up!!
2882,Lost Origins,A Fantastic Platform For Discussing Topics That Question Our Origins As A Species,5,"The world is mysterious! This show will discuss many topics regarding our age old questions of who and why and what we are in relation to our past. Plus, this show will explore several theories that challenge us to think...really think. Dig in if you are curious...there is a reason why you are here."
2883,Lost Origins,LO,5,"Throughout my life, I‚Äôve always felt like I was on a journey to find something. Whether it be truth, answers or something else entirely...I‚Äôve always looked to books, films, videos or podcasts to find ideas or theories that get the gears of my brain turning. Lost Origins has been a sanctuary that I escape to from the mundane patches of everyday life. You guys have an amazing chemistry with each other, and I have yet to listen to an episode that hasn‚Äôt challenged or built up some of the beliefs I already have about the world around us. Lost Origins has also inspired me to start my own conversations with people in my life, to poke the bear of mindsets around me. Please don‚Äôt ever stop doing this. You guys have cannonballed into the pool of humanities collective consciousness, and I assure you...waves are being felt everywhere. Here‚Äôs to hoping we get everyone to jump in, the water‚Äôs fine!
Cheers, guys!

2884,Lost Origins,Interesting alternative questions,5,"This is a fun little show that dives into a bunch of alternative history theories. Some episodes are a little farther out than others, but overall it‚Äôs good entertainment, and makes you question some common historical beliefs that don‚Äôt necessarily add up."
2885,Lost Origins,Worth a listen!,4,"Good show, great guests. Definitely worth a listen for unique topics. I could do without the romper room interviews, but happy they moved that part to the end of the show"
2886,Lost Origins,Must Listen!,5,"I am so glad I found the Lost Origins podcast Andrew and CK are knowledgeable and personable hosts to a guest list is the all-stars of the esoteric. They ask the right questions and allow their guests to ‚Äúunpack‚Äù their research and provide their deep insights. If you question the history you learned in school, and you know there are ancient mysteries and lost civilizations waiting to be found..this is the team you want to join!
Conversations with Eden adds additional answers you will find no where else. I absolutely agree with her belief that many of our lost secrets may be lost under the oceans and at the bottom of the Mariana Trench!"
2887,Moonwalk,So good,4,"6 episodes in and I‚Äôm crushing on Mohnish pretty hard. Witty, intelligent and funny."
2888,Moonwalk,LOVE this podcast!,5,"Moonwalk reminds me a lot of Radiolab in how it finds the most interesting subjects to explore and discuss and generally blow your mind. And they're pretty short, too. Leaves you wanting more. Great job!"
2889,Moonwalk,Dude bros who laugh at dead dogs.,1,After listening to one episode I was blown away by the agressive humor around dogs dieing in one of there episodes. Did not find the relation to dogs dieing on the floor to first impressions. The show is outrageously stupid frat guys talking about ‚Äústupid homelessness‚Äù and ‚Äúdead dogs‚Äù who think they are intelligent and just make fun of others.
2890,Moonwalk,Dude Bros without a cause,1,"This podcast is a superficial take on topics I care about. It‚Äôs dudes talking from their limited experiences, not even supported by data, or facts, or applicable advice.
Don‚Äôt waste your time."
2891,Moonwalk,Insightful,5,Awesome show.. I'm a cook and sub teacher who listens to podcasts because they make me laugh and think creatively while working. You guys really inspire me to create my own podcast on everyday things in life. Thanks.
2892,Moonwalk,FANTASTIC info!!!!,5,"I've been able to glean a lot of great info from this podcast. I'm a lawyer and I teach people how to negotiate on my podcast and I come here for tips. Keep up the great work! I'm loving the info.
Kwame Christian"
2893,Moonwalk,Finally! People are talking,5,"It's about time someone stepped up and started talking about the hard things in life. When you graduate, so much of my life was in chaos while trying to understand the world and get my feet underneath me. These guys tackle a lot of what keeps young adults down in a hilarious and vulnerable way. I love it! Helped remind me that I'm not the only person struggling but everything will be okay. Keep it up guys I'll be listening!
- Nate Lieberman"
2894,Moonwalk,Great combination of wit and important topics for millennials,5,"Mohnish does an amazing job of covering critical topics while also being hysterical! This is a well produced, on target podcast - obviously done by professionals who care about the craft. Highly recommend for any millennial!"
2895,Moonwalk,Awesome!,5,Love listening to the show every week. The guys always bring a lot of fun and energy to every topic. Makes car rides feel like a conversation with friends
2896,Moonwalk,Listen to this podcast,5,"Real Talk is fantastic - it's nuanced, raw, funny, and relevant. The guys talk about real issues, and are honest and vulnerable in ways that is sometimes startling. It's clear that even beyond all of the research that clearly went into this podcast, these guys are thoughtful about how they navigate the world personally. On top of that, there are laugh out loud moments and actual actionable advice - a combination that is pretty rare. Listen to this podcast. It's great."
2897,Moonwalk,Swag,5,Legit. Its refreshing and real and everything I've ever wanted from Momo
2898,Moonwalk,Awesome Podcast,5,Great outlook on experiences from growing up in america. Very well done
2899,Moonwalk,Ridiculously relatable,5,Finally a podcast that we can relate to in this day and age. Mohnish really has done his research-so listening to this podcast is refreshing & you can tell it is well thought out. Can't wait for the next episode to come out!
2900,Moonwalk,Witty and Relatable,5,"From the host to the co-hosts, each one holds their own and has something to bring to the table. The stories are hilarious just as much as they are informational. I will definitely continue to tune in."
2901,Moonwalk,Very thoughtful and a must-listen for High school students,5,Excellent podcast. The voice is unique. It is clearly differentiated from other podcasts via the intellectual yet relatable and entertaining tone. Great job guys!
2902,Moonwalk,Worth taking time out of my day to listen to,5,"This certainly isn‚Äôt just another podcast circulating iTunes. Instead of relying solely personality and quick jokes (which, thankfully, are nonetheless present), these guys take an angle that proves to be more relatable and engaging than a podcast too shy to dare to explore its own identity. Although the series is still in its infancy, it‚Äôs clear that the direction and focus is in the exact place that it wants to be. 'Real Talk‚Äô should continue to impress moving forward."
2903,Moonwalk,These guys are great,5,"The insight I've gotten so far has been out of control. An absurd amount of knowledge is shared. I wish I had this resource in high school.
Lastly, Skeeps"
2904,Moonwalk,You need to listen to this,5,"Not only was this entertaining all the way, it offered a lot of beneficial information I wish I had while growing up. Definitely worth the listen."
2905,Moonwalk,Outrageous Fun,5,"Apparent from the very start, the quality of Real Talk is obvious. It's funny, informative, incredibly relatable, and most importantly, genuine. I wish I could have stumbled upon something like this in high school."
2906,Moonwalk,Hilarious and Relatable,5,"These guys are hilarious, talking about relevant issues in high school or for young adults and relating it to their lives!
Definitely recommend listening! I'm excited to listen to more of their podcasts in the future!"
2907,Moonwalk,"A Fun, but Serious Look at a Familiar yet Unpopular Topic",5,"This is legit plain and simple.
You need to struggle and learn in order to grow so why not reflect on the entire process of growing up?"
2908,Moonwalk,A Breath of Fresh Air,5,"Currently a high school student, Real Talk provides a relatable, pragmatic look into the social conventions around me."
2909,Moonwalk,Love it,5,Great flow to the shown. Funny and relevant topics from ppl from our generation with good minds!
2910,Moonwalk,The conversations that matter,5,"Entering adulthood can be a scary thing, and oftentimes the conversations that are most important for helping us grow and mature can be the most difficult to have. These three bring an open and honest approach to these subjects with relatable anecdotes and overall hilarity! Bitchin podcast!"
2911,Moonwalk,Growing Up is Still Growing Up,5,Fabulous blog and one of the few I have heard that I will be back for more. Enjoyed the banter and raw conversation between these 3 on topics that are real to the challenging years of High School. Keep it up!
2912,Moonwalk,Keep ‚Äòem coming,5,"Hilarious podcast between these 3 friends. They are able to discuss real topics for the 15-25 age group while being able to have fun and make jokes. These guys work well together and are able to bounce off one another effortlessly. No matter the age, you‚Äôl enjoy this‚Äîkeep up the good work guys!"
2913,Moonwalk,wow!,5,"I am a middle-aged woman who wanted to stay in tune to what my son might need help with upon entering high school. These guys are funny, reflective, inviting, cool, and most of all insightful.
I have been telling all the middle school and high school kids I know to check it out.
Hope you all like it as much as I did- good job guys!
Jill"
2914,Moonwalk,Comfortably Addictive,5,"This podcast successfully voices the inner thoughts and conflicts of every 17 - 25 year old growing up in America in a humorous way. After discovering this podcast, I find myself trying to find times where I can listen to this during downtime of my day. The content is so relatable I feel like I'm sitting in the room talking to a group of my guy friends."
2915,Moonwalk,"""My (expletive) is in a glass box inside your room"" Actual Real Talk Quote",5,"Real Talk is the conversation you wish you were a part of. In a time when discussion has devolved into ""Sup's"" and ""What's good's"", it is refreshing to sit in on the dialogue of coherent, enterprising, yet undeniably college millenials. Their entertaining exhange over the hot topics relevant to the range of youths and established folks alike is interspersed with vignettes of well researched material that will make you say, ""Oh, (expletive). That's true."" Listen for advice on finding yourself. Listen for closure on your awkward adolescence. Listen to understand your children and the rest of Generation Y. For whatever reason, just give it a listen."
2916,Moonwalk,So flames,5,If podcasts were memes I'd put this podcast in my top 10 memes
2917,Brain Matters,Love this podcast!,5,I am a post-bac researcher getting ready to apply to graduate school in neuroscience. It can be over whelming at times and listening to this podcast has really helped me feel invigorated in the search for the right program. I love hearing about the research and I think the hosts ask great questions. I also love getting to hear some more personal stories and insight from the professors that they interview. Thanks for the great work!
2918,Brain Matters,A must-listen for neuroscientists,5,"Very informative podcast, the host asks excellent questions and has some very high-caliber experts in the field as guests. They do get into the nitty-gritty technical parts of neuroscience, which I personally love. However, this could be difficult for people outside of biology.
Amazing podcast overall! Highly recommend."
2919,Brain Matters,Awesome!,5,And caretaker band great. Thank You!
2920,Brain Matters,My review,5,"I‚Äôve subscribed to over twelve specialized neuroscience podcasts over the years. I can say without reservation (2019-01-16) that I turn to yours FIRST, as my most important and my most entertaining podcast. I even enjoy the music. I‚Äôve learned to trust you guys so much that I‚Äôve embarked on a journey to listen to every past show, even though initially it seemed of little interest. But the cochlear joke? I‚Äôve HEARD quite enough of that lately. It SOUNDS to me like you need a new line."
2921,Brain Matters,So good,5,Love this pod.
2922,Brain Matters,Great,5,A great example of interesting and effective science communication!
2923,Brain Matters,So special,5,"This has quickly become one of my favorite podcasts! The hosts have conversations with some of the top working neuroscientists around. There's one interviewee per session so we get to hear not only about the surface level details of the work, but also a more human level of how (and why) the research was accomplished."
2924,Brain Matters,Love your podcasts!!,5,"Thank you for running this podcasts! i am an undergraduate trying to get into this field, and your podcasts brighthen my pathway to the right door. Thank you and please keep doing it!"

2932,Brain Matters,Awesome!,5,"I'm a huge fan of this podcast. I'm an RA getting ready to apply to PhD programs in Neuroscience and this podcast has not only kept me motivated and excited to apply, but it's introduced me to so many new labs and areas of research!"
2933,Brain Matters,Uniquely Informative,5,"It's one thing to learn about the most fascinating thing in the universe, but to also learn about how these scientists got started and why they chose neuroscience‚Äîis fantastic! I love every episode. Thank you!"
2934,Brain Matters,As prescribed for the noggin,5,Neuroscience through the eyes of today‚Äôs pioneers. Great podcast for anyone and everyone interested in learning of developments and advances in the neuro world.
2935,Brain Matters,Great podcast for anyone interested in neuroscience or getting involved,5,I love this podcast. I'm interested in grad school in an interdisciplinary neuroscience-esque field and this is extremely valuable in terms of career advice and how to navigate research career paths. The conversations feel a lot like conversations and not just rigid q and a sessions which make this podcast so much more personable. I'm still going through and listening to all the episodes from previous years but I wonder if you could get any researcher working in transhumanism/neuroprosthetics as a guest?
2936,Brain Matters,Great podcast,5,"As a current neurobiology grad student, I look forward to your podcast. I listen during my commutes. Keep up the great work."
2937,Brain Matters,Great podcast,5,The hosts make neuroscience research accessible. I never miss an episode.

2939,Brain Matters,Obsessed!,5,"These guys are awesome! Definitely an addictive podcast not just because I love neuroscience, but all of the different interviews that are conducted on different neuroscientists. It give me better insight on the different viewpoints as well as the topics they study."
2940,Brain Matters,Awesome podcast,5,This is one of the best neuroscience podcasts I have come across. I am just a high school student who is interested in neuroscience and these podcasts are both interesting and easy to understand. Listen to them regularly. Keep the podcasts coming!
2941,Brain Matters,Congrats on your SFN award!!,5,Congrats on your SFN award!!
2942,Brain Matters,A nice time with headphones,5,"Without question, my favorite neuroscience podcast. These folk are as entertaining as they are informational. The best!"
2943,Brain Matters,Great Podcast!,5,"My brain knowledge was in the negatives but after listening to this podcast for a couple months I'm finally approaching zero. What I mean is, I am beginning to understand what I don't know. I find the research fascinating and the brief scientist bios intriguing."
2944,Brain Matters,Perkedy perk,5,"Hey, Guys!
I am Certified Surgical Technologist in neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and I have really enjoyed your podcast! I got a relatively late start academically and it's inspiring to hear your interviewees talk about their paths to Science. My cochlea are so PERKED! Thank you for the brain food, keep it up!"
2945,Brain Matters,One Episode Down..,5,"Just listened to ""Space and Time with Dr. Mayank Mehta."" This podcast is fantastic! High quality information from people who really are passionate about the universe. Excited to listen to more!"
2946,Brain Matters,BEST EVER,5,"I love this podcast!!!
The hosts ask great questions (not just about the research but about how the scientist got to where he/she is, etc) The podcast cover a wide variety of neuro research pretty in depth, but still manages to add hints of funny, which makes it even more fun to listen to than other science ‚Äòcasts out there"
2947,The Food Chain,Tasty!,5,"What a delicious podcast! Interviews, recipes, experiences, even beer! (There's food in beer, there is no beer in food.) Keep up the great work."
2948,The Food Chain,Hello from a new fan,5,"I appreciate the depth and variety of food related topics, not your every day (look at me style) podcast.
I also hear caring, deep interest and compassion in Greer‚Äôs style of interview.
Thank You.
Please consider speaking with my favorite award winning small miso company in the U.S. called South River Miso in Conway Massachusetts ."
2949,The Food Chain,Simon,5,"Wonderful. I‚Äôm heading to Netflix next to enjoy her show. Writing and cooking, great combination !"
2950,The Food Chain,No two are the same,5,I never know what to expect but each episode is so interesting. I love the chefs life in 5 dishes. Brilliant!
2951,The Food Chain,Interesting & Informative,5,"This podcast is the only food-related show that focuses on the business, technology, and culture of food. This unique perspective has been very enlightening. I want to know where my food comes from and how it is processed and this show has answered many of those questions and more. I also appreciate the cultural significance of food that is discussed on this show. Give it a listen!"
2952,The Food Chain,I would love to give this podcast 5 stars...but,4,"Superb podcast as far as content, reporting, attitude, and topics.
Why did I take one star away?
Because the music can be intrusive and jarring at times.
I will keep listening, but I find this in many ""over-produced"" podcasts: the music is too noticeable. It's not the main feature of the podcast; nor, is it what people are generally coming to the podcast to hear. I believe most uf us are there for the content and intellectual fodder."
2953,The Food Chain,The Food Chain,5,"Excellent programme. The show presents an informative and very interesting view of what is happening in our food manufacturing and food supply. A must listen, if you care about what you eat."
2954,The Food Chain,Absolutely Love It!,5,"I enjoy the fact that they talk about food in terms of science, culture and more adding depth to the subject - definitely food for thought literally."
2955,The Food Chain,Not for those with a weak stomach. But very informative,5,But very informative
2956,The Food Chain,So good!,5,"If you eat or buy or have ever seen food, the Food Chain is for you. Lively hosts share the ins and outs of our mysterious global food chain and explore curiosities and consequences along the way. I appreciate that they present left, right, and center perspectives. Start from the beginning! It's already changed the way I buy, cook, eat, and (no longer) throw out food."
2957,The Food Chain,Surprisingly awesome,5,"Awesome show with great insights and stories. Usually I am distracted/annoyed by British accents, but this show host is surprisingly tolerable."
2958,The Food Chain,Informative and Entertaining!,5,"I love food science and news, so this podcast seems made for me. The topics are interesting and are usually issues that affect everyone (not just people in to food). This would be a great learning tool. It's important to know these things!"
2959,The Food Chain,Love it!,5,"Covers tech, social, cultural, ethical, practical, scientific, and just about all other aspects of food. Great for ppl intensely interested not just in enjoying foods but also the back stories and implications of them.
They interview key and relevant people, and the program is generally very objective."
2960,New England Journal of Medicine Interviews,Very informative,5,Thank you for easy and convenient way to keep us updated. And share interesting cases
2961,New England Journal of Medicine Interviews,Interview Titles,4,"These audio interviews are great however I would like to make a observation/recommendation. My observation is that in most cases when deciding which podcast to listen to the topic is more important then the author. Because of the format of the podcast listings in iTunes, the author is always visible, but the topic is almost always truncated. Therefore, my suggestion would be to list the topic title before the author in the list of available podcasts."
2962,New England Journal of Medicine Interviews,Thee are great!,5,"Managing Editor Stephen Morrissey does a great job of condensing an in-depth and interesting gem of an interview into just a few minutes, perfect for your commute."
2963,New England Journal of Medicine Interviews,These are wonderful!,5,I've been listening to these on my commute. They're great and usually informative.

Tom does an incredible job leading conversations that cover the entire range of mental, emotional, spiritual and physical challenges we all face learning to reconnect with an authentic style of living that doesn‚Äôt drain Earth‚Äôs resources (or leave us worse-off). Highly recommend listening and subscribing!"
2965,Costing the Earth,Interesting and Eye-opening!,5,"Thank you so much for producing this show! As an ardent environmentalist, I can‚Äôt wait until the next episode gets posted.

2966,Costing the Earth,Meaningful engagement with environmental topics,4,An excellent and engaging perspective on to-the-minute environmental topics.
2967,Costing the Earth,Excellent environmental journalism,5,I have been listening to the programme since it first aired on BBC4. It's an excellent show with a broad range of environmental topics and the journalists are superb. My only gripe is that it's not broadcast live at a later time of day and that it's not on for more than half an hour.
2968,Costing the Earth,Great show,5,Very informative. I'd like to hear more from this show--like increase the number of shows per year or go to a full hour.
2969,"People Behind the Science Podcast - Stories from Scientists about Science, Life, Research, and Science Careers",Excellent episode with Dr. Weiner,5,"The cancer research (and successes!) that you illustrated in your interview has definitely given me hope, as David wished. If I need to wrestle with cancer yet again, I‚Äôm glad he and his colleagues have my back."
2970,"People Behind the Science Podcast - Stories from Scientists about Science, Life, Research, and Science Careers",Knowledgeable; Introspective on true elites.,3,"I‚Äôve now binged on 300 episodes over two months. There is a lot of exciting research being done! It is fun to get a few tid-bits on what researchers are doing both in academia and private sectors.
What I have found in all the episodes thus far, is that I have yet to hear of a person who‚Äôs had an average or low income upbringing.
Every person interviewed has a large pedigree of top notch schooling. That isn‚Äôt bad but it is very telling that only a certain slice of people behind the science are being interviewed.
Most hobbies I‚Äôve heard are the same highbrow type responses and it gets old quick.
The series isn‚Äôt as inspirational as it is semi informative. I see it more as a way for people to brag a bit about what they are doing rather than showing that they are not robots. That‚Äôs my opinion though! I‚Äôll listen for interesting research topics, that‚Äôs all, though I could just view reddit."
2971,"People Behind the Science Podcast - Stories from Scientists about Science, Life, Research, and Science Careers",First experience with science,5,"My daughters 8th birthday, she received a microscope, she is hooked, she enjoys me bringing home dead bugs to magnify. She is keeping a journal of everything she sees at the different magnifications. We have been listening to podcast for years at bed time. This is one that doesn‚Äôt put her right to sleep. It is super gratifying watching her as she is excited about the things she is ‚Äúdiscovering ‚Äú OK so I am not a smart man, you could say I never lived up to my potential. All that being said thank you for this podcast and giving her examples of how to become a scientist and me a direction that I can help her along. You are the best. If possible say hi to Landrey Lyn, last name withheld. Thank you for giving a smart kid with dumb parents an avenue to learn to keep moving forward in science."

2973,"People Behind the Science Podcast - Stories from Scientists about Science, Life, Research, and Science Careers",Perfect interviews,5,Dr. McNeely has a very nice interview style.

2998,"People Behind the Science Podcast - Stories from Scientists about Science, Life, Research, and Science Careers",Excellent,5,Great and unique perspective!- provides insight into both the research product and process
2999,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Hit and Miss,3,"I think Shannon is a great interviewer with a particular talent for making guests feel at ease and understood. She effortlessly matches up with the differing personalities of the guests and draws out the best in their stories. This is the greatest strength of the show.
However, I‚Äôve been listening for a couple weeks now, and a ton of the show seems to be dedicated to catch-up time between buddies, where they discuss which movies each one has and hasn‚Äôt seen and occasionally drop teenage edgelord opinions like, ‚ÄúPeople that listen to pop music must be uncreative, mindless drones.‚Äù
This happens between hosts and sometimes with guests, who also often seem to be friends. I can‚Äôt imagine who would care about this, besides a handful of folks who are intimately enmeshed within this community and know who all these people are. Maybe this ‚Äòcast isn‚Äôt designed to have a broad appeal, and it‚Äôs a me problem rather than a them problem!
I forget the episode, but there was also a jarringly transphobic discussion that happened in one of these chatty intro segments. The episode was a few years old, and it seemed to come from a place of ignorance rather than malice, but it still makes ya cringe to hear it.
I‚Äôm going to continue to listen, because the interview segments can be truly great, but it‚Äôs frustrating to have to fast forward through the first half of each episode or more."
3000,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Zero stars,1,Anyone who advocates ‚Äúlicking‚Äù public surfaces in order to contract COVID-19 ‚Äúand get over it‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt have access to any audience. Despicable.

3002,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Love this show,5,Always interesting stories from real people. Not always someone pushing a book or a movie which is fine but it‚Äôs the fact that Shannon gives real people a chance to tell their experiences that has kept me listening off and on for years now.

3009,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Audio quality,5,Love the podcast but please fix your sound quality. The first episode sounds better than the more recent ones. It sounds like a faulty connection or static whenever someone speaks.

The host is a good interviewer and the whole thing is very good quality. Some of the spooky pods I have tried sound like drunk teenagers just goofing around with a microphone, but this is not one of those! The topics are great and she does a nice job talking to guests about their experiences. Going to the top of my list! (And thanks to Jim Harold‚Äôs Paranormal Podcast for introducing me to this one. )"
3014,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,"Well, that‚Äôs tacky",2,"I heard an episode for the first time today and right before the end they cut the interview and a weird automated voice says if you want to hear more pay... I mean, really? Could you be more subtle? I immediately unsubscribed."
3015,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,The best Paranormal Podcast!,5,"I have listened to so many podcasts involving the paranormal, Bigfoot and UFO‚Äôs. I couldn‚Äôt find one to settle on with consistency and unbiased interviews. I found this one and haven‚Äôt looked back yet. I still listen to my old ones, but this one is number 1 in my podcast library. Intriguing and thought provoking. Real people talking about their experiences."

3017,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Ugh!,1,She‚Äôs really full of herself. Tried listening to her and couldn‚Äôt stand listening to her corny jokes.

It‚Äôs a perfect blend of all the subjects that fascinate me: Bigfoot, Cryptids, Ghosts, UFO‚Äôs, etc. Shanon gets great guests and does her homework. While allowing the guest to tell their story or discuss their topic of expertise, she will ask informed, poignant questions that keeps the conversation flowing and gleans as much insight as possible to sate my curiosity of the subject being discussed. I highly recommend listening and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll quickly become one if your favorite podcasts too!"
3019,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Kind of boring,2,Not very good compared to the other shows...
3020,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Love this podcast !!!!,5,"Shannon is such an awesome interviewer.

Thank you for being such an awesome host !!!"
3021,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,I remembered why I stopped listening,1,"WOW!

3023,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Great information and guests!!,5,iTF 218 which Allen Watts one is playing at the end of the episode?
3024,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Good podcast but,3,I wish the host of this show would let her guests complete a thought every now and then without interrupting them. Or speaking for them or trying to complete their sentences. It gets quite annoying at times. (Episode 190) audio was glitchy as well. If these things changed I‚Äôd give 5 stars but..
3025,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Shannon is the Bomb!,5,Hands down my favorite podcast touching on all things paranormal and Cryptid! Great content presented with no BS! Real people telling real story‚Äôs with no judgment ! Keep it up
3026,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Shannon rocks,5,Into the Fray is a great podcast. Shannon has created a great forum for people to tell what can be deeply personal stories. She treats them all with respect and is great at navigating her way through an interview. There‚Äôs been some super creepy stories told on ITF and has always been my favorite.
3027,iNTO THE FRAY RADIO - An Encounter with the Abyss that is the Paranormal,Love love love this show!,5,Shannon does an amazing job! Fascinating topics and interesting guests. Keep up the great work!

3029,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Intro is death otherwise incredible,5,This podcast is awesome! Sometimes I have to listen to the questions twice because I like to read thrones but honestly the questions are so great and the explanation is amazing. My teachers in pa school even steal his questions for exams
3030,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Indispensable,5,"After I got used to skipping the intro, the core content is consistently high quality. Ive listened multiple times thru!"
3031,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Fast paced,4,Super helpful in the last month of preparing for the pance. He goes fast though! A couple extra seconds between question and answer would be helpful.
3032,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Awful intro,3,It‚Äôs good but his intro and music is awful once you‚Äôve heard it 10 times. Stopped listening d/t how annoying the intro outro are. Plus sells smarty pance too much and wastes time with commercials for it.
3033,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,THE BEST!,5,Please keep Joe on the website and everything else! He makes my life so much easier !!! PLEASE! I enjoyed his cardio pharm!!! I like his teaching! He is awesome just like you !!! üôåüèæüôåüèæ
3034,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Best thing!,5,"When you just wanna listen to some questions about the PANCE either during a workout or commute to a rotation, this is it! Exactly what I need to get my brain thinking and see what I need to work on. Thank you!"
3035,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Incredibly helpful,5,"I'm studying for what I hope will be my last PANRE before retirement. I lucked into finding this podcast and the associated website and IMMEDIATELY plunked down my money for a subscription. There is a TON of content here, and it's organized in a logical and helpful way. I've always found that going through lots of exam questions was the best way to review and this site has plenty with very few errors or discrepancies. Way to go!"
3036,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Interactive learning,5,Love these Q&A podcasts. It's a little easier to pay attention/stay focused interact since multiple choices are provided.
3037,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Love this podcast,5,"Great high yield review especially while driving, walking, working out or whatever else you may be doing"
3038,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,great resource,5,"This podcast is great for when driving or when you can't have your head in a book. I had it on in the car, kitchen, and shower. Episodes are short and sweet. I got all the episodes by purchasing the Academy from the PA Life website to prep for taking the PANCE. This is one of the resources I used to study and i'm happy to say I passed the PANCE in my first attempt. thank you Stephen!"
3039,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Great Work!,5,This is exactly what it says it is. That is the beauty of this podcast. It is 10 exam type question that you can listen to on the go!
3040,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Great questions for review,5,Thanks for the great website and awesome podcast questions! Always helpful to hear the questions out loud and explained.
3041,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Excellent study tool!!,5,"This podcast is awesome! Each episode is under 10 minutes, and goes through 10 multiple choice questions similar to those you would find on the PANCE or PACRE (or PACKRAT for those of you still in school). Each question has 4 answer choices, followed by the correct answer and a brief explanation.
Why do I love this podcast?
1. I find it hard to pay attention to long monologues on one topic. This podcast has short snippets of varied information.
2. The listener is involved by mentally answering the questions as they are asked.
3. If you do lose concentration for a minute (I listen while driving, so sometimes traffic can be a distraction) you can just pick up at the next question. Because the questions are different, they dont build on each other so you can still learn if you miss one.
4. They are brief and to-the-point.. I often drive short 10-15 minute trips, just enough time to listen to an entire podcast.
5. Stephen Pasquini (the creator) adds clinical information when test answers are different from real life. So you get to learn how to answer on an exam and what to do when you see it in real life.
6. The questions are similar to those found on the actual PANCE, so it's a good method for studying.
The only downside to this podcast is the number of episodes available. More please, Mr. Pasquini!!!"
3042,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Perfect for the road.,5,"For all of the commuters and everyone else in between, these podcasts really optimize the time spent on the road and bring a good interaction bit to the table. Thank you so much for the hard work put into these."
3043,The Audio PANCE AND PANRE Physician Assistant Board Review Podcast,Great study tool,5,"This is a great way to get review questions in! Some of his questions are exactly like the ones from the old Packrat questions, which are high yield! Highly recommend!"
3044,The Confessionals,So good,5,"This is by far my favorite podcast so far. I just started listening to podcasts last week for the first time. I am so addicted to your show. I have a few stories myself that are very early. I have some personal expertise along with pagans and witches. I‚Äôve seen some really weird things living in the mountains of Sonora, CA. From strange elf like anomalies, to witches in the wood, all the way down to a triangle shaped ufo in the sky that almost made me want to follow it up the hill. I would stop myself from following this craft because I know that if I did I would never be seen again.
Great Show
Keep it up
And stay skeptical"
3045,The Confessionals,Too political,2,The host is basically pushing dangerous conspiracy theories... when he does not it is fun to listen until he starts talking about politics and all other crazy staff....
3046,The Confessionals,ABSOLUTE SECOND BEST PODCAST!!!,5,"Tony is hands down the second best podcaster out there (Wes Germer being ‚Äúthe best‚Äù), what a show! The Confessionals is a two-in-a million podcast (Sasquatch Chronicles being one-in-a million). If your not a member of The Confessionals, you are missing out FOR SURE... (If your not a member of Sasquatch Chronicles, you are an idiot)!!!
Oh Tony, lighten up I‚Äôm just messin with ya! (Except for the part about Wes Germer & Sasquatch Chronicles)..."
3047,The Confessionals,‚ù§Ô∏è I confess‚ù§Ô∏è,5,"It‚Äôs just getting better and better!! This is what really makes a person think. You can only think so much before you begin act.
Okay so I have to ask you-Rather BEG you to please please please Stop with the 5 minute ads!!
I can‚Äôt afford to join so please Stop it Already!!!!!"
3048,The Confessionals,Best podcast,5,In my top 3 favorite podcasts. Tony really does an awesome job finding the most interesting topics and guests. I üß° this podcast. The truth is hard to find but he sifts through it for us. I also recommend Macroaggessions by Charlie
3049,The Confessionals,New fav podcast,5,Greatest source of first hand paranormal info since Coast 2 Coast AM. Very entertaining. Amazing production which is rare imo. I‚Äôm addicted. I haven‚Äôt listened to another podcast since I found this. 5 stars.
3050,The Confessionals,Love the show!,5,"Found the show through Sasquatch Chronicles, I loved hearing Tony on Wes‚Äôs show and had to come listen to his show. I‚Äôm addicted, whether I‚Äôm driving or just chilling at home, I‚Äôm listening!"
3051,The Confessionals,Love the show,5,I love how tony gives everyone a chance to tell their story without interrupting them without judgement and asks all the questions at the end. Over all love hearing his opinions and thoughts and love the show. Keep it up.
3052,The Confessionals,Susan Lindauer,5,"I can‚Äôt believe how this woman hysterically laughed through her whole presentation. It sure would be nice if she showed a little reverence, i mean after all, were talking about high treason and murder here."
3053,The Confessionals,For the love of god...,3,MA-LEV-O-LENT
3054,The Confessionals,By far the BEST in the Strange Encounters world,5,Excellent. Don‚Äôt listen to the negative Nancy‚Äôs!
3055,The Confessionals,Ok...,2,"This show can be really good when it‚Äôs not about conspiracy theories or big foot encounters, which seems to be the host‚Äôs cup of tea.
I actually enjoy the paranormal stuff, but do not care for Tony‚Äôs opinion on pretty much everything he has to say every time he has a guest.
The last episode and now THIS ONE is another conspiracy theory mamba jamba of him rambling about how he thinks this was planned.
I for one, am concerned about the virus, but wish I could listen to anything else other than Covid-19 from my favorite podcast."
3056,The Confessionals,Greatest Podcast,5,"I love how he covers to many different subjects, he is one of best interviewers and just a great soul! Anyone who gives him a rude message over anything he says, is an idiot! For those pathetic idiots giving him a rude messages, get a life! It‚Äôs a free podcast. Block these losers!"
3057,The Confessionals,Lost in the Smokies,3,Just get on with the freakin story and quit repeating yourself geez
3058,The Confessionals,Coronavirus,5,"I followe Guo Wengui and he's been talking about coronavirus since mid November. I started preparing then, Thanks for the show."
3059,The Confessionals,Agree!,5,"I don‚Äôt understand how people can not see how serious this virus is, but I still hear co workers dismiss the statistics of this virus. Agree we should be cautious and take this seriously."
3060,The Confessionals,Great show!,5,Keep up the great work! Your feelings on covid 19 are felt exactly by me. You‚Äôre not crazy!
3061,The Confessionals,Fringle friendly,3,"I like Tony, but I wonder, if he is anti catholic and a lot of his guests talk good. However, where is the poof? Claiming satanic sex cult, but show no poof. But this series talks about ufos and big foot. So it really true tradition media. I like it for interesting topic, but I am left wondering, dose Tony believe this crap? Keep up shows, I am fan, but I am very skeptical and advise other to be. He never show prove to these accusations."
3062,The Confessionals,The confessionals podcast,5,"Really like this podcast. It has a good mixture of stories that are interesting. I like how you speak of your Christian faith with out shoving it down peoples throats. I appreciate your hard work and the podcasts too. May the Lord bless you and your family and keep you all safe!
Thanks,
Steve Hoover üëç"
3063,The Confessionals,Interesting show from a gnostic perspective,5,"It used to be a great show. I‚Äôm a former Patreon supporter. Unfortunately it‚Äôs gone down hill. It‚Äôs almost as if he thinks we want to hear him speak instead of the guests.
The guests? Bill Schnoebelen? David Icke? Really? These clowns have been debunked years ago.
Be like Wes. Get out of your way and stop believing you‚Äôre the reason people listen. At least screen your guests and do a little research on them."
3064,The Confessionals,Ok when Tony isn‚Äôt talking too much,3,"There are some interesting stories from time to time. I‚Äôm not stating wether or not they are real or believable because they are entertaining. It seems apparent that when Tony, the host, starts to give his opinion you are subjected to free form ramblings. It gets a little long winded, not thought out and I feel like I‚Äôm going cross-eyed. Sometimes the guest can be a little too raw as well (keeping it real at least). Best to cherry pick which episodes you listen to and don‚Äôt be afraid to hit next."
3065,The Confessionals,Please Fix Audio,5,"Been listening for awhile. Good show. However lately the audio in the podcast seems to go out or skip during conversations. It sounds like someone has the remote to the tv and they keep hitting mute on and off throughout the show. This has been going on for at least a few months I‚Äôd say. I even spoke with friends and family who listen and they all say the same thing. It‚Äôs getting harder to listen to cause it makes you miss key details in conversations. We all use Apple Podcasts app too so idk if that has anything to do with it. Please update us on this Tony, thanks."
3066,The Confessionals,Great show.,5,This show Sometimes legit creeps me out. He does a great job. I‚Äôm glad I heard about it.
3067,The Confessionals,YUP!!,5,"Love the show! Unlike some shows where the host continually cuts the guest off, you actually let them tell the whole story and then ask intelligent questions about their experience. Keep up the good work! Listen every night."
3068,The Confessionals,Yup!!!,5,"Tony is an awesome host and the stories are mind blowing! Keep it up Tony, this Bluegrass girl loves ya!"
3069,The Confessionals,Awesome,5,Awesome
3070,The Confessionals,Fantastic! Keeps we awake on the job,5,Great stories and a wide variety of perspectives. I love how Tony just lets the interviewees talk. He asks just a few questions for clarification. Keep up the great work! Love the mash-up music.
3071,The Confessionals,One of the Best podcast!,5,"It‚Äôs a tie for 1st place when it come to podcasts between The Confessionals and Sasquatch Chronicles! Tony , keep doing a great job! It forces Wes to be better and the people are the ones that reap the benefits!"
3072,The Confessionals,Awesome show!,5,Doing great work Tony! Love the latest episode having stories from my hometown area down in Louisiana! Keep up the great work and God Bless!
3073,The Confessionals,Reminded,5,"Real short. Work thirds, listener for a year, put my faith in God last, now he is first. Had my own experiences when I was young. Became a lost soul as I got older, was grasping for something tangible to hold on to in my life, and this podcast reminded me of my faith in God. I am so great full I stumbled onto this podcast. I once again sat down with my Bible, which I have not done in 20yrs. I prayed and asked God to remind me, and he lead me immediately, first verse, to psalms 116.
Thank you,
Lisa"
3074,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Good info,2,"Great podcast to stay up to date; engaging and informative.
The only downside is that the audio mixing is aggressively bad: the speakers are often very soft, requiring me to turn up the volume. Every few minutes the ‚Äútransitional sound‚Äù of drums then plays, which in contrast is so loud it‚Äôs physically painful. Unless this gets fixed I can‚Äôt imagine myself recommending this (otherwise great) podcast to anyone else."
3075,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,The ring of truth is fading fast.,1,"That‚Äôs it for me on this entire podcast.
Starting to sound like this woman just loves the sound of her voice. I can‚Äôt afford to listen anymore.
Cheryl needs to quit drinking and repeating herself over and over and over.
Get some help before you put you daughter up again on the block.
You get help before you can help others."
3076,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Thanks!,4,Great find! I‚Äôm family medicine- love the succinct review. Super useful info.
3077,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Fix volume please!,4,"MS2 here, currently on my peds clerkship. I love the cases and the education I get from these podcasts, but y‚Äôall really could work on your volume editing! Some of your episodes have the sound so faint that I have to turn the volume all the way up, then deal with my eardrums getting shattered when I get another notification. It‚Äôs not all episodes, just some of them with quieter speakers.
Otherwise love the cast, would be perfect with that one fix!"
3078,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Great,5,Concise info for pediatric cases.
3079,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Reading text = monotonous,2,"While these podcasts are factually accurate and written well, the presentation of material is extraordinarily boring for someone that actually enjoys the subject. I do not understand why the production of this podcast had to be so poorly executed. The production teams to have just read off a page that they could have much more easily posted to a website on the internet and saved them production time. Ugh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to go subscribe to a journal with a bit more production value."
3080,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Great and straight forward Peds information for medical students!,5,Detailed enough to understand and present the information I've learned to my attendings but short enough that I can listen to the episodes on my way home from work! Thanks!
3081,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Great!,5,Listened to these in the car on the way to and from my clerkship and loved them! Nice overview of peds bread and butter. Looking forward to more episodes.
3082,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,clinical pearls!,5,keep up the great work! really interesting and brain storming
3083,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Great podcast for more than just students!,5,"As a Peds Oncology RN, I found this podcast to be a great refresher on topics that I do not see everyday, but feel that I still need to keep up to date. It is excellent information in a short amount of time, making it easily understood and retained. Please keep them coming."
3084,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Great for the wards,5,"These cases are succient enough to listen to on my ride to and from the hospital, but also have all the info that's expected of me as a third year med student. Keep up the great work and I'm looking forward to more cases!"
3085,Pedscases.com: Pediatrics for Medical Students,Pedcases,5,"These pedscases are excellent, current, and literature based. I am practicing physician assistant in emergency medicine for over 20 years and a PALS instructor. These pedcases have helped me as a clinician and as a teacher. How about a nice current discussion on bronchiolitis! Excellent job to all! Thank you Dave W. PA"
3086,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,COVID Cast,5,The best up to date review of the pandemic from a practical clinical perspective. They are reviewing data almost daily with an honest appraisal and frequently cautioning you from drawing strong conclusions.
3087,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Giving a shout out to the PAs,5,"I have been a long time listener to your podcast. I enjoy the update on new information coupled with core content. I was excited to hear the specific shout out to PAs today by Jeremy Faust. Thanks
Dave PA-C"
3088,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Covid,5,Thanks so much for keeping up with updates/evidence ! Very appreciative!
3089,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Stick with medical teaching,4,Information is usually useful. Could do without sarcastic anti-American comments.
3090,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Relevant Concise,5,"As an NP and former ER RN, I really enjoyed this thoughtful, practical and well researched podcast. Bonus points for the camaraderie between the hosts and the fact that these are fairly short and detail packed."
3091,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Outstanding,5,"Very pleasant to listen to and excellent choices of subjects
Always take away some relevant knowledge
And I have been doing this a long time
üëª"
3092,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Helpful and easy to retain,5,"I like the back and forth of two presenters, helps me retain the info they share. Not as opinionated as other em podcasts if that's important to you. I like a mix of very opinionated to ""Let's give you all the options."""
3093,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Excellent review,5,"Concise, accurate, practical."
3094,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Great core content,5,"This has been one of my favorite podcasts throughout residency, relevant and to the point. Thanks!"

3097,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Humorous but Solid,5,"Great podcast, light and joking mood, but solid and serious pearls and information. Keep up the great work."
3098,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Best educational medical podcast,5,"I am third-year medical student, always on the lookout for clear explanations of difficult topics that I encounter in my clinical medicine education. These guys are able to help me understand topics that are difficult for me in an efficient way. Also, the way they set up their podcast shows me that they respect my time. They don't waste 5 to 10 minutes at the beginning of their half hour podcast with long music preludes or introducing themselves and what they're going to talk about. They find a way to be entertaining without wasting my time. I also appreciate that they don't often do interviews, which helps the sound quality of the podcast, and my ability to actually hear and understand it in the car on the way to work. It's easy to perceive that they prepare very well for the recordings by the minimal amount of dead airtime that is so common in other podcasts. Thank you guys for this gem! I hope to be listening for a long time to come."
3099,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,@pedsemdoc,5,Excellent FOAM podcast.
3100,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Thank You For Your Work,5,Great pod cast!!!

3109,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Amazing resource!,5,As a medical student this is a great resource for up to date information on EM! Love the way the hosts tell it with a joke here and there
3110,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Great podcast,5,"I really enjoy listen to this podcast while driving. They use Rosen's and Tintinalli's textbooks as a reference which is good for me since I'm a student and my program uses them for class. Listening has also improved how I critique research articles.
Jeremy's cheesy jokes and Lauren's accent are a bonus to the great FOAM in this podcast. 5‚≠êÔ∏è"
3111,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Perfect for all levels,5,"Great podcast for medical students, residents, attending's. Up-to-date information with a solid focus on core material. One of my favorite Emergency Medicine podcasts. Great team and keep you entertained while learning"

3114,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Brilliant,5,"An insightful, digestible synthesis of the changing face of medicine that will enhance your clinical care."
3115,FOAMcast -  Emergency Medicine Core Content,Great for doctors and non-doctors alike,5,"With their tight dialogue, the hosts manage to convey a lot of information clearly, with spaced repetition. They don't waste your time with non-scripted chit-chat, but they do slip in a few good jokes in each episode, and their ribbing of each other makes listening fun and well as informative."
3116,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,Short and to the point.,5,Just like the name sake.
3117,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,Totally Depressing,2,"I have listened to this podcast for at least 3 years. More and more, it features talks that are related to climate change, sometimes directly and sometimes not. While I am totally convinced that man has a definite part in what is happening to our climate, his gloom and doom finally got to me. This podcast was deleted from my feed and I will no longer be listening to it."
3118,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,More than just sound-bites,5,"I have been listening to Ockham's Razor for three years now, and I am thankful for the broad range of topics that this program explores. The 10+ minute format allows a range of very passionate people to dive into topics that invite contemplation. I find myself discussing with my friends and colleagues what I learn on this show -- a sign of good radio show/podcast."
3119,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,Episode 4 : Prof. Aiken,2,"What a load of bunk. The man opens with the admission that he is not a scientist, and that he is not trained to evaluate claims of global climate change, then goes on to demonstrate that his admission was grossly over-esimating his abilities. Ignoring or ignorant of the preponderance of evidence, I was disturbed to realize that a PodCast that categorizes itself under ""science & medicine"" gave airtime to such an ignorant political idealogue. At this rate I expect to hear Ben Stein on Evolution, Dick Cheney on Morality, or President Akhmadinadjad on Liberalism.
People should accept that the uninformed opinion is of little worth, but is often shouted the loudest. This podcast certainly gives them a rooftop to shout from.
I will continue to listen, as some podcasts have a rough start, and may reevaluate in the future.
Please make room for people who ARE experts on the topics that they espouse."
3120,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,Not What I Expected,3,"I was expecting interviews with Scientist, but it appears that this is just a platform for individuals to read their opinions. This is fine but I prefer more of an interview than a speech."
3121,Ockham's Razor - Program podcast,Insightful and Thought Provoking,5,"Ockham's Razor covers a wide range of fascinating topics and obtains world-renowned experts to discuss those topics. The topics are also presented in a manner that the average layperson is included in the conversation. More programs, please!"
3122,The New York Academy of Sciences,Great... But please improve production,3,"Please, improve production of podcast."
3123,The New York Academy of Sciences,Great find for the Science Inclined,5,"And to think I didn't know that much about milk, having spent so much time consuming it.... Great program when you want to listen to something with some storyline and flow, not your more commonly found ""lecture."" Friendly."
3124,The New York Academy of Sciences,One of the best podcasts on iTunes,5,I have literally downloaded almost 200 episodes. This is the best educational podcast I've ever listened to.
3125,The New York Academy of Sciences,Neat podcast,3,"The host goes out in New York City and reports on interesting research or scientific goings-on. ""Reporting"" style."
3126,The New York Academy of Sciences,Almost (but not quite) Phenomenal,4,"I stumbled upon this podcast by chance, and I was so suprised at the quality of the content. They've interviewed some really high-profile guests about very intriguing topics. However, I was really disappointed at the shabby sound quality. In the Oliver Sacks episode, you can hear sirens and traffic in the background. In others, there are often noisy distractions and fuzzy interference. I hope the creators work out these kinks a little bit, as this show could easily compete with other big science podcasts, like NPR's Science Friday. I'd also like to hear the interviewer interact with the guest a little more. She seems somewhat passive and sometimes lets the guest wander from the topic. Let's hear a dialogue, not a one-way chat with some ""uh-huhs"" thrown in! Good podcast, but it has the potential to be phenomenal."
3127,The New York Academy of Sciences,Generally Brilliant Speakers,5,"You don't have to live in NYC to get a wonderful chance to experience NYAS, and I am so grateful for that."
3128,The New York Academy of Sciences,"brain tickling ideas, but sometimes.....",4,"individual panel speakers sometimes sound a lot esoteric and ingrown. strange that the academy introduces a lot of different ideas, while at the same time the thinkers seem to not get out a lot. its a good thing there is a variety of speakers, it would be silly otherwise. who wants to hear an hour of conversation about the exquisite wing flap of the death beetle? (didn't happen, but the speakers seem like that.) sometimes the annoyance of listening leads me to click delete."
3129,The New York Academy of Sciences,smart stuff,5,"this is a science podcast that's accessible, smart, and surprising. its lively, thought-provoking interviews and science-cultural discussions make NYC seem like the center of the science universe. who knew?"
3130,The New York Academy of Sciences,Great minds discuss mindbending issues.,5,"This is a first rate podcast with top level interviewers and guests. The Bob Park lecture is highly recommended, containing a coherent arguement against creationism."
3131,The New York Academy of Sciences,Great podcast great lectures,5,Great podcast great lectures
3132,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,Amazingly informative,5,Love it.

3137,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,Soooo good!,5,"This show is so interesting, I am completely hooked. Great job!!"
3138,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,The Naked Scientist,5,"This show is fun, interesting and full of questions everyone wonders about but don't know who to ask or where to look. Love all the shows and can't wait for each of them to come out! Sandra M. Surprise, Arizona"
3139,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,so far so good....,5,"I often laugh when I hear some practical answers from the speakers.. I always complicate things, It just need a simple answer. I learn a lot from this podcast... Good Job! you should update this more often."
3140,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,great show,5,Well produced and engaging podcast. One of the most accessible science themed shows out there.
3141,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,Great Stuff!!!,5,This podcast is wonderful! A gold mine of information at your eartips.
3142,Ask the Naked Scientists Podcast,Why Do Ducks Fly in 'V's?,5,"This fantastic podcast is a fast, informative call-in show giving scientific answers to questions that burn within us. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to both doctors who alternate episodes answering questions from inquisitive Brits. Two thumbs up."
3143,Emerging Infectious Diseases,Not very engaging,2,"The host talks like a second grade teacher, boring. I prefer TWIV"
3144,Emerging Infectious Diseases,I just love it.,4,I love the precision and clarity of this podcast. It's no nonsense and SUPER nerdy. Awesome.
3145,Emerging Infectious Diseases,Lecture,2,"Epidemiology is an exciting subject, so it's a shame that this podcast is essentially someone reading papers. Not unbearable, but not the thoughtful, engaging approach this fascinating area of science deserves."
3146,Emerging Infectious Diseases,Disappointing,2,I whole-heartedly agree with the other reviews for this podcast. It is too scripted and the guest are obviously just reading from a written script. It would be much better if the host and the guest had more of a conversation about the subjects discussed.
3147,Emerging Infectious Diseases,Scripted & boring!,1,"I thought the topics would make this podcast fascinating, but it's 2 terrible actors having a fake, scripted conversation about diseases. You may as well download one episode and give it a listen to see what I mean. Boring!!!"
3148,Emerging Infectious Diseases,Too static,2,"I have just started listening to the first few episodes and they are almost not endurable. The first episode appears to be someone reading a paper with all numbers and methods etc. in a fashion that was not even good in the 50s. The second episode at least has a guest but you can tell that both are just reading from a prepared script. I then randomly skipped forward and the later episodes at least seem to have some ""live"" guests that actually respond and not just read from their notes. Very disappointed so far."
3149,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,ED MD,5,Good stuff! Well made and pertinent to ED practice.
3150,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,"welcome back, you were missed",5,"i love your podcast, very helpful, i am a new attending (usa) and am a father of two beautiful kids, so i know first hand how precious time is. i am glad you have set aside some of yours to make more episodes of this podcast to help your fellow EPs. be well. i appreciate what you do."
3151,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,4th Yr,5,"Short, succinct, outstanding! A excellent review of ER pertinent anatomy and procedural- related anatomy."
3152,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Incredibly helpful,5,"As a Hospitalist/Internal Medicine doctor in practice >13 years, I learn a few thing watching each episode that I eventually bring to the bedside. Terrific!"
3153,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Great anatomy review!,5,"I'm an ER resident and I'm finding that my anatomy knowledge is lacking, so I've been trying to review Netter and correlate disease processes which has been difficult. I love FOAMed and podcasts so when I came across this review I was thrilled. I've only watched the C spine lecture but loved it and can't wait to watch more. Keep up the great work!"
3154,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Thanks!,5,"Thank you for your wonderful, illustrated, well paced and succinct presentations :)"
3155,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,"Great review, lots of fun",5,"Great mix of zebras with bread and butter EM. Great review of anatomy. Openly admits a mistake and constantly requests feedback. It's clear he has worked hard to create a great product. I am really glad I found this podcast even if I'm a little late to the party.
Fun review of clinically relevant anatomy for medical students, and important review of anatomy for the clinician."
3156,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Well done!,5,"Andy's Anatomy for ER primers are well-informed, concise, and accessible. I appreciate the time that he's put into creating this great resource."
3157,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Awesome!,5,You are doing an amazing job with these episodes. Look forward to more and thanks again! Sharing these with all my friends and fellow EM coworkers.
3158,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Fascinating & extremely practical,5,"Whether you have a passing interest in human anatomy or need a refresher, this podcast is exceptional. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Dr. Andy Neill provides great insights, diagrams and straight forward breakdowns of real-life cases. Though he brings medicine ""back to basics,"" it's by no means light on content or real-world EM cases. Even if you're not keen on the dirty details of ER cases, his lilting Irish brogue and expansive experience make it worth a listen. After all most are broken into digestible 6-8 minute video cases I like to read before work or winding down at the end of the week."
3159,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,MD,5,"Short and to the points, very good illustration graphic"
3160,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Keep them coming!,5,"Love this podcast. Nice review with great illustrations of relevant anatomy.
Thanks!"
3161,Anatomy For Emergency Medicine,Love It,5,"I'm an EM resident in the US and just stumbled upon this podcast last week and Love it: Short, sweet , to the point, and brings back the anatomical basis to understand EM Diseases. I also love the imaging teaching and reviews. Check it out (and Andy Please keep up the great work!)"

3173,MinuteEarth,Great Content!,5,Only wish a minutes was longer sometimes.
3174,MinuteEarth,Outstanding shorts,5,3 minutes of some of the most creative scientific ideas I have ever seen.
3175,MinuteEarth,Awesome but needs more structure,4,"This podcast is awesome and I would give it a full five stars if it was a little more structured with when they release each podcast. Other than that, keep up the good work, MinuteEarth!"
3176,MinuteEarth,"Thank you,teaching me",5,"Thank you for teaching me about the earth and the wonder things about life,This might sound a little bit crazy but you teach me more then teacher ever has,and Im 12! Well thank you for taking your time to read this minute earth.Keep making videos!"
3177,MinuteEarth,Information mostly correct,4,"I like the science in simple words the only fault was the ""400 parts in a million experiment"" did not provide information on OTHER sources of climate change. I think it was misleading."

3180,MinuteEarth,uggh,3,"This podcast seemed to have a lot of promise, until I saw the segment on ""global warming/climate change"". You folks never give up, do you? You've lost all credibility by pushing the fraudulent ""science"" of global warming. I'm not fond of science with a political agenda."
3181,MinuteEarth,Crazily Educative,5,This podcast is awesome. So much have learned from it.
3182,MinuteEarth,Awesome!,5,"Great, keep up the quality information!"

3184,The Life Scientific,Keeps Interest if you love learning WHY...,5,Gonna keep Listening!
3185,The Life Scientific,Great Content potentially the worst mixing of all time.,3,Why would one want to listen to something mixed like this? I‚Äôm listening in headphones and it sounds like people are talking behind me and in one ear at a time. Terrible. Wow.
3186,The Life Scientific,Helped me carry on,5,"This podcast, specifically the interview with Dr. Andrea Sella, helped keep me motivated to finish graduate school. Thank you."
3187,The Life Scientific,Candid conversations with scientists,5,"This is kind of a ""What makes them tick"" kind of conversational podcast. I think more people need to be more aware of the scientist who inform us in an almost invisible way because most people are not aware of the important work they do. Well, here is the place to find out who, how and why these people work to make the world a better places."
3188,The Life Scientific,All the interesting people are here.,5,I‚Äôm so happy I have access into the minds of people who I admire.
3189,The Life Scientific,I like it,4,"I used to eat very little sodium. The past year ive been eating a ketogenic diet and also fasting. My keto podcasts that i listen to i think all suggest increasing salt intake when eating keto. Do you have any thoughts about eating a ketogenic diet and salt recommendations?
Ive only heard this last episode and i liked listening to the conversation."
3190,The Life Scientific,Needs More Depth,4,"Not enough detail, but better than some other BBC Radio 4 shows."
3191,The Life Scientific,Mind opening,5,"I truly love this podcast and it has opened my mind and given me great insights into science that I'd never have without it. I'm a landscaper and the scientific world is one that I don't have the privilege of encountering often. I really appreciate the work done here and the questions asked as well as answers and perspectives received. I recommend this to uncommon listeners as much as possible, I think the uneducated sometimes have the most to gain from programs like this. I know I have learned so much from it and it has inspired me to go back to school and get educated."
3192,The Life Scientific,"Jim, you can do better.",3,I listen to this from time to time depending on the subject. But it is not that good.
3193,The Life Scientific,Absolutely brilliant,5,Interweaves scientists‚Äô research/career highlights with their personal stories and motivations in a thoroughly satisfying way. The interviewer is brilliant and brings an understated enthusiasm and warmth to the interactions. This podcast is beloved by graduate students worldwide!
3194,The Life Scientific,Stupendous,5,"Thoughtful and interesting. The host moves at a nice pace, touching on a wide enough variety of ideas to keep it interesting, while giving each topic enough time to convey a satisfactory understanding of his guest's message. Looking forward to hearing more."
3195,The Life Scientific,Excellent,5,"The interviewer is understated, and lets the scientists talk. Learn something with each new episode."
3196,The Life Scientific,Interviews with prominent scientists,5,These interviews are well-chosen and sensitively managed. I learn something new and often useful every time.

3198,The Permaculture Podcast,Great podcast,5,"As a Marriage and Family Therapy student I view people within the relational systems they are a part of. It is encouraging to hear from people who are focused on a systems perspective in different domains. I find a lot of encouragement from this podcast, it is one of my favorites.
Scott Is a great podcast host."
3199,The Permaculture Podcast,Top quality material,5,Fantastic interviews with fantastic guests. I love this podcast. I have learned so much from it. Thanks Scott.
3200,The Permaculture Podcast,Professional begging,2,Stop asking others to pay for you dental
3201,The Permaculture Podcast,"great content, good podcasting",5,"The thing I appreciate most about this podcast is that Scott's style brings out the interesting conversation from the guests. I didn't realize how good he is at first because it is a casual, personal conversation, but when I heard the same guest on another show, I noticed a big difference! Anyway, this is a good permaculture podcast, it remains one of my faves."
3202,The Permaculture Podcast,I really like this podcast! Very informative,5,This is a very informative podcast. I really appreciate the care put into it. Scott has interviewed pretty much all of the thought leaders in Permaculture.
3203,The Permaculture Podcast,Awesome Content,5,"I am a big fan of Scott Mann and this very informative and focused podcast. Scott‚Äôs belief in wholistic design and life comes across clearly in his well thought out recordings. Always looking forward to the next episode.

3204,The Permaculture Podcast,A Permaculture Thought Leader,5,"Scott Mann's podcast is one of the first I started listening to as I began my journey to learn about Permaculture, and it is the only one of many that I've continued to listen to over the years. The podcast is informative, but more so, is a vibrant dialogue with a wide range of people from a broad swath of communities and subject areas that all relate and contribute to the knowledge base of the Permaculture community. Scott has been making the podcast for 7 years now, and it shows, with great audio quality and editing in every show, as well as an approachable format to each show. I highly recommend giving it a listen, and if you are looking for a place to start, I would recommend 1523, Necessary Simplicity with Ethan Hughes. It's an inspiring discussion that I come back to again and again. Give this podcast a listen, and skill up for the coming age!"
3205,The Permaculture Podcast,"Take care of earth, yourself, and each other.",5,"That's Scott's sign-off and what he presents in each episode. If you want to keep up with what's going on in the world of permaculture, subscribe to this podcast. If you want intelligent discussion of real solutions for our most pressing problems, subscribe to this podcast. If you want to know if a better world is possible, subscribe to this podcast."
3206,The Permaculture Podcast,Thankful,5,"Scott Mann weaves a series of beautiful interviews in the epsisodes of The Permaculture Podcast as he tells the story of permaculture, agriculture and rural living, but more than these, the story of human connection as a life path. I came to the podcast looking for technical information, (having just bought an old farm in WNC), was not disapointed, but came away with inspiration."
3207,The Permaculture Podcast,I love this podcast,5,"I listen in every week, and am still going through all the old episodes. I‚Äôve learned so much about permaculture through Scott‚Äôs interviews with the pioneers. So cool that he‚Äôs not that far away from me too!"
3208,The Permaculture Podcast,Kelly Montana,5,"Any of these podcasts are informative, interesting, and such a joy to listen to the voice, and sense of Scott Mann directing great conversations. Please hear them all for a well rounded discussion on many levels."
3209,The Permaculture Podcast,Solid and sincere,5,"Just finished interviews with Adam Campell and was really moved. The shows are concise, with clear questions and answers and an authentic dialogue. If only the shows were as long as Dan Carlin's Hardcore History!"
3210,The Permaculture Podcast,Scott Mann is a terrific interviewer,5,"This is by far my favorite podcast. It is the only podcast about permaculture that I found listenable. Scott Mann is a wonderful host. I love hearing insights into his own lifestyle and way of living, child rearing, etc. though he doesn't reveal too much in any given show. He finds amazing people to discuss all fascists of permaculture with. This podcast has changed my outlook on the world and the direction I want to go in my life. Thank you Scott!"
3211,The Permaculture Podcast,Scott is the Mann,5,"Very good resource, especially for the price. Scott fosters some good conversations that spawn some great information."
3212,The Permaculture Podcast,Many Thought-Provoking interviews,5,Scott is a good-hearted dude who puts a TON of work into this podcast. Some of the interviews have literally changed my life‚Ä¶.
3213,The Permaculture Podcast,Best Permaculture Podcast,5,Professional and insightful. The absolute best permaculture podcast out there. Scott Mann is such a great host. I have listened to so many of these and will continue as long as it is in production. I like how Scott actually lets his guests talk and it's not all about him whereas Paul Wheaton tends to ramble on and get caught up in his ego.
3214,The Permaculture Podcast,Impressed,5,I have only heard 2 episodes but I am loving this stuff already
3215,The Permaculture Podcast,Good Content,4,Really important medium for the permaculture realm here. I admire Scott's persistence in acquiring the different voices of the movement.
3216,The Permaculture Podcast,Excellent podcast,5,"I've been enjoying Scott's podcast for a few weeks now, working my way through his archive. Each episode is a well researched and produced by someone with a real passion for the subject. Take a listen and you won't be disappointed!"
3217,The Permaculture Podcast,"Wow, what a great show!",5,"I have learned so much from listening to this show. It gets me extremely excited about learning to live productively and with nature! Scott is very smart and cool and asks very thoughtful questions. Careful, listen to this and you won't stop!"
3218,The Permaculture Podcast,A major body of work and a gift to all mankind.,5,"Scott Mann's radio show is immense in labor and educational value. We listen to his shows on our permaculture farm while working and cooking. Kudos to Scott for his podcast, thought-provoking questions, choice of guests and
Community mindset. In my opinion he and his guests are incredibly necessary if we wish the world to be a better place for us and future generations. Bravo! An excellent education awaits us! Kent Byron, Grace Note Farm, Petersham, MA"
3219,The Permaculture Podcast,Food revolution,5,If you are looking to broaden your understanding of food systems this is more than a resource. This podcast opens an entire new world of word and meaning to those who will listen
3220,The Permaculture Podcast,Excellent Show,5,"I have been listening to this podcast well over a year and this review is long overdue. Scott covers many different topics relating to permaculture and his passion for the subject can be heard in every episode, even the ""Permabytes."" When Scott says he is available he really is, I have had a handful of email conversations with him. This show has ""added fuel to the fire"" when it comes to my interest in permaculture and I can't wait to find my place in the movement.
Chad, Surprise Arizona"
3221,The Permaculture Podcast,Took a chance,5,"I found this podcast as I was looking for more foraging/herbalism podcasts. This podcast is not those but it does capture another lifestyle that is pretty compatable. Chocked full of great guests with useful information, some are even herbalists and foragers. Not was I was looking for but I'm glad I gave it a try because I've learned a lot from the permaculture PODcast."
3222,The Permaculture Podcast,Necessary.,5,"To say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great‚Äù, five stars, is an understatement. With a minimal production budget Scott has built a library of conversation aimed at tackling THE issues of our time. The podcast is self-aware an fearless in engaging with topics that most may deem lofty. We are at a point in history wherein our planet is demanding vision, and these conversations deliver seeds of ideas that may ultimately grow into the defining guidelines of our species future on this planet."
3223,The Permaculture Podcast,the first and the best,5,"It has earned its name as *the* permaculture podcast. Though there are now several others in the same field, this show remains the go-to.
Various permaculture techniques get the bulk of the discussion around the Internet, but Scott Mann and his guests get down to the deeper social and systems basis. If you want to hear another discussion of how to do hugelkultur or build with cob, there's plenty of other resources out there. But if you want to understand permaculture itself, or why it's so vitally important, this show is for you."
3224,The Permaculture Podcast,Fair and Enlightening,5,Very good dialogue and reviews.
3225,The Permaculture Podcast,informative and inspiring,5,"Scott Mann cares deeply about the fullest meaning of the permaculture ethic, and it shows. This informative podcast is carefully curated, covering a wide range of topics with thoughtul guests who have done their homework, as has Scott. Always worth listening to."
3226,The Permaculture Podcast,Necessary,5,This podcast is worth every moment. Excellent and inspiring conversations with little pretense. Exploring a new way of viewing the world.
3227,Radio Motherboard,No it is NOT good for you to Waste hours online! Pay attention to this world around you....,1,"Too many people obsessed with screens is causing our society more harm than good. As grandma said, everything in MODERATION..."
3228,Radio Motherboard,Grow up,2,"I listened to the first podcast on right to fix and it was great. I liked the flow of the show and thought hey I'll check this out. Well, the very next one sounded like a bunch of kids sitting around a dorm room on a liberal campus whining about Trump and dropping ""F"" bombs every other word. How about stepping out of your safe space and creating a non political show. Unsubscribing ...."
3229,Radio Motherboard,Production quality and zero editorial work hampers the show,2,"With some editing and polish, this could be solid. It's not, though: it's meandering, uncritical, and fuzzy. Like, it sounds fuzzy.
Instead of mediocre 44 minute shows, give us polished, tightly-edited 19-minute shows. I'd listen to those."
3230,Radio Motherboard,"Every other word is ""like""",1,"If you enjoy listening to hosts that uptalk (everythign sounds like a question), use vocal fry, say LIKE in between every other thought, and generally mumble... then this Podcast is for you!"
3231,Radio Motherboard,This podcast rulez,5,Motherboard publishes some of the best stories out there and Radio Motherboard is great because you get the same level of quality without having to read. I hate reading.
3232,Radio Motherboard,ISP provider,4,"Interesting topic... But the host is not well informed on the topics they discuss. Otherwise love Vice. ""I use to have the fastest speed available when I got it for free, now that I have to pay for it I subscribe to the cheapest and it's really slow"". Why do you and everyone else thing you should get everything for free?"
3233,Radio Motherboard,Bright future,4,Can be hit or miss depending on how much they have investigated the topic and the quality of interviews they get. Needs a serious upgrade as far as sound quality goes. The hosts are great when they have a topic they are passionate about. If they are serious about making it work the show can be great. Just need consistency when it comes to the content and better quality sound.
3234,Radio Motherboard,Terrible,1,See above.
3235,Radio Motherboard,great topics; terrible volume/sound levels!,3,"Like the previous reviewer, I‚Äôm rating your podcast as middling. That‚Äôs NOT because of the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the hosts, guests, or topics, but instead because most of the time you all sound as though you were recorded underwater, or in a closet, or maybe a closet underwater. Somewhere far away from the microphones, anyway. PLEASE BOOST YOUR SOUND LEVELS."
3236,Radio Motherboard,what is the purpose of this podcast?,2,"You know how companies who don‚Äôt need an app‚Ä¶ well they get an app and the app is half-hearted and terrible. Nobody cares about it. It‚Äôs not important.
That‚Äôs kinda what this podcast has going on.
I don‚Äôt think I have finished a single episode. How much poorly edited roundtable discussion by partially informed people who don‚Äôt have the will or the time to go into any interesting depth can we take? About 9 minutes on average for me.
This podcast exists so some upper management at Vice can say, ‚ÄúWe have 10 podcasts.‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe have podcasts for all our properties."""
3237,Radio Motherboard,"Love for the future of ""Motherboard..""",5,Honestly one of the best things to happen to this planet...Motherboard features new and inventive ideas that clashes with our planets cultures...Also to divulge into our future of Technology and etc...Thumbs up...Enjoy..!
3238,Radio Motherboard,I love Vice/Mobo,3,But I'm kind of baffled how Vice could allow something of such poor quality to be published under their banner. I'm not talking about the content (content is incredible) but sound quality is so bad that I can't listen to it while working in my shop. I really wish these guys were given the proper equipment and time to polish this podcast. Vice has really slacked in the podcast world and to finally find this and realize how poor the sound quality is was a big let down.
3239,Radio Motherboard,One of my favorite podcasts,5,This podcast picks awesome thought provoking topics to discuss and the hosts are very like-able. If you like technology they have a one of a kind podcast that you need to subscribe to.
3240,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Favorite anesthesia podcast,5,Love the short keyword episodes
3241,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Relax the voice,2,"Good Topics and Content.
‚ÄúKeys to the Cart‚Äù difficult to listen to. Podcast speakers sound stiff and non-fluent. It sounds like a non-medical person reading content off cue cards or out of a medical textbook."
3242,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,"Short, sweet, succint",5,"Thanks, Dr Ally B!! Appreciate your weekly podcast, good reviews that stick in my brain this time around:)"
3243,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Consistently excellent,5,Thoughtful and balanced--love it.
3244,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Excellent resource,5,Easily the best Anesthesia-focused podcast available. Covers all aspects of anesthesia from cardiac to general interest to OB.
3245,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Wonderful resource,5,I look forward every month to hearing a perspect from a recognized expert. Helps me to stay aprasied of new research.
3246,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,excellent resource,5,Very informative and easy to access. Great asset to those of us out of training who like to keep up with the current literature in a reasonably convenient manner.
3247,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,great idea,5,"Just listened to Dr Slinger's podcast.
Comprehensive review of important issues.
Thank you"
3248,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Jeff Wright,5,Up to date information from many of the academic leaders in our field. A great asset to all interested. Very well done.
3249,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,No a single minute wasted,5,"As a practioner years removed from residency, I find this series of podcast quite relevant. There are plenty of reviews, and plenty of up-to-date research discussions for a busy anesthesiologist. The guest speakers (experts and research authors) are articulate and direct and to the point. No time wasted on detailed divergents that do not fit into the 20 to 45 minutes spent on each topic, but still there are enough to interest me in finding out more info for myself. Excellent work and great value to the education of our field."
3250,OpenAnesthesia Multimedia,Listened to them all...,5,This is hands down the most informative anesthesia podcast on the web. The 2 week cycle of article review with the authors followed by an expert review of a certain area of anesthesia is a fantastic format. In addition Dr Nemergut has done an excellent job of formatting the interviews and discussions so that they are maximally informative. A must have for any provider of anesthesia care. In addition his work with the oa.org anesthesia wiki is very helpful and impressive.
3251,This Week in Parasitism,A fun part of every month,5,"I came to this podcast as a joke I played on a friend who had a nasty parasitic infection but stayed for the wit and wisdom. I have so much fun listening and studying, I hope you have as much fun making it as I do listening"
3252,This Week in Parasitism,Love these Guys!,5,Thank you for such a great podcast!
3253,This Week in Parasitism,Updated review: still one of the best.,5,"One of only 3 or 4 podcasts I listen to regularly. Their conversational style, fascinating topics, I feel as though I were back in medical school, hanging out with some of the cooler profs."
3254,This Week in Parasitism,Parasitus in Latin is a lesser guest...,5,"Get to know the creatures who share your body, and the bodies of animals and sometimes invertebrates. Broad based education with some clinical medicine, some basic science, and general musings by very experienced academics who are generously sharing their time. The entire enterprise is sincere and well-meaning."
3255,This Week in Parasitism,Truly awesome,5,"My second favorite science podcast. Gastropod is the first, Inquiring Minds was displaced by TWiP. You'll learn more in a few episodes than in a semester of college, if you don't freak out completely instead."
3256,This Week in Parasitism,These guys are great!,5,I really enjoy these! Can‚Äôt stop listening.
3257,This Week in Parasitism,Entertains and educates doctors!,5,"My MD husband listens with interest when I play these out loud on our car trips. As a doctor of the other sort I found this to be an excellent way to learn about parasites, then teach my students."
3258,This Week in Parasitism,A bit late to the party,5,"I‚Äôve only just found this amazing podcast. Please have more of Dr Despommier‚Äôs stories. I wish my professors were like you, I would have never skipped a single class."
3259,This Week in Parasitism,An excellent podcast,5,This is the most accessible of the TWiX family. I recommend it highly to everyone.
3260,This Week in Parasitism,SOS! Binge watching TWIP!,5,"TWIP! I love all the TWIM‚Äôs, TWIP‚Äôs and TWIV‚Äôs!! I am an avid listener and just discovered these gems a few months back. Thus I have binge listening to them for the past month! I listen to them almost daily! Being that I was just accepted to PA school, and my favorite class as an undergrad was Parasitology- I love this podcast! I listen to it routinely and it has helped me refresh my memory on what I learned in Parasitology. I love Dickson and Vincent and with the addition of Daniel or as they say TWIP 2.0. The podcast has just become even better! I love the real life medical cases that are presented, and help me use my critical thinking skills! The podcast has also made me careful of what I eat and have even given me nightmares of waking up with parasites- but good nightmares! I highly recommend this podcast to anyone who is interested in medicine or even just parasites! Magnificent podcast! Will continue listening. I have learned so much and you will too!"
3261,This Week in Parasitism,Excellent information and funny,5,I really enjoy listening to Drs. Racaniello and Despommier. They are able to make a complex subject easy to understand and fun to learn.
3262,This Week in Parasitism,Perfectly parasitic podcast,5,"This podcast is a great combination of research and banter. I really appreciate the hosts‚Äô ability to break down the disease processes from lifecycle to molecular level and bring it back again. It is a great listen for anyone at any level and if you don‚Äôt have the background, they will quickly bring you up to speed in through a conversation as a teaching tool. I highly suggest this podcast to any individual interested in the complexities of life on this planet."
3263,This Week in Parasitism,Love,5,"Start from the beginning, this makes it easy to follow and very educational. I love the way Vincent ask the questions Im thinking. And I love the way Dick explains and tells stories, He‚Äôs a very engaging educator. He has the cutest laugh and you just can‚Äôt help loving both these science guys when they interact! This spills over and you become lost in parasitism and science for over an hour. Love, Keep up the great work."
3264,This Week in Parasitism,Awesome group of podcasts,5,"I love TWiV, TWiM and TWiP. I really like that a group of scientists bothers to expose the public to how important science is in practical everyday life. This show will raise your awareness to the importance of science, issues related to science, the capabilities of science to solve real-world problems - you will understand the broadcast WITHOUT needing a scientific background."
3265,This Week in Parasitism,Twip Reminds Me of Click and Clack,5,"I discovered your site yesterday and am very excited with this deep vein of great knowledge that I can listen to while doing routine chores at my house. These podcasts remind me of Car Talk where I am entertained and educated by two engaging and intelligent experts. Your show explains parasitism in easy to understand terms and language. I would be very interested in hearing more shows about tick borne diseases. Instead of Click and Click, you could be known as the Twip Team of Tick and Rat!"
3266,This Week in Parasitism,Meh,3,"Really good information, buts takes way too long to find it. Ever considered making an outline, exploring a topic in a logically sequential manner, and staying on topic?"
3267,This Week in Parasitism,Revived,5,"After Daniel's addition, TWIP probably became the best of the TWIKs podcasts. Dick an Vincent are fantastic in debating parasites and their companions."
3268,This Week in Parasitism,10 out of 5,5,This podcast is great and everyone should listen to it every week.
3269,This Week in Parasitism,Story time and humor to supplement my studies,5,"I‚Äôm an MSPH student in Tropical Medicine and Parasitology at Tulane University. Listening to Dr. Despommier and Dr. Racaniello has been a real pleasure and a great way to unwind from the stress of everyday life while still reinforcing my learning. The fusion of basic biological science, public health, and education is a passion of mine; and I aspire to reach even half the caliber of the hosts of this show one day. Thank you for giving me a better course to my future."
3270,This Week in Parasitism,Edutainment at it's finest!,5,"This podcast is not only highly entertaining and educational it's also infectious! Ok bad pun but seriously you don't have to even have a college degree to enjoy this podcast! I learn so much from every episode and not always just facts on microbiology. I find myself laughing out loud while listening because the hosts have a great chemistry and good senses of humor. Even if you have no idea what parasitism is, it's worth a listen. You might love it like I did."
3271,This Week in Parasitism,"Great podcast, even for the non-physician",5,"I love the relaxed, conversational banter between the hosts. As a lay person, I especially appreciate the accessible way in which they present their fascinating subject matter and case studies. A truly exceptional podcast!"
3272,This Week in Parasitism,Spectacular and informative,5,I just discovered TWiP and am so excited to have a fun way to learn about parasites! My roommates frequently find me chuckling aloud to the sharp wit.
3273,This Week in Parasitism,Pinkiestile in Az,5,"I loved this pod as a duo, as a trio they are interesting,informative,challenging as well entertaining.I enjoy all the TWI casts"
3274,This Week in Parasitism,"Awesome for microbiologists, parasitolgists, and physicians alike",5,I love this podcast for my morning commute or to go along with my morning run. Fantastic case presentations and literature discussion.
3275,This Week in Parasitism,Fantastic,5,I love TWIP because I am learning so much. Thank you all!
3276,This Week in Parasitism,Great Podcast!,5,"Love it, love ALL of the TWIX family of podcasts. This one was already great, but got better when Daniel joined and they started doing a case every week. I have learned sooo much from this podcast, and its sister podcasts as well. They are informative, well-done, and I feel like I'm listening to a group of friends talking about science."
3277,This Week in Parasitism,I carry all the TWiX in my pocket,5,"Sharp, engaging, free-wheeling and unafraid to make the occasional erroneous statement - and to be corrected by listeners who write in faithfully. Even better with the addition of ""weekly"" clinical case studies. The best way I've found to soak up some pretty esoteric info in fields that can be as close to home or as exotic as science itself."
3278,This Week in Parasitism,Excellent show,5,Amazing show that keeps me entertained and educated every day!
3279,This Week in Parasitism,BA,5,You should do one for molecular biology
3280,This Week in Parasitism,Fantastic!,5,"I just discovered this podcast! It's a feast of knowledge...and I've got 8 years of podcasts to consume!! Thank you, Vince and Dickson, for building this treasury and making it available to the world. Hearing these makes me feel like I'm a kid sitting on the floor at ""Story Hour for Scientists"" in the the world's best library! What fun :-)"
3281,The Unofficial NCLEX¬Æ Prep Podcast by NRSNG,Finally,5,Something to play in the car and not waste any study time ever... because nursing school
3282,The Unofficial NCLEX¬Æ Prep Podcast by NRSNG,"NRSNG is exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered",5,"Thank you so much for creating these podcasts, your hard work is appreciated! The NRSNG program is a tremendous gift for all future nurses, it's exactly what the ""doctor"" ordered! I can't wait to see you on the other side and call you my colleague. ~ FUTURE RN"
3283,The Unofficial NCLEX¬Æ Prep Podcast by NRSNG,The best,5,I just love how they discuss real live nurse situation. Gives others a chance to have the perspective of being a nurse
3284,The Unofficial NCLEX¬Æ Prep Podcast by NRSNG,Great podcast,4,I love this podcast and the way that information is presented. The only reason why I am not giving it five stars is for the minutes and a half of music at the end of the podcast.
3285,The Unofficial NCLEX¬Æ Prep Podcast by NRSNG,Great podcast!,5,I'm so thankful for this podcast series! This will be so helpful to listen to throughout nursing school.
3286,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Cannot access lectures üòï,1,I‚Äôve downloaded the podcast but can‚Äôt access any 2008 lectures and all but one of 2009. What‚Äôs up? I am super eager to hear this stuff!!
3287,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Best Professor,5,"This was simply the best nursing prep class ever. And I have 2 and 1/2 Bachelors degrees so I have taken more than my share of courses. He is by far my top professor and I only took this one course with him online. Sadly I never met him in person.
He has a real passion for teaching and his standards were always realistic. I‚Äôm still teaching new nurses his stories. Thank you!! Also grateful for the podcast format!"
3288,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Family Physician,5,"I have been a family physician for over 25 years and have had wonderful and amazing teachers during my career. Dr Cizadlo ranks as one of the top 5. He has rekindled my love for pathophysiology and desire to relearn what I have forgotten and learn what is new, specially the NEJM and JAMA review articles. I have started incorporating more pathophysiology in my teachings and am telling all my medical students, residents and colleagues about this podcast. I am indebted to him and wish that I could thank him in person. For all those going into the medical field, this is a must podcast."
3289,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Bring it back!,5,It seems I can not listen to the tracks anymore. I love listening to these for meditation. His voice is so soothing and he explains things in such a visual way that I can picture exactly what he‚Äôs explaining. Plus he‚Äôs funny.
3290,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Highly recommend,5,Dr. C is hands down the best educator I‚Äôve ever listened to. I go to UCSF and his teaching wildly surpasses any of the professors I‚Äôve had. He makes concepts that can easily be taught in extremely confusing and hard to digest formats into the most straightforward and logical way. I reference this podcast for nearly every disease process I come in contact with. I am so grateful for this podcast and only wish he could teach a master class on education so more could learn his effective teaching style.
3291,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,I‚Äôve stumped my nursing instructors with these lectures.,5,I was bobbing and weaving and they couldn‚Äôt touch me. Highly recommended.
3292,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Awesome,5,Just wish I could get the older ones to download as well :)
3293,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Amazing resource!!!,5,"I never write reviews. This is my first one and WOW. I can‚Äôt even begin to express how grateful I am that this series of lectures exists and is available to the public. Yes, it‚Äôs a little hard to navigate and pick out the *one* you‚Äôre looking for but the material is on point, clear and thorough.
I am entering week 2/6 of an online summer pathophys class with only text and written ‚Äúlectures‚Äù and PowerPoint slides. I realized pretty quickly that, while I recognize the lingo and concepts that should be my A & P foundation, I‚Äôm a little (ok, a lot) rusty and nothing really replaces a good lecture, amirite?! Listening to these lectures has helped me grasp the new and recall what I do already know SO, SO MUCH. A big thank you to this professor for making these lectures available to students like me! Podcasts and YouTube, man. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without these resources.
*Also, only the most recent (2013) series of lectures are playable. This was kind of confusing at first since I thought I was ‚Äústarting at the beginning‚Äù but I guess the professor has recorded the same course‚Äôs lectures several times over many semesters. Just skip up to the lectures from 2013."
3294,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Amazing podcast for nursing student,5,I listened to this podcast on my commutes to and from nursing school. I rocked pathophysiology based on this alone.
3295,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,great revision,5,"that is a great lecturer i happen to find while searching for other information,
even though i went through these topics30 + years ago it is always nice to review in order to base your practice in solid science as opposed to clinical habitual practices .
thank you very much ,i wish the embryology podcast was still available."
3296,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Nursing Student,5,Wow this podcast is great!!! I am so thank full it is also free. Often when I read my text it is hard to understand all of the points. Dr Cizadlo is wounderful! It is nice to be able to listen to the talking points of each unit!
3297,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Great lecturer!,5,"Best educational postcast I've ever listened too. I was interested in learning about physiology, and found this. It was fascinating and fun! He's an entertaining lecturer and describes physiology so that we can picture what's going on."
3298,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Excellent!,5,"Excellent!!! I am in no way involved with the medical profession, but I find this podcast entertaining and fascinating. I hope it continues next semester!"
3299,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Phenomenal instructor!,5,I cannot say enough about Doc C's podcast lectures. I am neck deep in nursing textbooks that I have been grappling with reading and synthesizing . . . For which keeping awake and focused to digest has been an effort! Listening to Doc C has really been motivating and interesting. He presents complicated concepts with simple explanations and diagrams . . . Not 175 power point slides that essentially say nothing - rather 5-7 slides that intelligently synthesize the most pertinent and memorable information. Then he gathers it all together and helps you to imagine it for real in your mind and think about the practical applications of it. Brilliant! Thank you so much Doc C for making these incredibly valuable lectures available to the public for free!!!!
3300,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,I love it!,5,"His class is wonderful, very interesting. I am a nursing student and he makes everything so easy to understand. I listen at home, in my car, and when I go to sleep! Please keep it up!!! I am absolutely addicted now to the podcasts!"
3301,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Superb and honest* and funny**,5,"It's hard to imagine that I could describe these lectures as anything other than well-explained, well-said, intricately expanded and thoughtfully presented by a true expert, but I also find myself loving Dr. C's honesty* and earnestness in presenting these often difficult topics. He knows how students are and tries to get them to ask questions at the exact places they need to be asking questions. His funny** digressions and stories are also great. It's amazing.
I have been a pharmacist for 14 years and never before Dr. C's lectures did I _really_ understand body fluid mechanics or renal physiology. He often says, ""If you don't learn this now, you'll find yourself just reciting jargon and not having any idea what it really means. And I can attest to its being true. I thought I understood. Now I am actually understanding.
Among police officers, I hear they refer to some of themselves as ""real police"", the people who investigate and nose around and solve cases. Well, Dr. Cizadlo is one of the REAL TEACHERS."
3302,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Fantastic!,5,"I am a paramedic and I drive over an hour one way to work right now, and because of this podcast I actually look forward to the drive so I can listen without interruption!! Doctor C is truely a great teacher and not only explains patho so you understand it... he makes it enjoyable. I will be a long time listener!! Thanks Doctor C!!"
3303,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,WOW!!,5,"THIS PODCAST is amazing, thank you. I'm a sophomore in high school, really didn't understood the whole concept of the biological field to the point that I was taking the lowest biological level class. ""just hate it science overall"" one night I happened to be reaching for apps that could help me with my homework on proteins synthesis, although my teacher explain it over and over I just didn't get it. Science is a must have subject in order to graduate, so I was screw. Anyway found this podcast bc it seemed interesting, gave it a try on proteins lecture. I fully got the concept. Did my homework in no time, though wow what a extraordinary lecture and the guy talking it quite funny. Easy to picture. On and all, I'm still listening to this amazing podcast, its weird I found myself expending more time listening to this then on my ps3. On an update, I kept on listening to the lecture, within a week I got transfer to a honest biology, a week after everything clicked, I pretty bc i retain info so easily, not just trivia, but found logic behind all. My biology teacher recommend me for AP anatomy and all cell biology related subject. Thank you, you have change my view and understanding on this topic, made a 360 change in my academic knowledge. I really learning a lot and eager to learn more. Outstanding podcast :)"
3304,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Doc C is amazing,5,"As a nursing student, I listened to all of his podcasts before taking path and I rocked the class. He even wrote me back via email when I had a differential diagnosis question. He was, as expected, insightful and blunt. ""I like your thinking, but remember, as a student, you're not always playing with a full deck."""
3305,Biology 3020 -- Pathophysiology with Doc C,Only One Suggestion,5,"Really enjoying this podcast - I‚Äôm a nursing student, and they‚Äôre very helpful! My only suggestion would be a title for each episode. I just discovered it and have to shuffle through them to find one with content that is related to what we‚Äôre studying in class now."
3306,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Not smart,1,"I can‚Äôt believe how these guys are making light of COVID 19 you would be back to work seeing patients if it wasn‚Äôt for the government, making it sound like anyone wanting an N95 mask is hysterical almost..I get it in a way if you live in the country in a small town you may not understand the importance... your personal experience is limited"
3307,The Dental Hacks Podcast,The best dental podcast!,5,"Thank you Alan and Jason for introducing me to Dental Podcasts. I‚Äòve been a listener from day one and this podcast has led me to so many other dental podcast resources. While most other podcasts find a niche for their content, Dental Hacks creates a constant variety with clinically relevant content and entertainment in every episode. My new favorite segment is the Clinical Hacks! Love hearing from RADs about the ins and outs of fellow colleagues."
3308,The Dental Hacks Podcast,A great podcast,5,"I just started listening to Dental Hacks in the past few weeks and I really enjoy it. I usually listen to podcasts in the car while I‚Äôm driving and this is the perfect podcast to do that. The episodes are informative, interesting, and entertaining. I highly recommend listening."

3310,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Real People,5,"As someone who has been in dentistry for decades, I've seen a lot of people come and go in this industry. There are too many fake people, fake podcasts, and dangerous dentists spouting nonsense that do HARM to patients and other dental professionals.
But, Alan and Jason are different. They are authentic. They discuss their successes AND their failures. They are in it for the long haul. They've put their hearts and souls into creating a podcast that truly connects dental ideas AND people. Most importantly, they love putting out podcasts. Any listener can hear that in their voices.
They've also been kind enough to have me on their show a few times. I'm not a podcaster, but they've always been helpful and kind during the process.
Thanks to the Hacks and to Voices of Dentistry for being the voice for so many of us and for allowing people like me to have a voice."
3311,The Dental Hacks Podcast,All advertisements,2,Quality has dropped fellas I‚Äôm sorry :/ it‚Äôs all ads now and you can‚Äôt even follow the conversation because so many ads. I understand we‚Äôre all trying to make money but now the episodes have very little value.
3312,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Keepin‚Äô it real,5,"If you must commute, there is no better way to do it than in the company of the Dental Hacks. From the introduction to conclusion, I feel like I‚Äôm always learning, laughing and feeling a little less of a loner-failure in this dental life we live. Don‚Äôt extinguish the dumpster fire, rather step forward and embrace the warmth."

3316,The Dental Hacks Podcast,The best part of my day!,5,"The Dental Hacks Podcast is the best thing I have found to listen to in years. I listened to it every day as I drove to and from my fourth year of dental school. Now I listen to it as I walk to and from work. It keeps my brain thinking about all the things that I can do better as I interact with patients, staff, and every day Joe schmoes. I have learned a ton from Alan, Jason, and the amazing brain trust! A great find indeed!"
3317,The Dental Hacks Podcast,The Adam Carolla of Dental Nerds,5,"I am long overdue to write a review for the Dental Hacks. I've been listening since the start of my 3rd year of dental school when the episodes were still in the single digits. Alan and Jason helped me keep things in perspective while trying to get through clinic, and now they help keep me updated on what's new and motivate me to never stop evolving is a dentist. I listen to a lot of podcasts, but there are only two that I won't miss an episode of, the Adam Carolla Show and Dental Hacks. Thanks for all you guys do!"
3318,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Real Talk,5,"My favorite thing about the Hacks podcast is that is has built a community around not only giving fantastic information, but also being a great place to connect with other dentists about the real life of dentistry. I love the podcast and I also love going into the Facebook group and being able to continue the conversation with other docs. Alan and Jason have built something truly amazing!!!"
3319,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Great Dental Podcast!!,5,"I am a current DS2 trying to learn as much about dentistry as possible.

3321,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Gold Standard!,5,Kings of dental podcasts! The format has been mastered and they keep it fresh and interesting. Good hosts. Good content. Good everything.
3322,The Dental Hacks Podcast,My morning and evening MUST,5,"I started listening only recently but I‚Äôm obsessed and hooked! I am a recent graduate and wish I listened to this podcast while in dental school - the wealth of knowledge the wonderful braintrust has is priceless. I love the field of dentistry but listening to these episodes makes me so ecstatic to be a dentist each day. I started off trying to listen from episode 1 and was on episode 14 (I will still try to listen to them all and eventually catch up). I felt like I would be missing out on current topics so I started out of order today and listened to the most recent one ‚Äúfirst breathe through your nose‚Äù which I‚Äôm so glad I did! In our final months in Dental School our amazing ortho professor gave an awesome lecture on assessing tonsil size scoring and tongue classification to assess for possible signs of sleep apnea. I have been so interested in this and have a feeling every dentist will have to start screening for this just as how important it is for us to do head and neck exams. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the doctors and speakers that have been on the podcast, for sharing their information, and for helping us help more patients. My heart is always full knowing there are such great people in the world. Stay awesome. And thank you again in different languages: cam √¥Ãân, gracias, mercie, grazie, arigato. Sorry for such a long review I had to cut myself short...but I could keep going on! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõüíöüíôüíú"
3323,The Dental Hacks Podcast,The Epic Podcast of Dentistry,5,"Just finished a 3.5 hour drive to one of the many external rotations during my last year of dental school. The Dental Hacks Podcast has made my stanky roadtrips between ext rotations and commuting back home during weekends entertaining and, more importantly, educational. I especially love the Brain Trust episodes which is more chocolicious than a Christmas morning yulelog. Thanks for the many laughs and keep up the epic content!"
3324,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Chocolicious!,5,"Alan and Jason rock! This podcast is very entertaining, packed with useful content, and down to earth. Always interesting topics and great guests. It's like hanging out with friends."

3326,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Cosmic,5,"My childhood heros Bert and Ernie have anthropomorphized into Alan and JLips and each week I cloister a cluster of my dental friends and listen to the figgy pudding of dental podcasting, The Dental Hacks. Five BIG FAT Stars."
3327,The Dental Hacks Podcast,"Longtime listener, first time reviewer",5,"I never write anyone reviews, which I guess is ironic since I constantly ask patients to review my office everyday!
I love this podcast. It has been a part of my daily commute to work for a long time. I have integrated many of the tips I hear during the show into my practice.
This show is informative, but more importantly it‚Äôs entertaining! Alan and Jason have great banter back and forth, and are really easy to connect with as fellow dentists working in the trenches everyday.
Keep up the great work!
Dr. Chris Spillers"
3328,The Dental Hacks Podcast,My go-to dental podcast,4,"Writing this review is bittersweet for me. It's great content and the hosts, Alan and Jason, are both informative yet very entertaining. I'm more than happy to recommend this podcast to other dentists and dental professionals. The bittersweet part is that after 2 months of playing catchup listening to old episodes in order, I'm now only a month behind the real-time broadcast. Pretty soon I'll have to start waiting a week for each new episode like everyone else. Boo!! Awesome job guys; keep up the great work. I'm a specialist and even though this podcast is targeted towards the GP demographic, I still learn a lot. Thanks for all you do.
Update: still like the podcast but hearing about Voices of Dentistry over and over is getting a bit old."
3329,The Dental Hacks Podcast,An Inspiration and entertaining,5,"I found out about the Dental Hacks after it‚Äôs been in for awhile. I instantly started back at the beginning to hear them all! Being in the laboratory side of the dental industry, Dental Hacks gives me a great insight into the clinical side while being both informative and entertaining. I can always count on Alan and Jason to make me laugh at one point every episode.
On a side note: I ran a marathon yesterday and listened to Dental Hacks the whole time. It made the 4 hours seem like 3 and a half. :)"
3330,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Spear and kinder interview,5,My first podcast with the Dental hacks. Thoroughly enjoyed and entertained by the show. Content and tips were excellent. Great chemistry between. Jason and Alan. Will have to go back now and listen to the other 194 podcasts.
3331,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Not just for Dentists,5,I‚Äôm a 20 year dental assistant and I cannot begin to describe how engaging and informative this podcast is! Dr. Mead and Dr. Lipscomb speak my language and are amazing communicators. Invite your Staff to listen and broaden their knowledge base you won‚Äôt regret it!!! Absolutely LOVE you guys and so thankful to have you out there in audio land.
3332,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Awesome hackers,5,Not related to anything illegal. But dental hacks gives one of the best interviews and conversations in dentistry ever. Tune in whenever they have a new show. You‚Äôll be entertained! Dr kou in texas.
3333,The Dental Hacks Podcast,These guys are the best!,5,"These guys are the best! After a hard day in dentistry, they make me smile every time! The content is amazing - very current, very relevant, and what a great variety. I've been listening for years. Sorry about the slow review! Eventually it's my dream to meet these heroes! It's been fun to see them become so successful."
3334,The Dental Hacks Podcast,The best of the best with honors.,5,One of the best dental podcasts out there. A good mixture of humor and learning !
3335,The Dental Hacks Podcast,Best Dental Podcast,5,Great banter and valuable interviews with the top speakers in dentistry on topics that plague the average dentist. Keep up the great work guys!
3336,The Short Coat Podcast,Love this podcast!,5,This is such a great podcast! I recommend this to my pre-med friends all the time. I always look forward to its release each week. Great hosting and interesting student perspectives on a variety of topics!
3337,The Short Coat Podcast,Medical Humor and Advice,5,Love this show!! Dave and Co. always put a smile on my face with the bad jokes and nonsense (both medically-related and not). But this is wonderfully balanced with thoughtful conversation involving medicine and insightful advice.
3338,The Short Coat Podcast,Stuff,5,I related to Dr Mrachek and his story! I practiced cardiovascular surgery and dealt with similar stories! His moved me to tears and I presently am also trying to help our youth !!
3339,The Short Coat Podcast,Refreshing!,5,"I love the mix of humor, light scientific discussions, and unique student perspectives. The host does a wonderful job provoking conversation from his guests and is fun without being over-the-top. I listened as a pre-med and love it even more as a med student. Also, politics and medicine are inseparable, please don‚Äôt let the other reviewer deter you from having conversations about things that impact your future career and patients. Thanks guys!"
3340,The Short Coat Podcast,Loved!!!,5,The microagression episode! And the game has me laughing so hard!
3341,The Short Coat Podcast,Get to know the nurses,5,"It‚Äôs important for physicians to treat nurses with respect. I‚Äôm glad there are people talking about this issue, especially at the med student level."
3342,The Short Coat Podcast,Delightful,5,"Just a genuinely enjoyable show. Dave and all co-hosts are so down to earth and it's easy to see that they're truly passionate about what they do. They inspire me to work hard and one day I will see myself in medicine, too!"

As someone who is about to start their journey to med school this podcast has been a great source of encouragement and has boosted my confidence in my decision. Thank you Short Coats!"
3344,The Short Coat Podcast,"Fun, usually informative, occasional unilateral identity politics",4,"Mostly enjoyable content with wide variety. Formal interviews, candid discussion and hilarious games. Hosts usually stick to medical school topics but sometimes dive into pseudo-related political issues without any conservative perspectives to spark productive civil discourse. If you really enjoy politically progressive positive feedback loops you‚Äôll absolutely love these segments of the show. Regardless, I listen every week."
3345,The Short Coat Podcast,Not just for Med Students,4,I‚Äôm not a med student. Or even a student. But there is still a lot of interesting conversation and ideas about the practice of medicine that I find really relevant to all people!
3346,The Short Coat Podcast,Interesting,4,I am not a Med student but I am the teacher of many students who are entering or have entered the medical field. I find this podcast interesting and informative. I plan so share a few episodes with particular students on topics related to medical paths they are looking to enter. Especially the episode where you answer the question about routines during first year and about the document of positives/negatives during Med school.
3347,The Short Coat Podcast,Engaging & fun!,5,I love listening to your podcasts on my runs while I train for my marathon. People probably think I‚Äôm nuts as they drive/walk by because I‚Äôm literally smiling and laughing aloud at your jokes and dynamic witty banter. Thanks for making my long runs bearable!
3348,The Short Coat Podcast,Wonderful Podcast,5,Been listening for a few years now and find every podcast wonderful from all the topic areas you all bring up within the field of medicine. Keep up the good work!
3349,The Short Coat Podcast,Short coat is great!,5,"I find this podcast validating, since the journey to medical school seems challenging to me. These people have helped me to relax and realize that many other premeds are in the same place as I am. This podcast is also funny and inspiring. Keep up the great work!"
3350,The Short Coat Podcast,Interested in medicine? Why haven't you subscribed already?,5,"Dave and his knowledgeable and relatable crew of medical students will make your week! As a pre-health student, this hilarious and informative podcast motivates me to keep pursuing this medical education journey. I learn something new with every episode.

3351,The Short Coat Podcast,Informational and Fun at the same time!,5,"This is a good way to get an eye into what it looks like to be a medical student in all facets: curriculum, methods for success, how to stay sane, ethical situations in the news, etc. They give good advice in a nonjudgmental manner!"
3352,The Short Coat Podcast,Great Podcast,5,This is a wonderful podcast for medical students and pre-meds alike!
3353,The Short Coat Podcast,Pretty Neat,5,"‚ÄúThere is more pleasure in giving than in receiving‚Äù They say this pertains to both medicine.... and advice. I say why not enjoy both? I had the pleasure of receiving the advice of the podcast every week for several months before I started at Carver. And then I got the pleasure to join the flip side and be on the podcast a couple of weeks ago. Listen to this podcast for some advice, current medical news and a lot of good laughs! It‚Äôs all been pretty neat."
3354,The Short Coat Podcast,Must listen,5,"This podcast is always a highlight in my day. The perfect, light hearted mix of informative and fun. May or may not get weird stares when getting caught laughing out loud while listening at the gym."
3355,The Short Coat Podcast,"Witty, Fun, Informative, and Authentic!",5,"I have been listening to this podcast for two years, and every week these amazing podcasters remind me of the beauty and humanity of medicine! It is real, and the hosts are not afraid to speak their views and truths on tough topics, which I love! Not only do they discuss hard topics, but they do it with the right amount of humor (in a way that leaves you laughing as you drive down the road or smiling while you jog that last long lap). They are inspiring, and I can‚Äôt thank them enough for all the amazing advice they give. Keep being awesome Short Coats!"
3356,The Short Coat Podcast,"5-Star Host, 5-Star Podcast",5,"I‚Äôm an ICU nurse who needed something light to listen to on my bike rides to work. Although this isn‚Äôt the most informative medical podcast out there, it‚Äôs funny, lighthearted with a loveable host that‚Äôs incredibly easy to listen to. This podcast is definitely a mood booster. Keep up the good work!"
3357,The Short Coat Podcast,Would Definitely Recommend!,5,"I find myself refreshing my podcast app every Thursday to listen to the new episode. I love the mix of serious topics, listener questions, and fun games that Dave and the Short Coats present! Would definitely recommend to anyone considering going into medicine!"
3358,The Short Coat Podcast,Wonderful Resource!,5,"While I am in the process of changing careers, taking my pre-med courses, and assuring medical school is right for me, the Short Coat Podcast has been my go to resource for information gathering, understanding what life might be like medical student, and staying up to date on recent events in health care!

3361,The Short Coat Podcast,Clear perspective on Premed struggles,5,"As a non traditional student, learning as much about med schools as possible was a priority for me; this was a useful show for picking up info on topics I was totally ignorant of."
3362,The Short Coat Podcast,A blessing for any premed and medical students,5,It's such a breath of fresh air to hear about medical school and residency in a transparent light
3363,The Short Coat Podcast,Literally the best,5,"I found this podcast just a few short months ago and it has for real changed my life. My work commute is better, I have an even bigger appreciation for physicians and medical students and the effort they go through to better our health and the healthcare system, and I have learned so many new and interesting health related things because of this podcast. I‚Äôve always dreamed of being a physician but was on the fence if I had what it took to go through all the school and training. This podcast not only is a great guide for anyone looking to pursue medicine but also a great motivator for those, like me, who were scared or nervous they weren‚Äôt good enough. Thank you short coats and Dave for the phenomenal podcast!"
3364,The Short Coat Podcast,Insightful and entertaining,5,"I‚Äôm a new listener to this podcast but so far, it‚Äôs great. I really appreciate the hosts giving listeners the inside scoop of medschool. Plus, it‚Äôs hilarious too. :-)"
3365,The Short Coat Podcast,Good show,5,"Fun to listen to, engaging conversations (with political bias), and if you write in, you are very likely to get on the show."
3366,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Great podcasts,5,Mark stands as the most influential dentist of our time. His work ethic honesty and positive energy is a gift to the profession

3372,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Stop splitting episodes,2,There is no reason to break up an hour long interview into two episodes. I listen to plenty of other podcasts that manage over an hour on one episode. I can only imagine this is more work for whoever edits the episodes as well as myself for having to spin up another episode.
3373,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Very informative,5,This podcast has taught me so much! Episode 570 was amazing! Great job üëèüèºüôåüèº

Teaches you so much stuff that you don‚Äôt learn from school. Honestly.. it is a must listen to. I have heard a lot of others and was not impressed, with the exception of Gary Takacs who also has a great podcast. Anyways, this is as good as it gets for dental business knowledge."
3380,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Informative and Down-to-Earth,5,"This podcast is incredible.

There is a great mix of topics and a perfect balance of information and inspiration. Can't get enough!"
3381,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Listened to 4 shows my 1st day!,5,Great podcast. I've never been to a conference or heard a lecture before and came across this podcast that totally related to everything I'm starting to do in my own career 5 years out. Every show has a bunch of tips you can incorporate into your daily practice. I haven't listened to all the shows but in looking at the titles I haven't seen anything that relates to dental anesthesia and how it can change your practice.

I definitly would love to hear what you have to say about the topic and am willing to offer any knowledge I may have gained over the years....keep up the good work.
3382,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Drilling sound :/,5,Great podcast but that drilling sound hurts my ears. It shrieks an makes me cringe every time. Please change the intro. It does help wake me up on the road trips but could also cause me to jerk the wheel.

3384,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Thank you Dr. Costes,5,"I love the show and there is great content full of practical advice. I have listened to every one on my commute to work and often save the episode to write down some helpful hints or things to implement when I get into the office. Some great examples of other practices and exposing their strengths and weaknesses makes me think about my own practice, what to improve, how to implement the systems to improve, and use factual data to track the improvements."

After discovering Dr Mark and his podcast I spent the next 3 months listening to all of his episodes at least once, most of them multiple times. I might as well give up my Sirius XM subscriptions!
The free content that he delivers on such a consistent basis is fantastic. He has an incredible team and has the biggest names in our profession weekly.

3386,"The Dentalpreneur Podcast w/ Dr. Mark Costes - Become More Profitable, Less Stressed and More Fulfilled in Your Dental Career",Disappointing,1,"As with some dental podcasts, the interviews or discussions are completely self-promotional. There really is no meat- just commentary about how great the interviewee is and why you should invest in them. I understand not giving your secrets away but I don‚Äôt want to spend my time listening to why I should sign up for more summits and trips to courses that will take me away from my office. Basically an ad for whoever is being interviewed."

We have to study outdated information to pass our tests and study current literature to be prepared for rotations and eventually a job. I appreciate being able to listen to Core EM in my car during all of my drive time. I am also happy to hear on the 100th anniversary podcast that Core EM will try to include more content from PAs, NPs, and RNs.

I searched for Marriage Help during a time where I was losing hope in my marriage after my Limerent husband told me out of nowhere ‚Äúwe‚Äôre never getting back together‚Äù.
I just got done emailing my client advisor and told him that on the really tough days, listening to Dr Joe calms me down and restores my faith! It truly has already made a difference in my emotional stability and strength just from those two things alone. As soon as my budget would allow, I‚Äôll invest in the online course, and hopefully work my way to the workshop with my husband! I have so much faith in what both can do for me and my marriage!
Thank you so much üôèüèª

3421,Marriage Radio: Helping Your Marriage,Best advice for heart wrenching situations!! üòä,5,"This radio show was and will continue to be an essential part of healing from an affair or other terribly heartbreaking situations that can happen in marriages. Joe's genuine concern, compassion, honesty and angle on almost any difficult situation in marriage can really get a person on their way to healing, even before an affair might be done. The sincerity and topics can really give you renewed strength (with prayer too of course) and the different perspective that you, the standing spouse might need on a bad day or any day really during the restoration process can really give you a look at your situation with fresh eyes!
I downloaded all of the shows on my phone because over the holidays I went to see my family (12-14 hours away) and listened to the shows all the way there and back! I was never bored and got that boost that I needed to endure what comes next. üòä It was my first holiday without my husband, and I had my moments, but they were just that... Moments! I truly just enjoyed the time with my family and those I love dearly! I didn't obsess over what he was doing bc I prayed with my soul untilI got the peace that I needed, a peace that can only come from him! There was lots of silliness, giggles, and making fun! It was a great holiday! Shout out to Kim and Logan for their episode on the power of prayer! üòä I've believed in its power for some time, but that episode was great! Everyone else that was on there too was great! Alice, Terry, etc! Everyone is invaluable and so very important! You are all doing incredible things and saving so many families with the heart you pour into everything at Marriage helper! You've met your calling and I know God is up in heaven, proud as can be that you are His! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï

I really enjoyed listening to the pod casts and have learned many things about myself and my husband. I try to take notes during the pod casts to try to put into practice. I know we have a long way to go but this amazing program helps in more way than one. I like the fact that the staff has first hand experience in these real life situations and not just text book knowledge. The honesty and personal experience is comforting to hear from other couples that validates your own feelings. There is hope in putting back the pieces of your marriage one piece at a time. The pod cast with Joe and Alice is extraordinary, to be able to actually hear both sides speak about something so deeply personal in order to help others is blessing that carries on.

3434,Marriage Radio: Helping Your Marriage,This is the best hope I've found for my marriage,5,"Joe, Kimberley and the team at Marriage Helper already have a company that provides products based on years of experience, proven methods, research and science. That would be good enough. But the thing that really opened my eyes and that Joe and Kimberly and the team at Marriage Helper have that set them apart is they have *been there.* Educated and talented they may be, Joe experienced divorce back in 1984 but he and his wife overcame their difficulties and have been married since 1987, he's also a recovering addict and understands firsthand how that affects marriages. Kimberly shares her own difficulties openly in a few podcasts, and has applied these methods herself. Now she coaches and helps others based on things she herself experienced combined with her research, education and training. Other counselors and employees at Marriage Helper have also had seemingly hopeless marriage circumstances, but have succeeded in applying these methods to transform their marriage. What does this have to do with the podcast specifically? The Marriage Helper modality and experience is described in detail in all of these FREE podcasts! I've purchased one of their products but I still will download these and listen in my commute and they have been life changing. If you want to improve your marriage this is a good podcast, but if your marriage is in crisis *do not* pass this up!"

I‚Äôm 4 months into my contract at Stanford and have used so much of the information you‚Äôve provided while working in the float pool there.
You two have definitely sparked an interest in emergency medicine in me! Thank you!
Would you consider doing a podcast on code team dynamics and ACLD protocols? I used to be a designated code recorder before I became a travel nurse and would love your expertise on roles/responsibilities. Also, a discussion on Hs and Ts with examples from your work experience... I think... would make a dynamite podcast.

3476,The Purrrcast,Trying hard to love this,4,"I adore cats, I adore Steven, that Sara chick, not so much. I want to LOVE this podcast and it‚Äôs almost the case but I find Sara so incredibly annoying. She constantly bursts into an annoying laugh at any given moment without any real reason. She puts me to sleep then it‚Äôs giggle giggle giggle, and I‚Äôve got to turn it off. I know I‚Äôm in the minority but I also think most people are listening for Steven. Just my opinion, but I can‚Äôt get through an episode listening yo a grown woman act like an immature child"
