0,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"This podcast is by far the best podcast out there. First of all it's free. Second of all, most of them run for almost three hours. And if the listener is very visual, Joe Rogan has all of his podcasts episodes on youtube to watch... in their entirety!
Let's just get something clear. People are made up of opinions, and experiences. Joe Rogan is a person with opinions and life experiences as well. Having said that, when one goes into listening to this podcast, as a listener, one benefits much more when he/she listens to the content with an open mind. And that... is what the purpose of this podcast is meant to do. Absolutely fascinating and POWERFUL !
"
1,The Joe Rogan Experience,1,"I've learned more from this show than I ever learned in school. The longform conversational interview allows the guests space to form full ideas and teach everyone something. Then sometimes they just get high and talk about insect videos, and how they're glad insects aren't the size of cows. I think one of the best things about the podcast is how varied the guests are. A regular listener like myself is exposed to all kinds of new ideas, information, and points of interest. On top of the fact that the tone of the show is very much a ""get out there and do something"" tone. I've made large advances in my character and ability to think about things in an objective way. I wish I had found this show when I was about 16.
"
2,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"Joe is hilarious which provides great comedic relief when he has his more serious guests on. I listen to this podcast everyday, and I am never disappointed. Joe and Redban put so much material out there...each podcast is usually around three hours. As for the guests, the spectrum is wide; anywhere from professional MMA fighters to comedians to astrophysicists...all extremely well read. My favorite guests are his guests that have to do with psychedelics and other entheogens. Definitely worth a listen if you are somewhat insightful or just like to laugh at funny stuff. Keep it up Joe!
"
3,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"Im surprised at the quality of guests, and quantity of podcast its almost hard to keep up with. The content is entertaining and often makes you want to be part of the conversation. JRE is an alternate media source. He brings a lot of stories not in the news to our attention and i would especially recomend it to people that dont know a lot about joe rogan or think they know a lot about him. Hes open minded and very modest he quickly changes any opinions most people have of him. Ive gotten many co workers and friends into it and i urge everyone to give it a fair chance.
"
4,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"The most entertaining pod cast i have ever listened to. This is how ""Talk Radio"" is done! Duncan is a great addition to the show... when he is there..  Joe enters every conversation topic without a biased opinion and looks for REAL facts in everything, which every human being should do.  This dude is truly trying to help people's lives, and it shows.  I'm looking for Henry Rollins as a special guest on the Joe Rogan Experience. What a great conversation that would be! 
"
5,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"The JRE is by far the best podcast there is. Great guests with awesome conversations. They make you feel like your sitting at the table listening as one of the guys. The show can be serious or gut busting funny. My favorite guests range from Graham Hancock, Duncan Trussell, Joey (CoCo) Diaz, Shane Smith, Les Stroud, Redban, Bryan Callen and Steve Rinella. And recently i moved an episode into my top 10 of all time with Michael A. Wood #670. Just to name a few. I'd like to Thank Joe and all his guests for all the years of Knowledge and entertainment. Keep it real guys!
"
6,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"Joe does solid interviews, seems genuinely curious, and tends to stay out of his own way.
The staying out of his own way is most important to me: I used to love the guests in the tim ferriss podcast, then I realized I was just listening to Tim talk about himself for about 2/3 of the show. Joe just seems to want to find things out, and push people on their ideas, but flips the ratio around of letting the show be more about the guest than about him (Joe).
"
7,The Joe Rogan Experience,5,"Joe rogan experience is so good, he talks about everything under the sun.  He is never short an interesting guests from comics, doctors, actors, MMA fights, authors ect. They are long and interesting watch as hours disappear because of interesting and lively banter.
"
8,The Daily,5,"I have never written a review before but just listened to the most recent episode about the systemic problems at the UNC childrens hospital. It makes me appreciate how important excellent independent investigative journalism is for keeping our society (and specifically the most vulnerable children) safe. As a parent, a patient and a primary care doctor I cannot thank the times enough for putting the resources and excellent journalists they have behind this story. Additionally, this episode was so incredibly well done and added so much richness and understanding to the print -- it literally brought me to tears. Thank you all SO much for the work you do. Ellen
"
9,The Daily,5,"I feel like I've been floundering in this world where we really have too much information. Where do I focus? What's the real story, not the punditry? For me, this short podcast gets straight to the point with the information I actually need, not the junk that normally fills up the 24-hour news cycle. Thanks Michael Barbaro and NYT for such a wonderful podcast!
I'll add, if you're looking for the right cocktail of podcasts for your political news and analysis, I'm completely satisfied with the duo of The Daily and Pod Save America. Great combo!
"
10,The Daily,5,"This podcast with Michael Barbaro is excellent. The interviews are timely and compelling; he really gets at the heart of the issue and at the heart of the person being interviewed. It makes the listener feel as though they have not only gained insight to the topic but also to the opinions of the person being interviewed. I love this show! Michael's personality comes across in every episode. I can't wait to listen every morning on my way to work; it makes my journey enjoyable and at the end, I feel better informed. Keep it going!
"
11,The Daily,5,"The Daily is my ""go to"" source for more in-depth coverage/analysis of the issues of the current news cycle. Sometimes that means covering the latest breaking story as in ""Robert Mueller’s Testimony"" (July 25). Other times, The Daily presents an alternative to the story heard everywhere else. When it seem every news outlet is covering the most liberal (and vocal) members of the House, The Daily covers a moderate member and the issues she is working on for her constituents (""The Freshmen: Mikie Sherrill"", Aug. 12). Want to know more about a particular story? The expanded episode description includes background reading.
"
12,The Daily,5,"... along with a few minutes of bullet point style news at the end. It's an excellent format that provides both the ""what happened"" and the ""what that means"", i.e. news and means to interpret. Very nice program - really worth it in today's age of news in 160 characters.
"
13,The Daily,5,"I can't always listen to the interviews but I would love to read them!
"
14,The Daily,5,"This is the first podcast I listen to daily. Great in depth, unbiased look at the top political stories of the day. I would highly recommend this podcast.
"
15,The Daily,5,"Best podcast I listen to throughout my day. Have not missed an episode since it started.
"
16,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"This podcast is brilliant. Both Karen and Georgia keep me laughing and entertained. They are quick, witty, and make you feel like you are hanging out with a couple of friends. I love it! There are some reviews that are (IMO) harsh on their level of research. I don't think that's fair considering they are really upfront to listeners that the show is primarily for entertainment value. Also, regarding any poo pooing on them ""peddling"" things: unless you want to pay for your podcasts, the show does need funding somehow.
Thanks ladies for putting on my favorite podcast! You are totally rocking it.
"
17,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,1,"This is easily one of my fave podcasts! I love the girls' sense of humour, true crime, and comedy--so it all meshes very well for me. I know some people think the girls aren't as sensitive as they need to be, but I personally have no issues with them, and think that when they do do something that is over the line for them, they always address it and try to learn from it. I think they do a good job at trying to learn and do better, while also having a hilarious podcast. A++ Plus, I love the Murderino community that has popped up surrounding their podcast! Such a great group of folks. <3
"
18,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"I love this show. Its a fabulous True Crime Podcast, but also bear in mind that its a comedy podcast. Ignore the negativity. I feel like Karen and Georgia do an excellent job of talking about some really fascinating, albeit difficult, topics, with both respect to the victims of the crimes, and while diffusing the situations with light humor. I'm the first one to turn off a True Crime Podcast if I feel its disrespectful, this one isn't. I started listening a few weeks ago, and I'm binging. I feel like I'm sitting with 2 great friends, on Georgia's couch, petting Elvis and having a great conversation. If you tried one episode, and you weren't in love, PLEASE give it another go. Stay sexy, and DON'T GET MURDERED!
"
19,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"The first time, I had a hard time getting through the first episode. But I decided to give it another go with a more current episode and felt like I found my people. I listen to a variety of true crime podcasts, but this is one of only two that I found combines humor with enthusiasm for true crime. Karen and Georgia manage to broach some delicate subjects with sincerity -- much of which is manifested through the community by way of support for one another and good causes like helping plow through the backlog of rapekits across the US. Karen and Georgia are not murder snobs. They are like two people you wish you knew in person.
"
20,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"If you're more into somber/humorless stories about murder, this podcast won't be your cup of tea. They do take some time at the beginning of each episode to chat and joke, do some ""housekeeping"" and updates, and I think it's a great way to kick off talking about horrifying true crime stories. Those who just want to get to the ""good stuff"" might be kind of frustrated. They have a very wry, dark, sometimes TMI sense of humor, which I love. They do joke throughout the murder stories too, and they try to end each episode with positive/lighthearted stuff. Perfect for people who love true crime and have a morbid curiosity, but also appreciate humor peppered in to keep the nightmares away.
"
21,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"Don't expect perfectly researched crimes or a polished presentation - you won't get either. What you will find is a super entertaining hour hosted by two very funny, completely relatable women. I'm an ex public defender with a life-long interest in crime, but my favorite part of the show if what happens before the crime talk. Karen and Georgia's pre-crime banter is hilarious. They are genuine and original and have amazing chemistry. The show is so honest and personal and I feel like we're friends. I look forward to listening every week.
"
22,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"I recommend this show to almost everyone because it is the most brilliant post-modern meta-critique of expertise, gender politics, civic duty, and criminal justice that I have ever come across. It is a master class in Millennial culture--audience participation; nostalgia for pop-culture kitsch; detached cynicism for society's horrors punctuated by genuine emotion for simple acts of humanity; and above all, a brutally honest dialogue about mental health. Start at the beginning and stick with it for a few episodes. By episode 8, you'll be laughing out loud.
"
23,My Favorite Murder with Karen Kilgari...,5,"So many podcasts that don't have huge production budgets have two hosts talking to each other and it is painful to listen to. THIS podcast is so well done it seems Karen and Georgia are amazing professionals that have been doing this for years and years or every word is scripted in advance, because it ALL WORKS! Don't know how they are so much fun, but I have this podcast on all the time. Bummed I didn't know it existed before they did a live show in my city. Luckily I've only listened to 30 episodes so I have plenty more backlog to hear before I have to wait for a new episode to drop. Great job!!!! You guys make this look easy (and we know it isn't!)
"
24,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"Michael--I agree with you that this is the very best thing you could do with the next year (instead of making a movie). News changes so fast! And so do newsfeeds. I will follow this of course--one suggestion I have is to get not only get famous people in the mainstream like Mr. DeNiro--but also the most popular liberal youtube channels--like TYT, Kyle Kulinsi, Sam Seder etc. Many of these great liberal voices are in New York so it shouldnt be too difficult! We must win over the depressed electorate and fight for the world that we will create. Soldiers never died to defend demagogue dictator wannabes! -A lifelong fan from Portland OR
"
25,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"A deep bow of gratitude to Michael for never giving up in troubled times, and for not letting us give up either. His underlying message of empowerment and proactive engagement of, for, and by we the people may just keep me sane over this next election cycle. Not only does he gently (yes, gently: I find his pod-voice comforting) lay out what must be done, but builds the case for how and why, as if he were coaching us on our civic responsibility. For instance, it felt like he was our eyes, heart, and mind in the House during the Impeachment debate and vote beyond what we watched on C-SPAN. Thank you, Michael Moore.
"
26,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"Michael. I am a senior living in Toronto, born in Windsor, ON. I have been binge listening to your podcast and it is amazing. What I take away the most is how grateful that I am to be a Canadian. My three siblings have recently had major health concerns, including my youngest sister being in intensive care for three weeks with a brain aneurysm. The only expense would have been parking, but the fabulous hospital is on the subway line. How the US continues to be in the dark ages when it comes to health care, while having the greatest education facilities, the leading edge science and more continues to baffle us all.
Keep up the great work. You are doing so well and I am a podcast aficionado!!
"
27,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"our present system we have to deal with...YOU JUST CAN'T FIX STUPID. And that goes for bs president and associates
"
28,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"WE are the ones we have been waiting for Michael, and YOU pod it out there for a terrific reminder. Together we are better; in a harmonious chorus that shouts across the land - integrity UP! Love, EARTH.
"
29,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"These are wonderful and thoughtful conversations! I really enjoy this show!
"
30,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"Great conversations! Thought provoking conversations and insight! Michael is great!!
"
31,RUMBLE with MICHAEL MOORE,5,"This show has come at a time when we really need to hear from Michael Moore and others. Thank you so much, Mr Moore!
"
32,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"Rachel, you are my hero.You have a personality like non other. Your show has gotten me me through the worst of times which started with Trump's election, a political tsunami that is reaching the shores of the small prairie outpost where I live in the Great White North that is Canada. Eh Rachel! I love your show, I admire your intelligence, your respect for the truth. You are a master storytelling, weaving a tapestry of meaning from the facts of political life as it unfolds before us.I am mesmerized. You give me hope. You have awakened in me the sleeping giant of affirmative action. The world is a better place because you are in it. Please run for president.
"
33,The Rachel Maddow Show,1,"I must admit I attempt to avoid watching TRM show in order to listen to the daily podcast.  For the past several years I multi task by listening to the podcast while jogging.  TRM show can be counted on to deliver full scope reporting, exposing flaws of narrow messaging, misleading commentary,  and non credible sources. I truly enjoy her call out of PoltiFact, it is hilarious listening to the volume increase of her voice when dispelling yet another failure of their statements. I encourage my friends to join the podcast hoping they will appreciate the deep dive of facts presented on current political affairs.   
"
34,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"Rachel always has the facts down cold. She never asks the viewer to take her word for anything. Everything piece of information is attributed to a credible source and she always tells the story in narrative form, so that the story actually plays out as a story. She is relentlessly cheerful and polite, even when telling stories about hypocrisy, corruption or even oppression of minorities. Rachel Maddow makes sure that ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" is actually never about Rachel Maddow.  So it turns out that the smartest person on TV is also authentically humble.  Read ""Drift,"" by Rachel Maddow. 
"
35,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"Enjoy watching/listening to a broadcast that is researched, documented, thoughtful and doesn't assume anything but gives the viewer/listener points to consider, leaving much room to reach personal conclusions. It's nice to hear Miss Maddow speak in complete sentences, using more than a third grade level vocabulary, not talking down, up or sideways to her audience. I very much appreciate all supporting documentation presented for each story. Interviews are conducted respectfully with thoughtful questions. There's much news from many source -- I enjoy getting many points of view -- Miss Maddow's broadcast is certainly in my top ten.
"
36,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"I have been a long time fan of this show and when I got rid of cable I thought I would have to go without. So I was excited to find this show on Stitcher a few months later. Rachel covers mainstream news with a liberal slant of course but what really makes the show shine is the in depth coverage of events you don't see anywhere else. I especially like how she builds on in depth topics throughout the week so you really get the full story rather than a 2 minute tidbit. Also the gusts she brings on are definitely knowledgeable and don't always necessarily agree with her brand of liberalism which makes for good discussions. This is by far my favorite new source and I highly recommend The Rachel Maddow Show to everyone.  
"
37,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"My family and I have listened and followed Rachel Maddow since she was on Air America. We were quite excited when MSNBC, after having her on as a informed guest, and then stellar guest host, gave Rachel for her very own show! To say we learn something new Everyday! from this program is an understatement. TRMS has remained as fresh, informative, current and as reliable as ever. Kudos to Rachel and the entire the team that makes it all work, it seems, so effortlessly. Keep up the great work. Thank you Stitcher for your app and availing us full episodes of TRMS .
"
38,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"Rachel is one of the Greatest News Story Tellers in the history of journalism. Her unique style in delivering the news in an articulate, factual, compassionate, and interesting way, sets her way apart from, and above, her contemporary fellow journalists. There is no one in the news business is in the same category as Rachel she is simply amazing and I love to listen to her every weeknight on Stitcher Radio. I don't always agree with her perspective on some subjects, but I respect the fact that she always tries to corroborate her news facts when delivering her news stories. Keep on Rock-It Rachel you magnificent Story Telling Journalist! Intelligence is sexy, Rachel is beautiful, and there is a whole lot of sexiness go on with Rachel! Thank You
"
39,The Rachel Maddow Show,5,"I almost never watch Rachel on TV but make it a habit to at least listen to her show intro (the first five minutes) on Stitcher every day. She is great at connecting disparate facts, often historical, and bringing them to bear on a current issue. Almost all of the time it is not a problem not having video although on occasion she will show something and not explain it.  
Once she gets to the ""guest who always agrees with me"" second segment though I tend to move on to other shows. When she has a great topic or is really on fire I'll listen to the entire show on Stitcher. Always time well spent.
"
40,True Crime Garage,4,"I like this show because they take interesting cases and Nic does some serious research and is very well versed. If I have one complaint, it is that the Captain seems like the bored kid in the back of the classroom that often involves themselves in conversation only to crack a joke or go off task. I mean, he sometimes makes decent point, but rarely. And sometimes the attempt at levity are not appropriate. However, Nic is so good, he offsets this and redirects the conversation. I mean, if you have something to inject that is relevant, but if you just want to speak because you are tired of listening, well, good for you, but nobody else.
"
41,True Crime Garage,2,"I've been listening to the boys for a long time now. And, my personal pet peeves aside (incorrect grammar is the biggy...Nic ;) ) , they put out a good show. I find it amusing to read all the ""Dump the Cap'n!"" reviews, cuz I adore the Captain. And Nic ain't so bad...and none of that personality difference matters anyway. Point being, if either of them got ""dumped"", this show wouldn't work. It takes both, and it gives people the unending choice to choose a preference between them, which people seem to need more than air. I'm here because the Captain usually says what I am thinking, and the guys do their research. Keep it up, gentlemen
"
42,True Crime Garage,4,"This is absolutely my favorite true crime podcast available! The guys do a great job covering the facts and sharing their own thoughts and opinions while remaining conscious and compassionate to the victims and their families. Something that is sometimes lost on other podcasts of this kind. When I first started listening I thought the mixes with the news clips at the beginning of each show were a lil hokey but now I actually really look forward to seeing how they will introduce an episode musically every week. I'm actually finding myself now being caught up on episodes wanting to go back and re-listen to the older ones again, so bravo!
"
43,True Crime Garage,4,"This podcast appeals to a broad audience because it takes serious crime cases and dissects them in a way that the everyone can understand. The story telling model - two guys sitting in their garage drinking beer and discussing true crime is very refreshing. If your feelings get hurt easily or strict political correctness is your game - you may have to listen to more than one episode before you get what these guys are doing, and keep your opinion to yourself until you do so. Nic is a master storyteller and The Captain balances out the story with thoughtful insights as well as keeping one hand on the brake in case the Nic train gets going to fast. Definitely one of the best podcast out there for true crime or otherwise.
"
44,True Crime Garage,5,"This could be an excellent podcast were it not for ""The Captain"". The case choices are interesting, the research is pretty top notch, the sound quality is great, and Nic is a consummate professional. BUT, I always find myself gritting my teeth to get through the episodes because of ""The Captain's"" inane, misinformed, misdirected, and generally garbled input. He spews an unceasing stream of ""jokes"" that fall totally flat, and spends the bulk of each podcast nitpicking and arguing with Nic, almost always with no purpose or point, just to be maddeningly contrary. Were it just Nic alone, or with almost any other second speaker, this show would be great. As it is, It's like listening to an adult discuss true crime with a cranky, drunk, nine year old.
"
45,True Crime Garage,5,"For the most part this is well-researched and calmly presented information, but the Captain has the diction and vocabulary of a 15-year-old C student. He's just a chore to listen to. He claims to be the sound guy and editor, so why doesn't he edit out the times when it takes him 6 or 7 tries (sometimes with aggravated grumbling) to get out a sentence? Nic would be better served playing the interested everyman against someone who passed high school biology and can string 9 words together without gargling them at the back of the throat.
"
46,True Crime Garage,2,"After having been through most of their catalogue now I'd have to say that Nic and the Captain have great rapport and do seem to go very detailed into each case - more than most podcasts. I especially enjoy the multi-part episodes where they do deep dives.
However, they don't seem to be the brightest dudes in the world and sometimes speak in utter gibberish, use the wrong terminology or make baseless generalisations which can make you distrust their commentary. I find that any case that is related to wider social issues is usually a write-off because of their lack of understanding.
In short: two bros drink beers and chat about murders. If that's your thing you'll dig it, but don't expect anything deeper.
"
47,True Crime Garage,2,"Nic and The Captain are hosts I could be friends with. I love the tone of this show. Two down-to-earth guys sharing fascinating true crime cases in a well laid-out format. They present the facts, include interviews and media clips, provide insightful theories and speculate on possibilities. Always interesting! Nic and The Captain's styles compliment each other well and balance out the serious nature of the topics. The Captain's quick, subtle wit and the host interaction sets this show apart from the hundreds of true crime podcasts out there. They keep it fresh and keep me coming back for more.
"
48,This American Life,5,"I have been a regular listener (and contributor) for ten years or so.  It is one of the finest media creations of any kind, and really the only narrative artform that has matched the quality of the best of the current Golden Age of serial television.  The thematic topics are consistently surprising (very hard to accomplish that); the stories themselves run the gamut from hilarious to heartbreaking (sometimes in the same story), and the production values are superb:  sound editing, music and the exquisite use of silence.   I often find myself wondering, ""How does this program continue to be this excellent when so much of the culture lurches towards mediocrity.   It actually  makes me think differently (and more positively) about this American Life I am part of.  
"
49,This American Life,5,"This American Life is EPIC. Get involved. Ira Glass is an incredible host, reporter and storyteller. Every week the show highlights a different aspect of American society with a unique and thoughtful eye. This show has made me laugh, cry, think, tell all my friends about it and I look forward to hearing this podcast every weekend on my long runs. In fact, I once had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Glass (extremely nice/goofy guy) and I told him that it was between him and Beyonce for my favorite running partner.
"
50,This American Life,5,"This show is always hard to explain to people who've never heard it before. I usually say it's about just what the title says: American Life. Beyond that I explain that there are very diverse topics tied together by a theme for the week. If you've never listened before give it about three tries. Some shows are better than others (or just more interesting to me), but I've never gone more than three weeks without finding something really interesting. 
"
51,This American Life,5,"This American Life is never a disappointment. TAL is the reason I listen to all the other PODCASTS! A new twist on reporting, and topics seldom covered with such indepth. The humor is very tastefull. Wiretap, Risk, Radiolab, The Moth, Third Coast Int, and of course This American Wife, can all say thank you to Ira Glass and his crew for sucking another listener over to the other side. ;o)
"
52,This American Life,5,"If you have never listen to This American Life. You are surely missing out on one of the best radio programs on today. Its like having an award-winning documentary broadcasted to your phone. The in depth reporting on stories that you can't or won't hear anywhere else is amazing and refreshing in our sound byte driven media landscape today. Enough can't be said about this program. Enjoy! 
"
53,This American Life,5,"This American Life is a fantastic program. The stories they tell each week are wildly engaging and truly remarkable, the cadence and flow of the show are perfectly timed, and Ira Glass is the best host you could ask for. I don't think you have to be an NPR fiend to love this show; I think you just have to have a curious and active mind. Five stars for making me think, smile, and grow.
"
54,This American Life,5,"The stories told on TAL are compelling and entertaining. Some stories make you really think or see a new perspective, others may make you laugh out loud or tear up a bit. Ira is always great and most if the storytellers are extremely interesting. David Sedaris often makes a guest appearance and the show does fun and creative things like broadcast live I to movie theaters. I encourage you to check it out and it may become your new favorite show. 
"
55,This American Life,5,"TAL is one of my all-time favorite things about public radio and one of the reasons I support my local NPR affiliate. I love the insight you get from hearing stories from other peoples lives that makes you realize how similar (or dissimilar!) our own lives are to other Americans. Stitcher is the best way I've found to listen to TAL and to discover new programs like it. 
"
56,Dateline NBC,5,"With KEITH it is, as if, he KNOWS what he's talking about, as if he has walked these dark quiet lanes, dug these shallow graves, pushed the body crumpled and bloody as it was behind the boiler, seen the moon, low and pale in the sky that quiet and freezing night. It's as if, somehow - maybe perhaps, just maybe, HE was there. Maybe he knows a lot more than he is letting - on. Is KEITH MORRISON A KILLER ???
"
57,Dateline NBC,5,"I have loved Dateline since I used to watch it when I was a little girl with my parents.
"
58,Dateline NBC,5,"I accidentally discovered this podcast and I love it! The host presents the cases in a well informed and compassionate manner and has a lovely voice!
"
59,Dateline NBC,5,"This is the best podcast ever made. I love true crime but I hate listening to endless commentary. I just want to listen to the story and form my own opinions and this does just that. Excellent all around.
"
60,Dateline NBC,5,"Keith Morrison is the greatest storyteller of our time.
"
61,Dateline NBC,4,"Unfortunately, some crimes happen enough, that the whole story is just so predictable & depressing. Keith Morrison Episodes are 5 stars though, always.
"
62,Dateline NBC,5,"I am a true crime ADDICT and this is the only true crime podcast I will now listen to. So much more interesting to listen to than all the others, most likely because Keith Morrison is so much fun to listen to. Such a great voice, great narration & great story-telling. Love Dateline!!
"
63,Stuff You Should Know,4,"Great show! I never miss this one. They always pick interesting topics and deliver the content in an easy to follow manner. The back and forth between the hosts actually makes it easier to listen to the episodes and stay interested. Decent production value - they try to insert enough variety in the delivery that makes it easy to stay tuned in. I'm rarely just sitting there listening to the show, so good production makes it easy to listen.
The interaction between the hosts feels natural and actually keeps you included in the show. Occasionally, they get a little silly, but overall it's well done. Add this to your playlist!
"
64,Stuff You Should Know,1,"I absolutely LOVE listening to this show. I usually am not a fan of talk radio or podcasts. Being a listener of music, I usually want to skip straight over the talk, but when a friend told me about the Sticher app, I had to look into it. Really the only show I listen to on this app is Stuff You Should Know. As a teacher, I use it in my 6th grade classroom (or just impress my students with my wide range of knowledge on whatever topic we are discussing for the day). The show is highly entertaining while still being informative--a tough combo to create at times. Josh and Chuck...Bravo, guys! The show is superb!
"
65,Stuff You Should Know,4,"I did realize how much I enjoyed the chemistry between Chuck and Josh until I got sucked in on the April Fool joke. Honestly I was on the treadmill and was ready to pull the plug on SYSK. Glad I didn't or I would have missed all the great shows that followed. A subtle version of Abbot and Costello's whose on first. I even liked the Cohen, Cohen, Cohen and Cohen routine in the Burlesque show. The classic ending of throwing a rock and talking to the person it hit was right on the mark. Subtle and smart to those who are paying attention. Effortless learning!
"
66,Stuff You Should Know,5,"Love the shows, for the most part. As someone who lost both parents recently and had to compile their obits, I could relate to the Obituaries podcast. But one thing bothered me. They kept pronouncing ""Linotype"" incorrectly. The Linotype machine is a machine formerly used by typesetters to set a line of type. Hence the name: Line O' Type. They kept saying Linn O Type, which is wrong. My father, who was a printer, would be spinning in his urn if he heard Linn O Type. Also, I wish they would stay on topic and not divert into tangents that take away from the topic at hand. But I keep listening!
"
67,Stuff You Should Know,5,"I used to love this podcast, but I've noticed the show goes into political points of view and strays from topics more and more lately. I keep coming back to try to find an episode I can enjoy and find it's difficult to listen to an entire podcast. My suggestion to SYSK is to pick interesting topics and provide more information on said topic as opposed to sharing your political views and bias. I get enough of that outside of podcasts and there are other shows dedicated to that sort of thing. I can't say for certain, but it may help your ratings which appear to be consistently declining on Stitcher.
"
68,Stuff You Should Know,4,"These guys are entertaining and are generally pretty informative. That said, the shows are generally based on an article from the website that was written by someone else and some of the details are wrong. I don't know if the fact checking issue is with them or the articles but there are definitely factual errors on a regular basis. So, enjoy the banter and the general explanations but double check any amazing facts before sharing them with friends.
"
69,Stuff You Should Know,2,"Stuff You Should Know is one of my top 3 favorite shows because of Josh and Chuck.  They are funny, intelligent and their shows are very well researched and there's always an interesting angle/ twist to their shows.  I listen to all their shows and the one about savings was particularly outstanding.  I had my boyfriend listen to the show on Ways to Save Money and immediately afterwards he did inventory of his spendings and was able to get his cell phone company to cut his monthly bill from $100 to $50!  Thanks for the amazing show and great ideas!
"
70,Stuff You Should Know,3,"A long, long time ago, when this show was born, Josh and Chuck used to do a wonderful job learning their stuff. I remember a very early episode on the sun starting out something like, ""Wow... we did a ton of research for this to prep... we're going to get a few things wrong, but very excited about this episode...""
These days it's become very opinionated. I stopped listening the day I heard Chuck begin, ""Sorry if we're low energy. They have us record these back to back... so I think this is our 3rd episode today...""
The passion is gone. Topics are explained on a superficial basis without much research. If you actually enjoy learning, this show no longer scratches the itch.
"
71,Pardon My Take,5,"Great Interviews. If you get it you get it. If you don't it will confuse you.
"
72,Pardon My Take,5,"This is the most elite podcast of all time.......................
"
73,Pardon My Take,5,"Like Joe Flacco, there are many questions about whether this podcast is elite or not. Big Cat and PFT always come through in crunch time but never seem to do so in the regular season? But really this is really funny and the Segments are great. I do not wash my apples
"
74,Pardon My Take,5,"This podcast is as elite as Joe Flacco. You can hear the take quakes across the country, even when the bachelor is on, which I'm not watching...
"
75,Pardon My Take,5,"I'd be a real shame to rate this podcast so highly without any compensation, so I will not.
"
76,Pardon My Take,5,"All my jokes come from this show. I haven't had an original thought in the past 2 years.
"
77,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"Glenn is a true patriot who inspires me to learn more about the founders intent. As a 22 year military veteran, my heart swells with pride knowing that there are Americans such as Glenn that want to ensure that our government be accountable to the people and to do what is right for the nation and not their own interests. Glenn has opened the eyes of so many people to learn more about our government to ensure our freedoms are maintained. I met Glenn several years ago during his Rally for America and was impressed with him taking the time to thank me for my service which I could tell was sincere. He is a great American that is threatening the status quo to ensure liberty prevails.
"
78,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"I'm a conservative Christian. I agree with most of what Beck says, but I really hate being ""Noah'd"". Beck sometimes goes on too long about things. That said, What I really love and enjoy about the show the most is the dynamic between Glenn, Pat and Stu. I love that Pat and Stu tease Glenn and call him out when he starts gettin' crazy. That Stu gets so irritated with Beck sometimes and Beck just keeps poking and Prodding is pretty great. Pat's got does some really great impressions. It's really fun to listen to and makes my hour and half drive home from work not seem so long. You guys seem like really great friends. I think that's what makes the show really good. Thanks guys! Keep the truth and perspective coming!
"
79,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"Glenn's show on our local radio is on at a time when I can't always listen to it in the car.I love that I can listen to it on Stitcher. The Glenn Beck Program has been my favoriteshow since he's been on the air. I enjoy the content, the relevance, and his values; that he loves this country as much as I do, and points out that the goodness in the American people who feel the same way we do. He also has a great respect for the Founding Fathers and the vision they had for a radically new way of government. Plus, Glen, Stu, and Pat are hilarious! It's a great show.
"
80,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"With all of the media outlets out there with either a dedicated lean to the left or right, the Glenn Beck Program offers both sides of the story with the right usually bring the correct side. At least the left can't call him one-sided.
His guests are always extremely knowledgeable and well prepared to give the whole story.
In short, I recommend any true blooded American that needs to know the truth and then make their own decisions and not be manipulated into thinking one side or the other. Listen to this program!
"
81,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"Such a great way to find out what's ""really happening around the world"". So many trust the basic T.V. and radio stations- but these stations are owned by the rare few who all have the SAME point of view and have been in the gov's pocket for so long now, They have an agenda. Ever notice how the info on all the news stations get repeated OVER and OVER again, and who cares about whats being reported...the only current and pertinant info. comes from the Blaze...for as long as that lasts...
"
82,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"Glenn's radio broadcast can be a bit too sophomoric at times, a bit too libertarian, and occasionally a bit too conspiratorial for my liking, and yet he is all heart and you got to love it when he speaks passionately about the issues affecting our country. Our country is headed for rough times, and it's nice to hear someone is confronting this head on from the perspective of how our founding fathers would -- both politically and character wise.
"
83,The Glenn Beck Program,5,"Glenn has opened my eyes to so much history and persepective. I don't always agree, but a lot of what he says makes sense. It's unfortunate that so many people write him off due to a few clips they catch on MSNBC or the internet. Give him a chance, because he's not loyal to one political party. The show can also be quite funny at times. Pat, Stu and Jeffy will be the first to poke fun and there are many times when they're laughing so hard they can barely talk.
"
84,The Glenn Beck Program,4,"Although I'm not a diehard conservative, listening to Glenn Beck is very enlighting; he offers ""political news"" and expressions of opinions that are heartfelt and sincere, and mirroring the Founding Fathers philosophies. He avoids expressing pet peeves, and phrases his ideas in a manner rather hilarious at times; very appreciating because humor coupled with politics is something very rare.
"
85,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"Just got done listening to the Julia Louis Dreyfus episode which officially marks every episode this season as audio gold for me. It seems Conan got more comfortable with the platform as the season carried on and by the Timothy Olyphant episode I found my sides were splitting from laughing during the whole interview. I'll listen to them all again, but major standout episodes for me were with David Sedaris, Timothy Olyphant, Thomas Middleditch & Ben Schwartz, Bob Newhart, Martin Short, Mila Kunis, and Julia Louis Dreyfus. This and the Ron Burgandy podcast really make my day. I also wish I had the audio from the Fracture plug. That was hysterical.
"
86,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"I've forever loved Conan's humor. This podcast takes it to a different level. I feel like it is more of who he really is, he is allowed to be edgier, and I feel talk more candidly with his guests. I've listened to the first couple episodes so far and are in LOVE. It is a feel good, laugh your butt off podcast. Conan you are a king among men and I mean it. Your first episode with Will had me laughing so hard I had to park. You need links to the hilarious antics you reference. Thanks for brightening my day. Never stop ( unless its vaca time at the beach house )
"
87,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,4,"This episode is some kind of comedy opus, with Olyphant taking lead on a sublime meta bit and O'Brien following along. It's not entirely clear that Conan is in on the joke or even gets it at first. Honestly, I thought it was kinda cute when I listened, but failed to recognize actual genius until the next morning, when I woke up laughing about it. When the joke gets better over time, that's when you know you've witnessed comedic mastery. Why isn't Olyphant writing comedy??? Nobody thinks hot people are funny.
"
88,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"...in public, because everyone thinks I'm a lunatic who walks around by herself laughing out loud. I was at the dog park today listening, and I had to lean against a fence railing, crying laughing. People were concerned. I listen to lots of comedy podcasts, but this one should come with a warning label. Also, I'm living for the Conan - Sona interactions. Sona rules!
"
89,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"Conan has always been a huge fan of mine, I mean I have always been a huge fan of Conan, I guess. I love the guest Conan has on his show, from athlete to comedians to authors, it is very entertaining to hear a wide variety of guest. Matt and Sona are a lovely addition, plus it's fun hearing them make fun of Conan. As for Conan, it makes me day, hearing his voice only. I've been to a few live tapings of Conan and while he is tall, he is the actual definition of luminescent. I had to bring sunglasses to the show and I even sat all the way in the back. Anyway, keep up the good work Conan! P.S. I know the brains behind everything is Adam Blayert
"
90,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"I love Conan O'Brien and this is such a great format for him. His late night show has always been great but the whole genre has become formulaic and scripted. The Conan Without Borders show and this podcast are much more satisfying and give us a real idea of who Conan is. I've listened to some of the podcast episodes many times--the interviews with Pete Holmes, Adam Sandler, David Sedaris, and Dana Carvey are some of the funniest audio I've ever heard.
"
91,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"I would call myself a regular listener of over a dozen podcasts. I've never written a review before, but I am writing one now because this is the best podcast of the comedy/interview genre I've heard. I hope this podcast flies to the top of the charts. There are a lot of good podcasts in this style, but the production and performance of ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend"" is well above others. Conan's interviewing skills that have been honed for years show their strength in this format. He keeps it accessible, balances between comedy and ""real talk"", and avoids pitfalls of droning or too personal/strange lifestyle beliefs of celebrities. I think I listened to the Dana Carvey episode four times, and the Adam Sandler episode twice! I've only played an episode on one other podcast multiple times, that podcast being ""This American Life"". I believe this podcast will stretch beyond the audience that Conan already has, and it is an excellent way for people not familiar with Conan O'Brien to be introduced to a formative member of the comedy world. Also, Sona is awesome, she is the best podcast sidekick/assistant/host's-ego-deflater/#VoiceOfReason.
"
92,Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend,5,"There is no question about it: Conan is a skilled and engaging interviewer. We only see glimpses of it on his TV show, considering the limited air time. But here in this podcast, oh my, does his skill shine. I think the thing I like the most about this format is that the guest are not there to give canned stories and to promote their next project. They are actually there participating in the conversation. Sona is no slouch either. The way they banter with each other suggests that she is actually Conan's only friend.
Shout-out to this podcast's MVP, Matt Gourley. Your name doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Conan O'brien, but you take this podcast to another level, man. I loved your work on Jubjub.
"
93,Crime Junkie,4,"I definitely consider myself a ""crime junkie"" and I was struggling finding a podcast that could keep my attention. So on my many long drives, I gave crime junkie a try, and I have listened to every podcast since. My favorite part is getting home and going on their website and being able to see the pictures/videos they talk about on their podcast so I can follow along/better understand the case. It is fascinating learning all the details behind the crimes you only knew the surface of along with learning about crimes you never even heard of. I have even created my own ""If I Go Missing"" kit. This is/will be one of my top 3 crime podcasts ever!
"
94,Crime Junkie,2,"As a true crime podcast fanatic, this is my new go-to podcast. I notice that in much earlier episodes, the show seems to be a joint contribution between both hosts. In more recent episodes, the second narrator is distracting. Her input seems really scripted, to the point you can hear her trip over her words sometimes, and you can almost feel the irritation coming off of the main narrator who tends to just react to her friend the same way every time with a pause, saying 'right' and then moving immediately on. There are many co-hosted true crime podcasts out there (my personal favourite being MFM), and Crime Junkie really only needs the one main host.
"
95,Crime Junkie,5,"After listening to the latest 5 or so episodes then starting from episode one, I figured I had better give them some stars. After reading several of the reviews, I saw a lot of criticism for Brit. I will admit, she lost credibility for me after she brought up the McDonald Triangle, then couldn't actually confirm the third of the three identifying characteristics. So truthfully, some of the things she adds aren't super helpful, regardless, she keeps Ashley going and the chemistry and passion they have for the victims and the stories is what makes this a great podcast and people keep listening, so she is a value add and give her some credit!
"
96,Crime Junkie,4,"I've been obsessed with Crime Junkie since I found out about its existence. I love true crime and it's absolutely fascinating to her Ashley unpack a case for us. HOWEVER, like many other reviews have mentioned, Brit serves absolutely no purpose in the podcast. Her comments are always stuff like ""wait what?"" or ""Oh. my god."", doing absolutely NOTHING to the show, and quite frankly even take away from it. If Ashley and Brit are reading this, we as listeners are really saying this in the nicest and most productive way possible..please have Brit say more constructive or useful comments, instead of just sounds and words that are really disruptive to our listening experience. Thank you.
"
97,Crime Junkie,5,"Just started listening to this podcast and I'm interested in the content BUT I don't think the second narrator is helping the presentation. I hesitated writing this review because I don't like being negative but it's to the point that I almost do not want to listen to the podcast because of the second narrator. I do not find that any of her comments add value to the story, they just almost sound fake and over the top. I hope I can get over this one caveat because I think this podcast has a lot of potential to be one of the better true crime podcasts.
"
98,Crime Junkie,3,"I have listened to a lot of true crime podcasts and this one is in my top tier. The narrative is very well presented. My issue is with the almost Sorority style give and take between the hosts. I would like it if Brit could offer something different than color commentary. She could stand in for the audience and ask questions or play the devil's advocate with questions about the direction of the investigations. But the almost insincere ""ohs, ahs, no's"" get in the way of my own reactions. ""Body chills""? Stop!. Overused. And when Ashley reacts to Brit, its usually a flat, ""Yeah."", and carries on with the narrative. As though nothing had been said. Because it hasn't been. Brit needs a useful role in the broadcast. Color commentary isn't needed here. Chuck- don't change a thing. He's doing a great job. Almost there ladies.
"
99,Crime Junkie,4,"I love MANY things about this podcast. The stories are awesome. The music is great. Ashley seems to REALLY get into the stories and I love that. The ONE thing I cant stand (and I am sorry) is Brit... I am 100% not sure of her role here haha. Her comments are very scripted and uncomfortable. She crushes the vibe that you can tell Ashley puts a lot of effort behind. From her ""full body chills"" to her ""oh my gosh. noooo. stop."" commentary.. it just kills it for me. You can sometimes hear the cropping where they added in her side comments like she sat in a kitchen all day reciting reactions and they just add them in when they need them. Ashley your episodes alone were FANTASTIC and I encourage you give some thought to keeping it that way!
"
100,Crime Junkie,4,"I stumbled upon this podcast in my search for all things true crime related. Being from the Midwest myself, I can relate to a lot of the stories these girls tell. The cases are very interesting and you can tell they are well researched. Something I don’t love about this particular podcast is it sounds as though the girls record in completely separate rooms and at different times. It sounds very scripted at times, particularly when Brit speaks. They never talk over each other (which some people may like), but it just makes it seem a little fake, especially when there is a significant delay between when the girls speak. Overall I like the show and have listened to all of the episodes! You girls just might want to work on the script-y ness of how you speak, and maybe consider actually recording together at the same time? Just a thought.
"
101,The Ben Shapiro Show,5,"As Ben likes to say, ""two things can be true at once."" I find myself disagreeing with him on trans issues and religious freedom, the latter of which he seems to use as a screen to further cultural biases and bigotry toward LGBTQ community, plus he does omit key facts from his arguments to further an agenda. He is not a ""never-Trumper"" but is often critical of the pres, BUT he also equally as often argues ""Trump just says a lot of dumb stuff that doesn't mean anything,"" not holding pres to a higher standard. In fairness to Ben, he thoughtfully evaluates all the democratic opponents and has a great sense of humor.
"
102,The Ben Shapiro Show,1,"Ben Shapiro likes to present simple ""facts"" in a complex way, which is an excellent, well-worn method of distortion. And distortion is a lot of what Shapiro does. If Boris Johnson is Trump with some Latin, Ben Shapiro is Alex Jones with an encyclopaedia.
Shapiro's methods of argument are disingenuous, deflective and unfocused, but he goes on in such a pompous, esoteric way that by the time he's finished a sentence, the average person will have forgotten what he was trying to prove in the first place. Which is just as well, as he's seldom made a point, let alone one based in objectivity or truth.
"
103,The Ben Shapiro Show,4,"Only principled, honest, down-to-earth show of political analysis out there. A must for people who want to hear common sense.
"
104,The Ben Shapiro Show,1,"I have been following this show for almost 2 months, very gripping and compelling, sometimes funny, the kind of show you want! His ads are right and not invasive and crazy, like today's annoying ads, he does them himself, and they last a reasonable short time, not like exasperating ads you see almost everywhere on the radio and on tv, I am Italian, and my English learning has found a new stimulus to also enjoy and live the language other than just learning.
"
105,The Ben Shapiro Show,5,"Ben's great!!!! I love the fast pace he keeps. Informed and what young conservatives should be.
"
106,The Ben Shapiro Show,5,"Ben's fast paced style is packed with informed thought, wit, and brilliantly articulated commentary. This pod cast was my first full Ben Shapiro experience. It will not be my last.
"
107,The Ben Shapiro Show,5,"This Podcast does nothing to bring our country together, all Ben does is talk smack on liberals and Democrats, but then asks how come the country is so divided?!?! It's cause all he does is preach hatred toward the left daily so of course we're not going to listen to his rants! The poor right, all they do is complain about how the country is left leaning...it's cause the conservative views are outdated and no one agrees with them anymore!
"
108,The Ben Shapiro Show,5,"Ben is an articulate conservative with a good sense of humor. His persuasive logic can even make myopic liberals reassess their America loathing perspectives.
"
109,Pod Save America,4,"As personalities, I enjoy their informed point of view. Jon and Tommy provide insights into the behind the scenes discussions to shape policy.
But sometimes they can be condescending. The version of the show after the 2nd 2016 debate was off putting. And many of their guest are fellow technocrats that come off as out of touch or mean.
As the show grows they do get better. Instead of ranting about what Trump did today, they are connecting big issue policies to human consequences.
Best of luck to they guys. Hope they layoff the ""bed wetter"" talk and provide some entertaining & actionable information.
"
110,Pod Save America,3,"This is a great show for those who want to better understand what's happening and why it matters. For those of us who want to learn more about how to better engage with politics and make positive change, this is an awesome podcast. Also, it's funny.
"
111,Pod Save America,4,"The guys always have solid insights and balance partisan politics with giving credit where credit is (rarely) due. Overall, if you're looking for a good politics sanity check for the coming years, look no further. Looking forward to seeing where Crooked Media goes.
"
112,Pod Save America,5,"Right after the election, I enjoyed this podcast's focus on action items for everyday people who weren't sure exactly how to exercise their resistance to Trump. (In fact, I think they stated that as the purpose of the pod during the premiere episode.) But immediately afterward, this turned into a(nother) groaning discussion of all the disgusting things about the administration's actions without a whole lot of direction for those who already agree but want to DO something about it.
I already know my Congressman's phone number. I want some insider tips and creative ideas about how to really jam up the gears and exercise the atrophied muscles of democracy. I live in a supremely Republican district in an already red state with a rep who refuses to hold a town hall and doesn't announce his appearances in my area until they are already over. Please Obi-Wans, can you help me? If each episode contained an actionable idea for folks like me, it would be most helpful and welcome.
Also, personal peeve but perhaps constructive since I know people don't hear themselves the same way others hear them. Beginning every sentence with, ""Yeah so..."" and ending it with ""right"" becomes grating. Ex: ""Yeah so I think what's important to remember here is that Trump is a fascist, right.""
Thanks for allowing feedback and creating a vessel that can be used for good.
"
113,Pod Save America,5,"These four northeastern men all sound the exact same a lot of the time, and they all say the same thing repeatedly. So I don't suggest listening to the portions of the show where they sit around and agree with one another. But it is interesting to hear them interview some cool figures in politics today (it's also the only point in the show when you get the chance to hear a woman's point of view).
"
114,Pod Save America,3,"Super informative, sarcastic and smart. The perfect tone for staying informed with our new administration.
"
115,Pod Save America,3,"They got me through election year with Keepin' it 1600 and now I'm glad they are transitioning to the Crooked Media and committing to Podcast for America...I believe, I believe!
"
116,Pod Save America,5,"This podcast was for a brief time a must listen for me. The hosts are long time friends and clearly enjoy each others company and taking part in a podcast together. As former Obama staffers I was interested in their thoughts as the new administration sets about enacting it's horror show of white supremacy and their thoughts and experiences in comparison. Alas, aside from detailing the blatant disregard of norms and laws, I've found the overarching idea they have is that we need to gain democratic legislative power in 2018. That is not enough to counteract all that is unfolding and willfully blind to how Democrats have utterly failed to represent anything but unfettered capitalism with a few social provisions thrown to garner minority voters. As people who have been in the belly of the beast more thoughtful and perhaps damning recollection and analysis is necessary. If they really want to make a positive impact it is time to think less about puns you can make from the word 'cuck' and more about the failure of a political system and the failures of democrats.
"
117,Radiolab,5,"Entertaining. Intelligent. Mind-altering. Surprising. Pure brilliance.
This is the podcast that introduced me to podcasts. After listening to a few recent episodes, I dug through the archives and listened to absolutely everything there.
If you begin to think you're hearing information you already know, hang around -- there's always something unexpected around the bend. Check out the full episode ""Detective Stories"" for some mind-blowing awesomeness. Or the short called ""Unraveling Bolero"" for a bite-sized taste of the very best radio production currently out there.
Also: NERDCRUSH alert. Be careful, you may fall in love with both Jad and Robert. 
"
118,Radiolab,5,"This show is the best thing to happen to radio since the invention of radio! It's informative, entertaining, and unbiased. It's very refreshing to hear stories that actually are based on the facts provided and not some ""fox-news-esc"" opinion being presented as fact. And yes, there is opinionated debate at the end, but it is at the end, and doesn't cloud the facts of the stories you present. I think your recent episode ""60 Words"" is a prime example of this. I try to introduce anyone who will listen to Radiolab every chance I get and donate when I can. Thank you for all the stories and keep up the good work!!
"
119,Radiolab,5,"This show always has the most interesting and entertaining topics! The hosts are never afraid to ask the tough questions and never settle for anything short of the truth! I love this show and have downloaded nearly every podcast so I can listen to them in the car, on my iPod, and even show them in class! I am a college student, and I don't know how man times I have sited Radiolab in my research reports and essays. These guys are amazing, and I always manage to learn something new when I listen; even to podcasts I know by heart! I dont know what I would do without WNYC Radiolab!!! Keep it up guys!!! I'm always listening!!!
"
120,Radiolab,5,"Always topical and personally relevant. I always find my next book from them. Always aurally engrossing and mentally stimulating. I find myself thinking about shows all the time and relating and referring to past shows all the time. Jad and Robert are an amazing team and the show is constructed in a way that maximizes their contributions and helps the listener to hear both of their poins of view in a way that seems familiar, like the way we can argue a piont in our heads from different viewpoints. The masterful sound production adds to this feeling of internal argument all while we are learning the information. Masterful. The only way to improve would be more content which I would gladly absorb.
"
121,Radiolab,5,"Let me start by saying this is by far my favorite podcast. Every episode has a theme that unites all the stories in the episode in a poetic and succinct way. For example, in a recent episode, 'Blood,' I learned how fake blood is made, how Shakespeare drenches his work in references to blood, and precisely how the economy of blood donation works. The way this show disseminates scientific subject matter is really what makes it great; it includes interviews with experts, which Jad and Robert (the hosts) do great job of hashing out in layman's terms. All around phenomenal show.
P.S. The incredible sound design on this show is what made me realize how important sound design is.
"
122,Radiolab,5,"This show is for people who are curious about the world, and the connections that we can make between seemingly distant subjects: from ones studied solely in the ivory towers of academia to deeply human experiences that we each have felt or yearn for. This show tells the kinds of stories you won't find anywhere else. Pick a theme, any theme, and these guys will tell you how the start of the universe and the random distribution of particles at its early phases of evolution flow directly into the kind of relationship that a modern, tech-savvy couple might share. It's beautiful, it's elegant, it's curious, and it's original.
"
123,Radiolab,5,"I have learned about the most fascinating things from Radiolab, and the sound design they use to explain concepts that cannot be seen visually are brilliant. I prefer to ingest news/information aurally, and the sound design really helps cement certain scientific concepts or stories from guests on the show. The hosts seem to have an innate respect for their audience's intelligence. I've turned tons of friends on to the show, and I'm constantly texting with them about ""did you hear the one about the...."" Radiolab also has a fantastic live show that regrettably I haven't been able to see yet.
"
124,Radiolab,5,"Radiolab is the best thing on Stitcher -you could teach writing with this show as the text - the ideas are absorbing, and they are unwrapped in a way that affords listeners that same sense of excited discovery that surely must accompany all good science - and -- a production feature I think of as the ""scoring"" -- the audio miniatures that pop up to comment upon the narrative. Always spot on and surprising, never obvious. This show is really well done.
"
125,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),5,"For the first years, Freakonomics was a fun look focusing on the power of data, analysis, and science in looking at economic and social issues. It was powerful, and the banter between Dubner and Levitt was entertaining. Recently, and especially since the move to Stitcher, it has become more about anecdotal evidence - specifically, *long*, often dull interviews with various figures in the words of sports, business, economics and finance. I suppose these take less time and effort to produce, and it shows in the decrease in quality. Bring back the data, and return from opinion back to analysis!
"
126,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),2,"I really like the points of view that is disscussed on Freakonomics Radio. Whenever a point comes up it's very timely. It seems like I will often hear a discussion about the same or a similar topic on other shows like NPR or other news shows. I also feel like they really get to the nuts and bolts of a topic. In addition to good info, It is a healthy mix of serious and very funny and I like my information to have humor. I am more likely to remember. Not like your 9th grade science teacher that droned on with facts until you were drooling on you desk. Boo. Freakonomics Radio is worth every moment I spend listening. Give it a shot. You'll love it!!
"
127,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),3,"I love, love, love this show. When it's done I listen to it again to fill in my longing until the next one. I have learned more about society and the world from this show than from all of my years of school(18 yrs). From 5 minutes to 59 minutes every show is packed with enlightening and useful information. I tell everyone about Freakonomics so that the we can have long informed discussions. Talk about conversation starters.
"
128,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),5,"They used to actually talk about economics and sociology on this show. Now the host, Stephen Dubner, leads really unfocused discussions. There's no more insight anymore. The episode featuring Nate Silver had so much potential, but Dubner just asks him frivolous questions like, ""What's your favorite food?"" Also, why isn't Leavitt on the show anymore? He really is an economist. If you want a concise, insightful, and entertaining show about economics, listen to Planet Money from NPR.
"
129,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),5,"I generally enjoy this podcast and learn a lot - I was an economics major and generally appreciate the questions they ask and explore on the show. I've read the books and been a listener for a long time. However, Dubner's question asking style loses me about 7 out of 10 times - he asks painfully long and convoluted questions, where sometimes I literally have to stop the podcast and listen to something else...I find it that annoying. So please, Dubner, add some economy to your questioning style! Diminishing returns on long convoluted questions.
"
130,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),2,"Each show begins with a teaser that leads you to believe that it is going to be about one topic, which you may or may not find interesting. However, by the end of the show you are completely enthralled with how that initial teaser turned out to be something completely different and a highly relevant topic. The hosts do a great job laughing at themselves and their thought processes. Rather than presenting a show that comes from the 'ivory tower' it's content is practical.
"
131,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),3,"I once held an ignorant, close-minded position that economics was stupid, boring and only conservative Republican types would pursue it. Somehow I discovered Freakonomics and my position was changed! These episodes continue to affect me, as I find myself applying their interesting ideas to the things that I encounter during my day. This podcast is likely to appeal to people who are interested in sociology, social issues, current events, science, and the human condition. The delivery is lively and fascinating, and the Steves have fun personalities. This is not a dry or boring presentation by any means.
"
132,Freakonomics Radio (Stitcher Exclusive),5,"This show, along with the books, have been instrumental in my growth and education over the past 12-18 months. I've developed a passion for all things Economics, and have begun a journey of developing that passion into a new business venture. One of the foundations for my new found passion is this show! The show is interesting and thought provoking, I could not recommend it enough. It's full of intelligence, wit and most importantly - relevance. I'm getting through the entire portfolio of podcast and look forward to new editions. Thanks to all involved who make this show possible!
"
133,Office Ladies,5,"I am sooooooo thrilled and excited about this podcast! Both Mrs Fischer and Mrs Kinsey are so lovely and sweet to listen to, and its so much fun to have these two go in such depth about this show. You can tell how much this show means to them, as it means to the millions upon millions of fans this show has generated and continues to generate. HERE IS TO MANY MORE!
"
134,Office Ladies,3,"Oh, my, freaking, god. The story of how Phyllis landed her role, the auditioning process, and even the advice Gervais and Merchant gave the team before they started, this is a fandom GOLDMINE! I can't want for them to get to some of y favorite episodes, but honestly even after the first episode, I can tell the journey there will be amazing anyways.
"
135,Office Ladies,5,"When news broke that The Office would soon disappear from Netflix, I was, like most people taking the time to read these reviews, heartbroken. Though we're only 1 episode in, I can tell that the chemistry between these two besties will radiate throughout the podcast and provide charming, nostalgic insight into one my of favorite TV shows.. ever.
"
136,Office Ladies,5,"Very excited to sit at my office desk and listen to what ever shenanigans this podcast has in store!
"
137,Office Ladies,5,"This is just what I needed, been a die hard fan since day one and hoping that one day there would be a reboot or spin off or movie, anything to fill that void that was left when the show ended. Hopefully one day you girls will come up with a new spin off with a bunch of the old cast, maybe working at Dwight and Angela's bed and breakfast.......
"
138,Office Ladies,5,"One episode in and they already do such a great job of telling the stories behind the story. It's so cool to hear about the character development that went on through the actors and what were non-scripted things that became part of the show. Can't wait for more!!
"
139,Office Ladies,5,"Granted, it's the first episode but this podcast is exactly what I hoped for. The tidbits they offer are both humorous and interesting. They bounce off of each other well. It makes re-watching the series different and puts things in new light.
"
140,Office Ladies,5,"Great Podcast. KELEVEN stars from this 40-something Accountant, wife, mom, and Missouri native! I am a late-comer to The Office fan base but now I love it. My daughter attends TRUMAN STATE UNIV (Jenna's alma mater). I went with my daughter & friends to see Jenna speak on campus during her '19 book tour. The auditorium was packed; sadly I was likely the ONLY attendee with no ""OFFICE EXPERIENCE."" lol My daughter told me to at least persevere through Season 1 (cringy) and then decide. She was right (guess she IS learning some things in college). :) Love the show! Love this podcast! Angela, you ROCK. #accountantsrock
"
141,Up First,5,"I listen to this show before school every morning, as I get ready. It works as a good primer for any news I read or listen to on public transit. Don't expect in depth analysis, but do expect reliable, efficient news.
"
142,Up First,3,"RE: New FBI director. The reporter mentioned Joe Lieberman as a possible new FBI head with no mention of any objections to him. In fact, lots of people in Washington don't think a politician should be named director of the FBI. Also, top Democrats are opposed to Lieberman because of his checkered history with the party. A more thorough report would have included these points.
"
143,Up First,5,"All the major news points in a 12 minute package. Excellent compliment to Morning Edition.
"
144,Up First,5,"This is my go-to morning podcast! It's a great round up of the news you need to know. Great production quality to boot!
"
145,Spittin Chiclets,5,"Gents,
I wanted feedback, so here it is... the duration is probably perfect at just over an hour. I could probably listed all day, but with 1 hour, it keeps the audience wanting more. Any less, I believe would be too little. Keep up the great work. Just when I think you cannot top an interview, the next one is just as good. Coming from a guy who lives in Toronto, and spends a lot fo time in his car, it's a breath of fresh air to hear conversation about hockey that isn't TML overload. I am a TML fan, but every sports radio station talks about the same thing hour after hour, day after day. Keep it up and thanks for the laughs!
"
146,Spittin Chiclets,5,"...like being in a locker room with real people, yet these chowderheads somehow manage to have good discussions...awesome interviews...best antidote to the political, social crud that's trying to force my brain to bleed out of my head.
"
147,Spittin Chiclets,5,"#1 on my podcast list. hilarious and most entertaining. The best sports podcast I listen to, and quality went through the roof when Biznasty became a regular. Some of the best stories, and gives players a chance to really show some personality which is incredible for the NHL. More podcasts should take inspiration from this.
"
148,Spittin Chiclets,5,"I listen to a ton of podcasts, but never imagined I'd be willing to commit to episodes longer than 45 mins. This pod is so good. Props to the boys for the hilarious conversations, hockey updates and killer interviews. The people they get on this show though! Keep them coming, please. As a female listener, I second JR's suggestion of getting Kathryn on the pod.
"
149,Spittin Chiclets,5,"Great content. My son (12) and I listen separately and then discuss it later. Now when he walks into a room he says ""Hellooooooo Everybody"".
Best moment yet- watching the all star game and Lundquist is being interviewed- my leans over and says ""guys gotta wrench...""
He is a hockey player learning the unteachable side of the game!
"
150,Spittin Chiclets,5,"Boys-- Great show! My adult son, that I coached, turned me on to the show. Listening to you chat about Minor hockey and loving it. I coached youth hockey for 22 years and have heard and seen it all. I coached all levels and ages from having 150 kids on the ice for beginners to Bantam and Midget AA and AAA. Unbelievable stories, from parents that literally wanted to kill me, to ""moms"" that would ""hit"" on me for more ice time for their kid. Anyway many more stories that I would love to share. Keep up the great work and I'll keep listening
"
151,Spittin Chiclets,5,"I've been listening to this podcast from its early days and still love listening. I try to keep up but even when I fall behind, it's easy binge listen and catch up. Also - love that I don't have to listen to episodes in order either. The conversation is usually funny (though sometimes gross - as a sheltered woman who didn't play sports and never hung out with athletes - the topics can become quite graphic, but nothing I can't handle and still find funny). I LOVE the guests, especially when they are current or former Bruins players. Great show, with fun guys, and awesome guests. Wouldn't mind having a coach/president or two on, and get that perspective. Loved the Looch episode - he is a BEAST and the reason I started and continued watching hockey/am a diehard Bruins fan now. Keep it up!
"
152,Spittin Chiclets,5,"Love how you guy's get the guests to open up about stuff you would never here them say on other shows keep up the good work
"
153,Small Town Murder,5,"I love true crime podcasts and I have to say the humor you two put into this show is awesome. I laugh at pretty much all the stuff you guys say. I live in Reno and when you guys did the show on South Lake Tahoe I couldn't help but laugh. South Lake is a really beautiful area but only certain spots. I did let out a few chuckles when you pronounced some of the areas names wrong and I verbally corrected you as if you could hear me. Keep up the good work and I am very happy I stumbled upon your show. Once I finish all these episodes I will be going to your other show.
"
154,Small Town Murder,1,"I just discovered this show a few days ago. I am a small town Southern Illinois native, unfortunately. But I got out of the depressing area in my early 20's. :-)
The description and demographics in Episode #19 of Eldorado, IL is absolutely spot on in regards to how rural Southern Illinois actually is. My home town was a 'sun down' town too. They still to this day sound the 8:00 pm siren, which is the warning for 'people to get out of town'. Ridiculous! When I tell friends about this, they cannot believe it!
Keep up the good work gentlemen.
"
155,Small Town Murder,5,"Comedians covering true crime? Yes please!
James and Jimmie are funny and down to earth, and they manage to make stories about murders in small towns pretty darn hilarious. The research is really impressive - I've tried to look up some of the cases they cover, and the information is really sparse. James obviously spends a lot of time digging into court filings and the such. Because Jimmie doesn't know the story ahead of time, his reactions are incredibly raw and honest - I find myself yelling ""OH NO!"" right along with him. I look forward to new episodes every week, and I'm delighted to support their Patreon for bonus content!
"
156,Small Town Murder,5,"I never thought I would like a comedy twist to murder stories until now! Love what the hosts do here. Very entertaining and totally worth looking like a weirdo at work for laughing out of no where! Lol. Highly recommend a listen to this podcast. But as a disclaimer ""if you think comedy and true murder should never ever cross paths we shake hands and say thank you very much"" -James Pietragallo
"
157,Small Town Murder,5,"I love 85% of this show... when it hits, it HITS. when it drags, it DRAGS. it's like the girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead, and I can appreciate a healthy dose of variability and/or volatility. How. ever. The most annoying recurring dumb joke happens during the readout of the small town's ethnic un-diversity. WITHOUT FAIL, whenever there are low numbers of Asians, they make some crack about the town 'not liking Chinese food' or some bunk. First off, that's some small-town parochial jokery, and, second-off, it's a lazy joke. I'm just saying. I wanna give my full love, but for all they love to make fun of rural ppl's ignorance, I gotta say... disappointingly hypocritical.
"
158,Small Town Murder,5,"The 1st episode I listened to is #120 - Guns, Explosives & A Lion. A friend of mine told me about the murders in Duchesne, Utah and said I should listen to the podcast regarding it. I was up in the area over the weekend and drove past the ""crime scene"" before I listened to the episode. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Being from Utah, it made it that more hilarious. You guys are awesome! I am a huge fan now and started listening to your episodes from the beginning. All the ""Mormon"" comments are too funny and so true! Thanks for bringing comedy back into my life
"
159,Small Town Murder,4,"Following instructions! Love this show. Living in a small-ish town mentioned briefly in one ep (Columbia, MO) I love the humor brought to often brutal cases. A much needed laugh in a world of news with very little to laugh about.
"
160,Small Town Murder,5,"These guys are hilarious, and as a geographer (and small town resident), I freakin love their town and demographic descriptions. All the suspense and drama you want, blended perfectly with comedy throughout it, like the perfect milkshake of murder.
"
161,The Portal,5,"For someone who hasn't heard of the Weinstein brothers - they are a pair of highly accomplished researchers (Eric in Math / Geometrical Symmetry and Bret in Evolutionary Biology) who have both performed ground breaking work from first principles perspectives. Yet, they are also both rebels to the institutional systems of the universities and peer review. Listen with somber incredulity as Eric unpacks with guest after guest, domain after domain about the systemic failures that our existing incumbents, our hallowed pundits continue building on layer after layer. It's time to find ""The Portal"" before it's too late.
"
162,The Portal,5,"Possibly the most important podcast at the moment.
"
163,The Portal,5,"Engaging and well-produced. Looking forward to more episodes. Much respect for Eric and his work.
"
164,The Portal,5,"Eric curates his shows very thoughtfully and continues to surprise me with a great range of guests with perspectives that you won't find in MSM. His calm soothing voice is also why I keep tuning in. Keep it up Eric.
"
165,The Portal,5,"I really enjoyed the topics talked about and the host is great at explaining his views.
"
166,The Portal,5,"One of the best single podcasts by anyone, ever. Respectful dialog between smart people that do not agree on politics. We can have a disagreement and at the same time find common ground. Well Done!
"
167,The Portal,5,"This podcast provides deep insights into the world. The main thesis is that breakdown of our institutions has been damaging our society since the 70's. Each episode looks at a different institution to identify the breakdown and potential paths forward. My favorite episodes, of the 17 so far, are 1, 4, 5, 16, and 17.
I listen to the first 45 minutes of each episode while stretching (not my full attention) to see if I'm interested in the topic. If so, I'll start from the beginning and take notes as I go (full attention). In my opinion only maybe 1 out of every 4 episodes has those ""you just blew my mind"" realization moments, but when they happen they are so impactful that the podcast still deserves 5 stars.
What can be frustrating is that Eric clearly has well thought out theories, but instead of just spending 45 minutes talking through these theories, he talks through them bit by bit with guests. I would prefer if he broke the episode into two parts, so I could see the full theory before he tries to debate it with the guest. Eric is funny and willing to say the things that most people are afraid to say for fear of damage to their reputation. Definitely worth a listen!
To understand my taste, I also listen to Building Local Power, the Joe Rogan Experience, and the Realignment. I think Sam Harris is non-erudite (to use a Taleb term).
"
168,Planet Money,5,"I came to Planet Money in an attempt to understand the economic meltdown that was unfolding in 2009. Once I started, I could not stop. I find the stories interesting, compelling, and thought provoking. I use Stitcher to download the episodes and I listen to them through a headset while mowing the grass. An interesting juxtaposition of activities - mowing the grass is the one thing in my life I can control and fully complete - neat straight lines, tight turns; While Planet Money describes the obtuse interconnections of economic theories and our daily lives.
"
169,Planet Money,2,"Planet Money is educational, but doesn't feel that way. It does an excellent job of both teaching complex ideas through easy to understand real world examples as well as showing how the economy works on the personal level. I use this with my economics classes, and the students love it.
The overall tone of the show is light and slightly comedic which helps to keep the audience's attention, but while you are being entertained you feel like you're learning something that most people don't know anything about. Its always interesting, and I just wish the episodes came out daily.
"
170,Planet Money,5,"Pure fun to listen too on the dullest topics of $ and the economy!!  They report real stories and issues in a storytelling/reporting style and explain complicated financial principals so that anyone without a financial background can easily understand them.  No other show in history has been able to make such topics so easy to understand and so much fun to listen too!!  Do yourself a favor and download this podcast!!  Do not let the NPR and money title fool you into thinking this is a boring show because its one of my favorite podcast and I have listened to 100s of diff shows and I am so excited whenever they release a new one!!  Thank you planet money and please keep up the great work!!!
"
171,Planet Money,5,"More re-runs than new shows nowadays. There's also a lot of politics recently. I've gotten halfway through a few new shows and not heard anything about the economy. It seems there's more glory in reporting on politics nowadays, but that's not what I listen to Planet Money for. The Indicator is still quite good, though.
"
172,Planet Money,5,"I'd like to comment on the show ""Small Change"" - one factor that has slowed productivity is addiction and other mental health disorders. The show did not mention the trillion dollars annually of damage and destruction done to our economy by addiction and other mental health disorders. Love Planet Money!
"
173,Planet Money,2,"This podcast is well-edited, comes out frequently and never uninteresting. I got my bachelors in econ, but you need no economics training to enjoy this.
"
174,Planet Money,5,"Being a longtime This American Life listener I was introduced to these guys on their episodes devoted to the recent financial meltdown. They did about 3 entire 60 minute episodes, and it was by far the most incisive, comprehensible reporting I had heard on that complex subject. 
They do more of the same with their own podcast, taking one small subject at a time and covering it cleverly and entertainingly. Freakanomics Radio is a similar show. I couldn't say which was better...I listen to them both each week.
"
175,Planet Money,5,"I know we have to find young people now to do everything, but I like shows hosted by people who know things. The new host not only has little knowledge of finance, but seems proud of it.
"
176,Fresh Air,5,"Terri Gross has the most soothing voice, and even though I'm sure she has her own personal opinions on the subjects she covers, it doesnt come out in her questioning. It is always obvious that she has well researched her topic and her questions come across as so. Her introductions are informative (in case you are not up to date on the subject) and she makes a conscience effort to clarify throughout the interview.
Other than being just a fan of Ms Gross, the people they choose to come on and the subjects they talk about are a good mix. From serious and socially conscience to healthy living, to entertainment.
"
177,Fresh Air,5,"I love Fresh Air. The interviews are in depth and compassionate.  I feel like I get to know the guests.  Terry isn't afraid to ask the hard questions, sometimes even to the point of all of us squirming a bit.  I love that she'll have Gene Simmons from Kiss being rude and outrageous or that she'll cry with Maurice Sendak. They are all facets of humanity for us to meet and understand. Fresh Air brings the world to me, even in my small town America. I'm grateful that Stitcher allows me to stream previous episodes so I don't have to miss them anymore. 
"
178,Fresh Air,5,"Fresh Air is easily my most favorite podcast. The interviews and subject matter are always presented in an interesting and informative way, and grab my attention even when I am not expecting it. Teri Gross always asks the questions that I would ask if I had the opportunity, and does it in such a way that does not antagonize the interviewee, or put them on the defensive. Sometimes more than one subject is covered in the one-hour show, and Stitcher will often break these segments up into separate programs, which can be disconcerting if I'm trying to listen to an entire show.
"
179,Fresh Air,5,"The craft of interviewing seems complex. The interviewer has to probe deep enough to reveal fresh insights with out offending, angering or sending the interview subject in to retreat. Currently there may be a handful of adept interviewers in all American media. Terry Gross is among the very best. Countless times I have listened as she skillfully brought new life to the stories behind some of the worlds most interesting people. It is always time well spent.  
"
180,Fresh Air,4,"Terri gross is the best interview!  Love it! Love it!
"
181,Fresh Air,5,"I have listen to Terry Gross for over 20 years. She is usually gives a fair interview, no matter what their platform is. I really admire Terry Gross. I am disappointed, and this not have to do with Stitcher, that it is not the whole show. I try to listen to it on my local FM radio station, but sometimes I cannot get good reception, so this is a good alternative, but it is a shortened version.
"
182,Fresh Air,5,"I have listened to Fresh Air for years and I find it interesting and informative. I don't know how Terri Gross does it - keep up with things, do research and interview people who sometimes don't respond well. She has a good sense of humor about it but I think that sometimes she must roll her eyes when she runs into an oddball. I heard that some of her interviews are done via the phone (not sure about that) but if that's the case, then I'm even more impressed. This is, in fact, my favorite NPR radio program.
"
183,Fresh Air,5,"One day she's discussing Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, the next the science of sleep. Terry Gross has virtually unmatched intellectual dexterity. Every day's an unexpected treat
"
184,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"""Wait wait don't tell me"" is the podcast I look forward to the most every week. It is the only one I don't mind listening to even on the rare off weeks when they re-run old clips (which I now have heard almost all of). I like this show so much that my fiance now has a rule that I'm not allowed to talk about it at dinner...because for a short time it was beginning to be my favorite and only conversation topic. Peter, Carl, and the panelists all participate in the discussions and interviews with such intelligent, self aware, and creative commentary and questions. I am also a proud Paula Poundstone devote. Keep killin it!    
"
185,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"One of my big treats to myself every weekend is to listen to Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me. I pride myself on being able to answer most of the current event quizzes before the guests can. I love the host's dry humor and how they pick out music that is a commentary on the quiz that's just ended. The guests are mostly comedians, but this past week they invited past ""Not My Job"" contestant Neko Case, the singer, and she did GREAT--keep inviting her back, you guys! Since they changed the schedule at my local public radio station and it's no longer on at a convenient time for me to listen, Stitcher has been a lifesaver. I can listen anytime I want and not have to download any files.
"
186,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"This show is hilarious. It's not only informative and interesting it also makes you laugh while your learning. You get the chance to listen to an amazing and often rotating panel of witty judges. Though others are quizzed I am often times finding myself responding to their questions out loud wherever I am. I have been listening to this show since I was a child while my parents put NPR on every weekend. It helps me get through my week and the option of a podcast makes it so I can actually listen to it when I have time! I can't talk it up enough to really describe how awesome the show is. I would start a grand protest if it were ever in danger of being discontinued.
"
187,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"there is no better cross-section of news and humor and humanity than Wait Wait. its a show nearly anyone can appreciate. whether you are news hound or just someone who likes a good off-the-cuff joke. between the call-in segments and the guests and the host (Peter Segel) -- its a rare win-win.
i look forward to it every week. sometimes i even save them up for long trips. and it never hurts to listen to past episodes.
Wait Wait is not only entertaining as a podcast, it will likely stand as a great example of new radio culture and programming in years to come. it is a cultural gem and will be a valuable cultural artifact for future generations.
high praise, yes. but well-earned.
"
188,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"I absolutely LOVE listening to this show. The only thing that could make it be better is if there were video to go with it (I know, tough to do with radio). If anyone has seen ""Whose line is it anyway?"", or seen impromptu comedy skits at local shows, then this show is for you!
What makes it better is that there is listener interaction with some of the games that they play, and they enjoy poking fun at each other, if not themselves. This is THE reason I have Stitcher on my Kindle, and can't wait for new episodes to come out.
"
189,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"Do you like a humorous take on current news with some of the funniest comedians? Tune in! Every episode has laugh out loud moments. Everyone that I've shared this with has enjoyed it from young to old.
"
190,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"Once I finally started listening to this program, I became an instant die-hard. It's often laugh-out-loud funny, witty, self-deprecating, and one program that I make sure to listen to every week.  The show is engaging, because as a quiz show, the listener can play along mentally, while also being entertained. The content is current events, so one actually has a good chance to know answers.  Because the group of panelists rotates every week, the show maintains a feeling of both freshness & familiarity.  Just take my word for it, and LISTEN! You'll be glad you did!
"
191,Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!,5,"My favorite podcast with host Peter Sagal along with Carl Kassell and the ever changing guests. This show is very entertaining and I always learn something new. The show has a wide variety of guests each week and the quizzes are fun to play along with. The panelists are funny, witty and quick. I love the way Peter always sounds so surprised when the call-in listener gets the answers correct to the puzzles! You can tell this group really enjoys making the show. Their spontaneity and humor keeps me laughing. If you haven't tuned in yet, you're missing out!
"
192,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"TMS is such a well made podcast. I eagerly awaited their debut on 4/1/19 and can't wait to hear the next episode each Monday. I love that they are reaching out to the public to try to help solve cold case murders because someone out there has to have seen something but they may not have known it at the time. Hopefully this podcast will get some cases closed and give families some closure. Well done!!
"
193,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"An investigative reporter that does excellent research and a nationally known cold case investigator team up to bring us unsolved cases. They provide us with as much info as possible to allow listeners to examine the evidence and maybe bring answers to the cases. If you like true crime, quality research and professional insight on unsolved cases you should like this podcast.
"
194,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"Given the nature of my work, I listen to podcasts 6 hrs a day for two weeks of each month. I listen to a lot of unsolved case podcasts. There are many good ones, but Billy and Paul are by far my favorite. With the many of years of experience in their respective professions, Great voices, clear articulation, and relaxed and comfortable nature I am drawn to their podcast and look forward to going to work so I can catch up listening to them. I don't hear noise in the background nor do other voices bother me. The only thing that I wish was different is that they did daily podcasts so that when I went to work I had two weeks of previous episodes to catch up and two current weeks. I had no idea how many unsolved crimes there are and this podcast has certainly sparked me to take notice of my environment and who is around me! Thank you Billy and Paul.
"
195,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"Great show so far guys! Very excited to see what comes of all the information and helping close cases. This was a great idea!
"
196,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"Very well done, listens like a thrilling movie. Thank you for your service and your compassion. True heros.
"
197,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,4,"Stop pouring water in the background! So distracting. Otherwise awesome!
"
198,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"Have been listening on other apps but wanted to make sure they got the review they deserve. Paul and Billy are a great team and I can't wait to see what else they come up with. I am forever impressed with them, and all of their guests. How cool is it that they know so many people, both investigators and relatives of survivors and victims?!

199,Jensen and Holes: The Murder Squad,5,"Some days, I think I'm just here to listen to Paul Holes illustrate again and again how it was to be a professional that was thoroughly engrossed in his work to the exclusion of much else. Billy Jensen is the perfect foil to the sometimes clueless (on pop culture references, only) Holes. We hear so much about balance these days, but we forget that people who are really good at their jobs may not have that balance we get preached to about. Keep up the great work, guys! You are a super listen.

200,The Read,5,"Tired of people beating around the bush when they talk about Miley Cyrus' foolishness? Is your ex quickly turning into one of the characters on ""Love and Hip-Hop: Atlanta?"" Did an acquaintance really just call Beyoncé ""mediocre?""
Do yourself a favor: press play on an episode (or 10) of The Read.
"
201,The Read,2,"I have been listening to this podcast since the beginning as I was a follower of both Crissle and Kid Fury from twitter. This show beat my expectations. One, both of them are not only hilarious, opinionated and engaging, but also smart and well informed. I also like the fact they don't feel the need to be gimmicky or insulting to their audience to get listeners. Kid Fury is like the Will to my Grace and Crissle is like the only cousin you know that has any common sense and whose calls you would actually answer. 
"
202,The Read,5,"This podcast is EVERYTHING! I love the banter between Fury & Crissle. The show is hilarious, uplifting and the reads are sometimes the most empowering messages I have heard all week. They're discussions on race and gender issues are more informed and educational than I would ever expected from a ""celeb-gossip"" podcast. I do wish they would stop using the ""N"" word so much since it undermines the whole idea of black empowerment and has made me reluctant to share this awesome show with my friends.
"
203,The Read,5,"The only way to describe The Read is like a conversation with your best friends. Kid Fury and Crissle are intelligent and hilarious. The show is well produced and ads are tasteful. You have to be okay with profanities.. but otherwise great.
"
204,The Read,5,"What can I NOT say about Kid Fury and Crissle? I truly STAND for them! They delight me with their perspectives on pop culture, the rawness (and truth) to the advice that they give and their commitment to engaging in real dialogue around the issues that matter to black folks and urban culture in general. Their ""Reads"" often inspire me and make me proud to know that these very intelligent young minds care about real issues and breaking barriers that consistently plague our society. Read On!!
"
205,The Read,5,"Is it the unfiltered commentary on celebrity foolishness or the no holds barred take on contemporary issues that are facing the country that makes me love the show so? Why not say both?
"
206,The Read,5,"Kid Fury and Crissle say the majority of the things I think in my head! Their on air shenanigans are very funny and their insight into pop-culture and human relations is unique. The culmination of the show is their individual reads, where they “read” (tell people about how stupid they are) people who need to get their lives together. I have been addicted for well over a year now, and even with the incessant beyonce staning, I love them. Listen to them and you will too!
"
207,The Read,5,"The very best show to start off a thirsty thursday with
"
208,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,4,"I’m a few episodes in and really enjoying the show! I like how honest he is, and the first episode with Kristen was vulnerable and relatable. I gave it 4 stars because I don’t love the “fact checking” at the end. It just seems super nit-picky and not really needed for this type of podcast. I can understand wanting to clear up a few things, but from the episodes I’ve listened to so far, her commentary was entirely unneeded and frankly a bit annoying, especially as it goes on for 15-20 minutes. If you’re really wanting to continue down this road, maybe make it a bit more light-hearted and fun? Other than that, super enjoyable!
"
209,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,2,"I have really been enjoying this podcast. I find Dax to be very charming and entertaining, and Monica is such a sweet and smart little cookie. So I was super bummed when I listened to the Good Place week interview with Kristen Bell. Oy with the self love!!! It really felt super narcissistic and a bit obnoxious. I also say this with nothing but love. I am happy that you have an enlightened marriage, and you guys overly love Monica to the point that it sounds like she is a pet rather than a person.....am I wrong ? I don't know....it just put me in a bad mood...but I rely on this podcast to put me in a good mood. Anyhow, like I said, this is all said with love. Cheers from an armcherry. xo
"
210,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,4,"This is one of my favorite podcasts I have ever heard. I enjoy the real life aspect that Dax brings to everything he does. I have listened to the first 5 episodes in less than 24 hours. I will be listening as long as Dax is talking!
"
211,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,3,"So happy I discovered this. I'm addicted! I love both Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, but I was really hesitant to listen to the Kristen Bell episode in fear it would make me feel bad about my own marriage, since there's seems so perfect. I'm so glad I changed my mind and gave it a listen. It made me respect both of them much more, and I really appreciated their honesty mixed with the humor :)
"
212,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,5,"I love listening to dax and monica, and honestly wish they'd release more shows!! Also, come to portland and do a live show peeps! Ive seen a lot of people complain about the fact check, but its usually my favorite part lol. As an addict who has been sober 8 years, I find it interesting to hear another person's take on it. Hearing someone else's personal inventory actually helps me check in with mine! I also love how different Dax and Monica are. They clearly love each other, but they disagree on A LOT. I think this is such a great example in this polarizing time of two people who disagree on a lot, but can still come together and agree on the things that truly matter in the world.
"
213,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,5,"I've been listening to this podcast for awhile now and even went back to listen to older ones. I love the insight and questions that Dax prepares for each guest, however I really wish Monica would sincerely laugh (her fake laugh is cringe). Secondly when speaking with Ezra Klein, Dax mentions that politics doesn't need to be a topic of discussion at every dinner table... Monica basically responds by saying I think it is and that ""those who want to lock kids in cages are people she would not want to speak with""- Monica needs to not be so narrow minded, I hope she realizes how many people discredited her knowledge/understanding off that one comment. Love the podcast #Bernieforpresident
"
214,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,5,"I am hooked, I can not wait to hear more. So entertaining!
"
215,Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,4,"Dax gets incredible guests and then wastes their time and ours by interrupting and talking over them. To me, his style reveals a level of ego that belies a deep insecurity buried not that far beneath the surface. There's potential here - I'll check back in a year to see if he has grown as a host.
"
216,The Viall Files,5,"I LOVE that you can watch it on YouTube. I’m a visual person so it def is a huge plus. & I mean...Nick isn’t too bad on the eyes. I adore Rchelle. I love how nick treats her as well. He genuinely seems to love her(not saying romantically lol) but yeah, shes so cute & truly seems like such a doll! I feel like on the few times I don’t agree with Nicks outlook, she pulls through.lol I appreciate the VERY consistent uploads & length of the videos. Content & conversation never bores Me which is rare! Oh...and he’s def improved since the first few episodes in regards to interviewing people! Lol I recommend!
"
217,The Viall Files,2,"I'm not sure how much longer I will be able to listen now that Sug is on all the time. It's excruciating. Too bad...I always enjoyed hearing Nick's viewpoint.
"
218,The Viall Files,5,"Being a female software engineer who is only remotely interested in software...eh remotely seems generous... stuck with all the blinds on the windows shut, guys who are flatulent all day, and the heavy scent of BO and Pizza. I will say besides the free coffee, this podcast actually gets me through the day - so thank you.
"
219,The Viall Files,5,"I am someone who NORMALLY binges true crime podcasts. I was just browsing around and stumbled upon The Viall Files. I wasn't sure I would like it since it wasn't my norm but I love the bachelor / bachelorette and I really liked Nick so I gave it a try. Now I am obsessed! I binged the 4 or 5 that were available when I found it and now keep up as they air. Nick does a great job hosting and I love all the guests he brings on. The show so versatile and entertaining.
"
220,The Viall Files,5,"This show is a great listen! You learn about the guest and get some great commentary and insight on the Bachelor Series. The advice section is uplifting, especially for anyone lost in the quagmire that is the 2019 dating scene!
"
221,The Viall Files,5,"To those who are writing 1 star reviews because of Nick's mansplaining, although he was initially defensive (as most are when their character is called into question) He means well and is open to listening and learning and always has Rachelle (sp?) to call him out if he needs it. I enjoy this podcast and feel that Nick is very articulate and at the same time authentic and engaging. His podcast episodes are fun and a good listen.
"
222,The Viall Files,5,"I'm so happy I started listening to this podcast. It's so entertaining. The guest hosts are great and offer great advice and insights to situations that can be applied to anyone. I love how real everyone gets. It gets me through the day when I listen at work. Can't wait to keep listening
"
223,The Viall Files,3,"I really enjoy listening to the Viall Files, and am always so impressed with his depth of advice on his Ask Nick segments. I also enjoy when he has guests on too, as they are either someone from the Bachelor world, or a guest you can learn something from. However, I just couldn't get through the episode with Morgan Stewart. She is so self absorbed and just not a fun listen. Nothing to learn from, nothing. I get she's Nick friend, but that one I skipped.
"
224,Reply All,5,"Some things are always, inevitably, good. The wafting deliciousness of cookies baking. Stretching out in the sunshine at your favorite beach. The Reply All podcast. If you're old enough to remember regular radio, you might recall the way you'd come to think of certain DJs as your friends – you'd listen as much to catch up with them as for the music. Like that, PJ and Alex are your fine new pals. If you're too young to relate to that, think of PJ and Alex as the goofy camp counselors of your internet heart. Which doesn't really make much sense as a metaphor, but hey, you know what does make sense? Listening to Reply All. Because it's fantastic. Fun and funny, smart and weird, just great. Sometimes it's sad (What It Looks Like), sometimes hilarious (Today's the Day), sometimes just odd (Zardulu). But always great.
"
225,Reply All,5,"I'm glad that Stitcher doesn't pull a Netflix and ask me if I'm still listening when I'm going on my 10th episode of Reply All because I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. This is one of those podcasts that is hard to pin down- yes, it's technically a tech podcast- but it's also incredibly interesting, well researched, funny, authentic, and binge-worthy. Crossing my fingers that I have super tech support problem that I can throw your way sometime soon..
"
226,Reply All,5,"Depending on the episode, you might find: the poignancy of a good ""This American Life"" episode, the slickness of a ""mini-Serial"", the investigative journalism of a ""Reveal"", the nerdy cool of a tech show. Just worth listening to. Keep it up PJ and Alex!
"
227,Reply All,2,"Reply All used to be my go to podcast and a great show. Just unsubscribed though since the last few months at least there is no new content, just old episodes. Should be called REPLAY ALL at this point. Gimlet is like this now across the board unfortunately and has been for a while. Replay all was one of the last shows I held on to. When its years between episodes (heavyweight) and the new shows like Sandra launch with what 4 episodes a year...now Replay All is going downhill fast too :( UGH. Must be that new show no one watches taking up the time and money, sure isnt the podcasts
"
228,Reply All,5,"Can't stop thinking about the pizza rat/ Zardulu lowdown and the investigation into whether or not facebook is listening in on my phone. I learn so much and look forward to every episode.
"
229,Reply All,5,"Great hosts, interesting content, and an engaging format. Keep it up, guys!
"
230,Reply All,5,"I am a bit of a podcast addict and no other show gets me as excited for a new episode as Reply All. The hosts are charismatic, funny, and most of all completely tireless in their their pursuit of compelling, socially pertinent, thought provoking, and often mindblowingly wacky stories. They're stories often begin with a seemingly simple question or problem, but through an insanely tenacious journalistic approach, the twists turns, and revelations about the modern world they uncover are absolutely spellbinding. Cannot recommend this podcast enough.
"
231,Reply All,4,"There have been some shows that are more fascinating than fiction, like when Alex befriends an Indian computer scammer, they find out the source of mysterious voicemail messages to an 800 number, and they discover how (and why) an Instagram account got hacked. There is some friendly repartee between the two hosts, which some may find endearing and others may find grating. The yes-yes-no segments unpack a posting on the Internet, which I always find informative and engaging but rarely of any practical use. Always interesting, sometimes great.
"
232,Casefile True Crime,5,"The podcast is amazing. The level of detail and character background is incredible. Some of the most harrowing stories I have ever heard. As an Australian myself, listening to serial and other infamous American podcasts - I'm ashamed so many awful atrocities have occurred in Australia.... but I think it's really good to finally have an Australian podcast! I say keep the cases Australian!
The host! What a case file himself... BRILLIANT VOICE could listen forever. Really enjoy the way he chimes in on how horrendous and sick these killers are.
Would really love to hear a case on Daniel Morcombe. Keep up the excellent work - Thanks for such quality.
"
233,Casefile True Crime,1,"Gripping cases, perfect detail and no excessive amounts of commentary regarding un-needed violent descriptions. I went from having zero interest in true crime as a subject before i started listening , to it being my favorite topic to hear/read about now.
I want to say thanks to the host for providing a compelling and thrilling dialogue on all the episodes and also thanks to the research team, who put in what i imagine is days of solid fact digging from all parties involved in the case. The podcasts are truly getting better each time and the amount of information collected in the ""Moors Murder"" case for example, was just outstanding.
Keep up the exceptional work rate and I'm certain big things are headed for this podcast's future. Cant wait to be along for the ride!
"
234,Casefile True Crime,5,"I just started listening to this podcast, and I've already binged most of the series.
I enjoy the storytelling and research behind each episode. Each case unfolds in a way that keeps me interested and speculating about how it will end. Even when a case is unsolved, I feel satisfied at the end of the podcast.
I like the narrator's frank style as well! I enjoy his accent, and certain word choices make me smile (even while listening to serious stories). ""Surfy teen"".
"
235,Casefile True Crime,5,"I don't just mean true crime, I actually mean podcast. Casey's voice is perfect suited for telling these gritty stories. The writers and producers do a fantastic job on each and every podcast and we don't just get murder stories, there has been a variety of crime covered. Getting updates on previous episodes is AMAZING, I loved when EARONS/GSK was captured and we got the quick scoop, I didn't have anyone I could freak out with in person but I got to spaz with Casefile about it.
There isn't banter or silliness during the cases and I appreciate this. I want facts and I get those from this podcast.
"
236,Casefile True Crime,5,"This podcast is well researched, well written and well narrated. The host’s voice is well suited for such an undertaking; his tempo and tone perfect for the subject matter. I've listened to a lot of true crime podcasts and, IMO, this is the indisputable front runner. Having gleefully binged my way to the latest episode, I now look forward to a new one being dropped every week or two and I sincerely hope they continue for a long time to come. I also hope the ""anonymous host"" continues - for me, he is Casefile, his anonymity adds a unique aspect and the show would not be the same without him. This podcast is quality. If you haven’t already, give it a listen.
"
237,Casefile True Crime,5,"I started listening to this podcast just after the first episode came out in January. I wished there was a way to contact the guy who makes it to thank him. Hopefully he'll read it here.
I love that the victims are treated with respect, as is the audience. No over-fixation on the salacious or gruesome details, just a presentation of the people involved. The voice, music and sound quality are excellent too. I look forward to it every week and hope for some longer, in depth episodes like the first one.
"
238,Casefile True Crime,5,"I love this podcast. Host has clearly spent time outlining and writing these cases to excellent effect. The episodes are thorough, engaging, and well-produced. I greatly appreciate that he draws on cases outside the US so there are a lot of new mysteries to ponder. Excellent show.
"
239,Casefile True Crime,5,"I enjoyed this three part series sooo much! Thank you for such a well thought out and clearly presented podcast! One question - what happened to VARIETY JONES? There was no epilogue for him and I was waiting for the identity of this person.
"
240,Armstrong & Getty,5,"I have been listening to A&G for 15 years now (started listening in the morning on my way to morning practice in high school with my dad). I love them because it's a good way to keep up on politics and current events while staying entertained and not getting depressed about things in the news. They are both libertarian guys believing that limiting government does the most good for the most people, but they are still fair and call out those on the right when they are hypocrites, liars, etc. Listen to this show every day for a week and you will be hooked for life!
"
241,Armstrong & Getty,1,"I love this show so much that I come home and tell my wife about at least one segment from the show everyday. She says Jack and Joe (the hosts) are my radio besties (Best friends). I can not give this show high enough praise. They are fun, informative and very involved in trying to make out town, state, country, world a better place. It is a show that should be heard by all... You will learn, and enjoy your time listening. 
"
242,Armstrong & Getty,5,"I have been a loyal listener to A and G for 13 years. I travel the country for my job. A rely heavily on the A&g podcast. They are without exception the best radio in our 50 states. Their deprecating and honest takes are far superior to all the competitions agenda driven tripe. Stay strong Jack and Joe.
"
243,Armstrong & Getty,5,"They will make you belly laugh and your head think. Eriudite yet human, topical but never boring. They can make you mad one minute reporting on the giverment and happy the next reminding you that life is too short to stay stuck on stupid. Funny yet urbane, homespun and yet sophisticated. It's a free box of chocolates every morning. Enjoy!
"
244,Armstrong & Getty,5,"These guys are so consistently funny, smart, and entertaining that I could easily listen to them 3 hours a day (the length of their show) if I could find the time!
"
245,Armstrong & Getty,5,"A&G manage to be entertaining and informative, thankfully without quite going the full ""morning zoo crew."" The point of view of the show is that of a lively populist conservatism, but is usually good-natured enough not to alienate folks of any political stripe. All that, and sometimes someone on the show gets tasered!
"
246,Armstrong & Getty,5,"Topical and entertaining without the whiny awfulness of other talk platforms. I get updated on news that is actually meaningful with entertaining and thoughtful discussion. Did I mention hilarity? Hilarity.
"
247,Armstrong & Getty,4,"These guys are insufferable in their arrogance and ignorance. They are just educated enough that they can use big words and references that make it sound to people who don't know better like they are smart and they pull the adolescent trick of putting on the ""so much more experienced than thou"" attitude and a pretense of being open-minded when they are far from it. What is dangerous is that their listeners fall for it. If they really cared about the welfare of the world, they would recognize that they are far too ignorant to have the voice they have and they would take themselves off the air.
"
248,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"Mark Levin is undoubtedly the most knowledgeable and intelligent ""constitutionalist"" in talk radio. No one, not even Rush Limbaugh, has his depth of insight into our uniquely American system of government. Even after years of listening and learning, Mark continues to surprise me with new information about that ""old, dusty"" document. Plus I love his daily ""hat tips"" to one of my other favorite radio hosts, Bob Grant, RIP, through his no-nonsense approach to his daily topics and his unwavering display of disgust towards the occasional ""drone""... his word for mindless progressive supporters of big, unconstitutional government. Bravo, Mark!
"
249,Mark Levin Podcast,1,"If you really want to understand whats going on in our country& our government, then mark Levin is the man to listen to He worked in the justice Department during the Reagan administration,and I believe he is a constitutional scholar. listen to him live or listen to his pod casts like me. I promise that if you will listen to his show for just one month consistently , your eyes will be opened like they haven't been opened before. be sure to read his books like Liberty & tyranny ,And his most recent book The liberty amendments.Its on restoring the American republic;that we are losing.
"
250,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"No holds barred intellectual conservative talk at its best. In any one podcast, you will learn about current events that others aren't reporting, and may get a dose of Constitutional history, facts about our Founding Fathers and other historical figures, learn how the branches of government are supposed to operate, and more. Time very well spent, and the Stitcher podcast is void of most commercial breaks, so you get all Mark most all the time. If you are a conservative (or just interested in learning what's really going on in our country) Mr. Levin will not disappoint.
"
251,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"What an astounding array of information given here. Mark gives an in depth analysis of America's past and present using factual information, in a fresh, yet traditional constitutional respect for his country. What an inspiration, and an absolute pleasure to have stumbled upon here. There are many great radio shows out there, many of them I listen to, and for one woman's opinion, this show ranks as my top personal favorite, and is something I look forward to everyday of the week. Thanks Mark for the great show, and thanks to Stitcher for carrying it for listeners.
"
252,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"Mark Levin is a GIFT in the form of a radio talk show. His voice, intelligence, humor and love for country and all of God's creatures (dogs and conservatives in particular) is inspiring. I can't sleep until I listen to his podcast each evening which is usually available on Stitcher at about 10:30pm. I became practically addicted to his broadcast while living in NY and commuting home each evening to upper Westchester. When I moved from NYC to Cleveland the staff at the hotel I managed gave me a collectors edition of Liberty and Tyranny as my farewell gift....Could not have asked for a more appropriate gift. Stay well Mark and stay on the radio for many years to come. America needs you and we need to make sure millions more listen.
"
253,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"Levin's program is so much more than the typical talk radio show.  We've learned so much about our government, the sad reality of our total lack of leadership  (with a handful of exceptions), and how critical it is that we all get involved before the greatest experiment in government ""by the people"" is gone forever.  We live for the reruns the next day as we can't access him live.  We heartily encourage anyone who cares about the survival of our country to listen and learn.  
"
254,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"Mark Levin is, in my opinion, the number one, leading Constitutional mind in America. He should be President of the United States, but he'll probably never run! His command of the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, The Federalist Papers and the thought processes of the Founding Fathers and Founding Principles is second to none. The Mark Levin Show is smart, entertaining, enlightening and the first show I listen to every day. Mark Levin is my hero. He should be yours, too.
"
255,Mark Levin Podcast,5,"Mark has a lot to say and he should reach out beyond his radio show and podcast. On that point, I could not help notice while others charge a fee to stream their podcasts, Mark offers his full show for free. He needs advocates in the mainstream media to help promote his ideas and help get his message out. He hosts this show by himself and the average person may never hear it or may change the channel because his observations are so heavy, people prefer not to contemplate them.
"
256,Hidden Brain,5,"Shankar Vedantam consistently finds some of the most interesting social science research around and brings it to life on NPR, and now on his new podcast. As a Social Psychologist, I'm thrilled that he's not only bringing my field's research to a curious audience, but that he's doing it responsibly, without resorting to making sensational claims based on flimsy data -- his stories are always thoughtful and well researched.
"
257,Hidden Brain,5,"Love this show, it's so funny, so informative and very well written and delivered. Having said that, some episodes are a bit boring, but don't be disappointed by it! most are wonderful and funny
"
258,Hidden Brain,5,"I love the faceted perspectives and research this show always brings to the table. I'm always referring to it in conversation. The content is broken down in a way that makes sense to laymen like me. Always thoughtful. Always informative. Always approachable
"
259,Hidden Brain,5,"This show is always great. It consistently impresses me and makes me dig down deeper to actually think about things.
"
260,Hidden Brain,5,"I often find myself sharing Hidden Brain episodes on social media and I feel like I'm consistently using the word, ""fascinating"" to describe an episode! It's true though, there's a lot of great content on human behavior and the mind. Super interesting and one of my regulars.
"
261,Hidden Brain,5,"This show never disappoints! I love the variety and insight and cannot wait for new episodes to listen to, especially when I am at the gym working out--getting in shape and expanding my brain! What's not to love???
"
262,Hidden Brain,5,"Every day of the week I select a podcast to listen to as I go through my 1-hour long morning routine, and this one is my Monday Podcast, there's always something fascinating to learn, thank you Shankar and team!
"
263,Hidden Brain,5,"I turned my radio up every time Shankar came on- so smart, interesting, charming, and informative! I was thrilled to start listening to his show. Only wish it was longer!
"
264,Six Minutes,5,"I've been looking for something for my kids to listen to for a while and stumbled across six minutes. It's been really engaging and the kids are loving it. I appreciate the fact that it respects the intelligence of the listener and doesn't spoon-feed everything. It's well acted and the story line has wonderful twists and turns.
"
265,Six Minutes,5,"I""ve heard! So good for children ages 10 and up! Highly recommended!

266,Six Minutes,5,"i love this podcast best podcast ever amasing for kids

272,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,4,"Bill Nye is a national treasure! I grew up watching ""Bill Nye the Science Guy"". He helped nurture my budding love of science by explaining it in fun entertaining ways. Now I play these episodes for my children and students.This show does the exact same thing except for an older audience. I listen regularly.
Thank you for having Levar Burton on your most recent episode. I was also a huge fan of ""Reading Rainbow"". Now that I know he has a podcast for adults I am listening to that as well.
After 20+ years Bill Nye still encourages me to be curious about the world, question everything and learn new things everyday. I cannot fully state how pleased I am with this show. Science rules!
"
273,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,3,"I started listening, because I read ""Everything All At Once"". Since, in my opinion, this is the best book of the year, I needed to get more of Bill Nye's information. Yes, I'm a Nerd wannabe (I just don't quite have what Bill Nye has--he is a super Nerd). Many times, I'd like to ask a question, but the timing is all off. So, here is my question: How do you interact with people who not only aren't informed about climate change, for example, but have no interest in changing their tune and no interest in learning anything more than they learned since high school 20 years ago?
"
274,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,5,"Two knowledgeable and funny hosts chatting with experts in their respective fields about interesting topics that we the listeners want to learn more about AND a chance to talk with them ourselves? What more could you ask for?! Love the show, love the format, cannot wait to hear more!
"
275,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,5,"Thank you Bill Nye for making science cool! Well, it was cool all along, but it's good to keep reminding people.
"
276,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,5,"So, my husband and I grew up watching ""Bill Nye the Science Guy,"" which we have introduced to our kids, now ages 9 and 6. When we heard there was going to be a podcast, we were ECSTATIC! We like listening to educational/science podcasts with our kids during the before-school routine, or on long car rides. This morning, I put on the first episode, and although the content and subject matter were 100% appropriate and intellectually accessible to my kids, I was a little disappointed at some of the language. Look, I'm no prude, and I've been known to let a few curse words slip in front of my children, but I wish this podcast could be edited a bit for ""age-appropriate language,"" so that it's more accessible to all ages. I really want my kids to be able to enjoy this podcast with us. Thanks for hearing me out!

277,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,5,"I enjoy your show, but find some of the speaking habits of the guests to be irritating with ""like"" sprinkled in several times a sentence. Heredity and Me was a great topic, but between the first interviewee and her Dad.....
I was like, yannow, they say, like, like too much. Like, I mean, like, when trying to make, like, a point, and they need a, like, moment to, like, think.....
Sorry....I tried to stay with it, but it was an irritant to the point of a tune-out.
You are obviously educated, well-spoken, and broadcast experienced, and I realize you have to deal with what you get for guests. Perhaps, ""like"", a gentle request to them before the recording?
Thanks for what you do, though.
"
278,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,4,"I grew up with science guy and always have loved science as a whole. Thank you so much to returning to the scene with this podcast . I love hearing from the experts in the matter and love the little comedy twists in it to keep it refreshing. It is never dull and I like the fact that outsiders can type/call in get everyday questions answered rather than it just being the usual drone. Keep it up I look forward to it every week!
"
279,Science Rules! with Bill Nye,3,"Carbon Capture podcast. If Science Rules, then you and Dr. Chichilnisky know that science tells us the current global warming started 15,000 years ago before humans could contribute to it. Yes humans are now contributing to it. If Science Rules, then science tells us that humans can't reverse climate change. Science tells us that climate change is a natural cycle between a hot planet and a cold planet and that the cycle has happened many times in the past and will continue into the future.

280,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,5,"Everything about this podcast about a fairly recent tragedy is inappropriate. not to mention the constant repeating, creepy music, sensationalism. I used to be a great fan of Dr. Phil when he first knew Oprah. Either I have changed, or he has, or both--but I find myself thinking he is more about opinions than knowledge. The FB aspect of this tragedy needs to be considered. I was hoping, as a psychologist, he would go into that. I won't be able to sit through this to find out. Dr. Phil is embarrassingly shameless here. Please get over yourself, be considerate, Dr. Phil.
"
281,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,1,"Great show. I love crime shows and enjoyed Dr Phil's analysis. I especially love the tragic story of Gypsy Rose. Though I learned a great deal about her during the 5 episodes, I was annoyed by the repetition in the entire series. Each episode was almost 90 min when it really had only 20 min-30 min of good quality content. The rest was Dr. Phil telling me how she fell in love with a 500 year old vampire, Victor. I loved it other
"
282,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,1,"I completely love this podcast! BUT the music in the background is horrible! Maybe its because I listen to it on computer speakers, but sometimes its so loud I can't even hear Dr. Phil. There is one point where it gets so strong that it's like nails on a chalk board and I have to skip over it. please consider different music so I can continue to enjoy the show!
"
283,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,3,"I love this podcast! I've only heard the first episode so far but I am already hooked. I love Dr. Phil's voice and he is a great story teller. Will definitely be listening every week!
"
284,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,4,"Dr. Phil has knocked it out of the park with this podcast! He's bringing us Gypsy Rose's story in a way no one else has done yet, while also revealing facts that we haven't heard before. I like that he's including interviews with Gypsy's father & step-mother and I hope that there are others interviewed as well. Thank you Dr. Phil!
"
285,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,5,"Sounds like he's telling some creepy bedtime story that is wildly inappropriate. Very over the top for no reason.
"
286,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,5,"Too much repetition and long winded. The first 5 episodes about Gypsie Rose could be condensed into 2 maybe 3 episodes.
"
287,A Mother’s Secret: The Lori Vallow ...,1,"As a previous listener commented, way over the top and dramatic for no reason. I couldn't even listen to the whole thing.
"
288,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"Bill's soft and angelic voice perfectly disguises his Boston roots. I never thought a SeatGeek or Dunkin Donuts promotion could literally bring me to tears and force me to reevaluate our place in the cosmos. I'm fairly certain Bill's voice has the same frequency as those of most whales and certain dolphin species. How can anyone disagree with a man whose voice can bring peace to the Middle East for centuries? Oh, and don't get me started on his praise of Porziggy, I'm getting giddy already. 5/5, would recommend.
"
289,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"Bill - Huge fan for many years but you completely missed the boat on the Dido song White Flag. The lyrics are the effectively the EXACT OPPOSITE. Plus she does End of Night or See You when You're Forty which would both win..
"
290,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"I want Bill and Sal to literally do an entire pod as Mike and the Mad dog. Great podcast, would recommend to anybody
""Turn my mic on!!!""
"
291,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"Simmons, I've listened to every podcast. In my humble opinion, today's cast with Katie Nolan was the best. I was cracking up at work listening to you talk about kids and daughters in 5th grade. I have a 1yr old boy and was already taking notes. The conversation flow was great. Bring her back as much as possible!! Keep up the good work!
"
292,The Bill Simmons Podcast,1,"Used to be my favorite podcast, but way way too much just saying what he thinks and that everyone else or any other opinion is stupid, way to much favoritism and boston talk as always but its been getting worse. Too many making jokes about stupid things and not actually talking about sports. Also really didnt understand staying out of politics except to take random shots at Bernie Sanders, guess someone does not want his taxes to go up.
"
293,The Bill Simmons Podcast,4,"Bill is great at this and continues what he started years ago with great guests and topics I am interested in. BUT he needs to turn off his phone. I was listening to the most recent podcast and he almost made it, but with less than 10 minutes to go sure enough his phone rang not 1 but 2 times. Comes across as unprofessional.
"
294,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"If one sign of a great television show are spinoffs (Mary Tyler Moore, All In the Family, Cheers, Seinfeld, Breaking Bad) then House of Carbs, Against All Odds and GM Street are further proof of the mastery of the Podfather himself.
"
295,The Bill Simmons Podcast,5,"Bill's interviews always feel honest and on point. It's not forced, and the listener can imagine being in the same room and just casually listening to a conversation between friends. This is what all podcasts should strive to be.
"
296,You're Wrong About,5,"I'm a gen Z 18 year old too young to know much about anything they talk about and yet it's still such a pleasure to be there for these engrossing stories about real people. Their ability to zero in on cultural issues, to refuse to accept the narrative they have been given and the depth of their compassion for victims and perpetrators alike will anew your faith in what the future holds. Media personnel from around the world could do with a look at these two wonderful human beings; they've convinced a media wary teen that the media may have an important place in our world yet, if only they were all like Michael and Sarah!
"
297,You're Wrong About,1,"I love Sarah and Mike's banter, I love the topics they choose, I love the format of the show. I also think folks who enjoy On the Media will love this show because Sarah and Mike talk a lot about how the media coverage of these events/phenomena/etc. that we're wrong about affects the cultural memory (and, thus, our own wrongness). It's fascinating because where On the Media keeps up with present-day media, Sarah and Mike talk about how media in the past has affected these culturally misrememberings/misunderstandings, and because, of course, the past affects the present (and we can occasionally learn from it if we're lucky), it's fascinating to think of things on this show when considering present media.
"
298,You're Wrong About,5,"You probably don't remember the weird stuff from your childhood accurately. Mike and Sarah will help you sort it out. And they don't interrupt each other or say ""Um...""! Just a good investigation of some of the more unusual parts of American culture.
"
299,You're Wrong About,5,"Stuff you probably forgot even happened, and will enjoy having dissected by people who really know what they're talking about.
"
300,You're Wrong About,5,"This is one of my new favorites. I like the topics, the hosts, and the flow of the conversation. I will say, though, Sarah has a REAL issue with ""white men"" and I feel like she finds a way to take a shot at them every episode. It gets really tiring, and this is coming a non-white guy lol. Also, she sometimes laughs at inappropriate times about inappropriate topics. I don't know if it is nervousness or what, but I find it disturbing. If not for those issues with Sarah, it would be 5 Star. But I do enjoy the show and will be listening into the future.
"
301,You're Wrong About,5,"Awesome podcast! Great research and fun commentary, with great chemistry between the two hosts. Even when I'm unsure about a topic (I'm European and the topics naturally relate strongly to American experiences, so sometimes I think ""uhh, that doesn't sound that interesting""), I listen anyway and am always engrossed and fascinated.
"
302,You're Wrong About,4,"I only listened to the human trafficking episode, but it was incredibly frustrating how simplistic their understanding of trafficking was. A lot of their information was just flat-out wrong, and they spent most of their time talking about the sensationalized, incorrect media portrayal of ""trafficking"" and moral panic, without actually talking about the very real issue of trafficking in the world today. It would have been a really good episode to bring in a specialist. I can't help but find the name of their podcast incredibly ironic.
"
303,You're Wrong About,5,"Agree with a previous commenter that their understanding of the overall issue around human trafficking is highly simplistic and unfortunately very scattered. I've worked in the industry to stop child abuse for 15 years and I've been listening to this podcast for a year. Some points were valid, but overall they seem to be confused about how the human trafficking/child abuse circles work. This was the most disappointing episode and wish there was more clarity around the point they were making.
Really like the DC Sniper and OJ cases! Great podcast overall.
"
304,99% Invisible,4,"99% Invisible takes you to interesting topics and explores them in interesting ways. It's a show about design. They talk about the design of not just the look of things, but also the function, impact, and more. Every now and then the show takes on a topic that is less interesting to me, but overall, I find it worth listening to every week.
This show is professionally produced in an NPR program style (not a discussion style). They clearly put a ton of work into it to bring on site interviews and sound that you can only get by putting your heart and soul into the project. Give it a try. You wont be disappointed.
"
305,99% Invisible,5,"I love listening to this show. Most episodes are on obscure and fascinating topics that I probably would not have learned about otherwise. I get excited for each new episode that comes out! I have high hopes for the future of this show, and recommend it highly to those of my friends who enjoy learning about weird topics, such as the hidden staircases-to-nowhere throughout California, or the story behind the ""I <3 New York"" slogan. :)
"
306,99% Invisible,5,"Absolutely fascinating. Profoundly well done.
The first episode I heard was about the Chicago river flowing backwards and I was immediately hooked. Roman and team somehow manage to produce brilliance time and time again. I've taken to listening while running, and every new episode makes for some pretty unbeatable motivation!
"
307,99% Invisible,2,"Some of the episodes are really really interesting. Unfortunately, a large portion of them are now becoming increasingly political and have begun milking the identity politics teet for ratings. It's garbage content. If you're exhausted by the continued political polarity that's invading every sector of media like a malignant cancerous tumor, then you probably won't last all that long with 99% Invisible. It's a shame, because some of the content is genuinely interesting!
"
308,99% Invisible,4,"This show has a variety of great episodes on topics I would have never heard about otherwise. It really is a very interesting show. However the length of the shows is kind of on the short side and a large part of 15-20 minute episodes consists of ads and credits.
"
309,99% Invisible,5,"Long time listener - but only just now realized how to leave a review! The interesting topics is what drew me in but Roman's soothing voice kept me coming back! Such great topics that you never really hear about. Its always fun to share the little tidbits of information with others. I could only wish the podcasts were longer but fully understand the topics aren't meant to be much longer! Love this podcast
"
310,99% Invisible,5,"This show is an absolute joy. It always exposes something that I didn't know existed or was right in front of me but I didn't see it.
I find I also enjoy trying to guess what the show is about during the lead in. ""Is it really about houses or is he going to take a turn into the materials that make them"" and that sort of thing roams around in my head before getting to the big wow moment of the show.
"
311,99% Invisible,5,"I don't think I've had a conversation in the past year where some episode of 99PI wasn't relevant. I recommend it to maybe too many people. I love it so much and it has so much relevance to every single person's life. Not to mention the fact that Roman Mars has a kickass voice (to go along with his and his kids' kickass names). I simply can't say enough good things about this show.
"
312,Morning Joe,5,"I so very much enjoy this one. It doesn't require video to enjoy, making it on top of my podcast list for the workday. It's difficult to a find a political podcast which isn't solo or a duet.These guys have shown that people can have journalistic integrity, news based of facts and still making news and politics exciting and enjoyable.There are enough monotone shows out there. Put out the whole show though, few people will stay with cable for one show. I haven't had cable in 8 years and have been thrilled with it until I found Morning Joe. I can't go back to cable but I would pay for full audio episodes.
"
313,Morning Joe,2,"I love your show, but can you please make it the WHOLE show? I have to listen to it via Stitcher while at work since I leave too early to watch it at home. I'm missing out!! Please can you lengthen the broadcast? It would be a great Christmas present....
"
314,Morning Joe,5,"What will it take to air all 3 hours on stitcher? Multi gabagillion dollar company? It's possible. Make it happen.
"
315,Morning Joe,5,"I do not understand why MSNBC cannot put a better team in a premier morning spot. Do Joe and Mika ever do any show prep? It sounds (I occasionally listen to the podcast) like they just wing it, with Joe overreaching to be southern folksy and a loveable goofball to Mika reading news copy as if she is encountering written English for the first time. The panel is OK when they allowed to expound by the over-talking Joe. Who is the sound editor? All the snorting, coughing, and sniffing is very off-putting. And, despite the vicious anti-Trump tenor of the show lately, we do remember that Mika and Joe launched Trump's candidacy with daily fawning ""interviews"".
"
316,Morning Joe,2,"It's on way too early to watch in the far west so I listen to it on stitcher every afternoon.  I wish they would quit the bicker and silly stuff. I'm here to hear the news and interviews,  I don't need the sports or banter.  I wish the show was longer.  I also do not know why it is not available every day.  
"
317,Morning Joe,1,"I live on the West Coast....so do not get up to hear the show as it is broadcast....3:00 AM....sooooo...I listen to the Stitcher broadcast....Please lengthen the broadcast!!!  Twenty to thirty minutes is just not lone enough!!!!  Thank you!!!!
"
318,Morning Joe,4,"I discovered this show on Stitcher, and had never heard of it before. It is a true gem. The hosts provide a good balance of opinion so you are never quite sure if the show leans more toward the left or the right. Much more fun than Wall Street Journal This Morning. 
"
319,Morning Joe,5,"I love this show. I really enjoy Joe and Mika's interactions. I turn here to get more than one side for takes on current affairs. I just wish they still had the video cast, but glad they had an audio version. I don't live in the states and like to keep up with American News.
"
320,Cum Town,5,"An absolutely marvellous podcast my dear friends.
This show is full to the brim with wit, satire and insight.
"
321,Cum Town,5,"As soon as I started listening to this show. It was like my lower body completely lost control and I started convulsing on the ground. Highly recommended!
"
322,Cum Town,5,"Three bonafide stallions discuss news, sports, and the weather.
"
323,Cum Town,5,"the dynamic of a jewish south african gay man,morbidly obese greek man and an aspergers ridden celibate creates a very unique atmosphere that is most importantly not funny at all.
"
324,Cum Town,4,"I love that listening to this show isnt like a task. They talk about the most offensive things in the most hilarious ways and i love that! I do hate though that the individual voice volumes are sooooo off. I'll listen to it while I work and i will have to crank the volume for one convo, and then someone who is leaning into the mic,says something and pretty near blasts my eardrums out. The content is amazing the sound is terrible. Love you guyss!!!<3
"
325,Cum Town,1,"Idiots laughing at their own belching and bad jokes.
"
326,Cum Town,5,"Lots of come to enjoy. Good times. come sad leave happy.
"
327,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,2,"Why hasn't Ali been on the podcast? I enjoy listening to her over Rachel, I get it Rachel is opinionated but she comes across as rude and snarky a lot.
"
328,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"Love Rachel interviewing skills, hope you get a good co host to balance it out. I look forward to listening every week, also I love that you're one of the few in BN that does speak her mind and is a straight shooter
"
329,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,1,"Poor interviews, interrupting, constant interjection of hosts experience. Listenerd want to hear from guests, not hosts. One star for Rachel and some good questions. Otherwise a waste of time.
"
330,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"I loved listening to the show today. It was a pleasure celebrating Rachel & Bryan affectionately known as RnB upcoming nuptials. Rachel & Ali were on point with Tayshia's interview. Keep up the good work ladies.
"
331,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"I love this podcast! Rachel is amazing and Joe Amabile would be an awesome addition. I really loved listening to him on the podcast :)
"
332,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"One of my favorites to listen to! Rachel keep those tough questions coming lol. We are all thinking what you are asking lol.
"
333,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"I love this show. I wish it was daily or, at least, twice per week. The last episode need more than an hour to discuss.
"
334,Bachelor Happy Hour – The Official ...,5,"I love the new podcast!! It's in my favorites! I will be listening!
"
335,The Ezra Klein Show,4,"I enjoy listening to your podcast. However, your site makes it difficult to find your advertisers, contact you, or give suggestions. I listen to your podcast and may find something interesting, but plan to follow later. However, your website does not contain a link to contact advertisers or maybe how to find more information on your most recent podcast. I am an over sixty listener so my internet skills may not be very current. For example, if I can't remember your advertiser after listening to the podcast while walking early in the morning, then there is no contact/refresher information on your web site that I can find. How about a ""contact Ezra"" link?
"
336,The Ezra Klein Show,1,"I listen to podcasts while riding my bike every morning in the French Alps. Sometimes, I find one so stimulating that I forget the scenery as I get completely absorbed in a GREAT discussion. What I liked about it particularly was that while allowing her persona to come through, it was also wonderfully informative about what the true spirit of a reporter should be; how to be a better writer/reporter; what it is like to work in the industry and how it's evolving; and what's happening in Silicon Valley and business in general. It really got me to think. This is one of the best podcast I've heard and I have been addicted to them for 10 years.
"
337,The Ezra Klein Show,4,"Ezra is really a great interviewer. He doesn't just ask questions of the guest. He truly engages in a conversation so that the dialogue goes way beyond just question and answer, and new insights are created by the discussion. I think he might be about the best I've heard on podcasts. I was surprised by this because his mien is so calm and neutral, but his conversation with Rebecca Traister had me writing down some of the insights they came up with together.
"
338,The Ezra Klein Show,5,"These podcasts are pound for pound the most information you can ingest to get a sense of particular person or subject.
"
339,The Ezra Klein Show,5,"Patrick Collison mentions interesting people, blogs, articles, books, etc. etc. etc. There is no way to follow these up. One needs a written reference list or a transcript.
"
340,The Ezra Klein Show,5,"In this podcast Ezra Klein does an absolutely amazing job probing really interesting people I sort of wish I had the opportunity to meet. I love how it goes between the formal and the mundane. The follow up questions always give depth that in many other formats are not addressed. Thanks!
"
341,The Ezra Klein Show,5,"This show is so in-depth it might be the closest thing in politics to expressing the experiences of people of interest, those who either bring news, channel politics or have moved through the body politic.
"
342,The Ezra Klein Show,5,"Ezra seems to always swing to the Alt Left with horrifying speed. His complete lack of ability to self reflect/critique on any topic is horrifyingly similar to a religious belief. Hit technique of straw manning his opponents at virtually every corner is a poignant deflection when he can not use logic and facts to defend his claims. Sadly his Regressive social agenda gains traction among weak thinkers who need to be spoon feed a plate full of feelings before facts and social constructionism sprinkled with a healthy dose of Marxism.
"
343,You Must Remember This,4,"I am in love with this show. I'm currently driving across the country and I can listen to the episode after episode for hours on end. I just recently discovered it so I'm only up to Episode 27, but I've blasted through them in two days. I find Karina's voice, silly impressions, and ""join us, won't you?"" all to be completely charming - not annoying for me at all. Feels handmade, like a cool 'zine from a friend. Even when it's an episode about something I think I know about well - like Liz & Monty Clift - it is both entertaining and provides me with tons of new tidbits.
"
344,You Must Remember This,3,"One of the podcasts I most wish would come back with new episodes. The creator gives a cinematic retelling of iconic film actors, producers etc. in an effort to correct the historic record, which was often more colorful than accurate. If this sounds a little dry, it's not. Instead it's a wonderful retelling of stories you thought you knew, presented by someone who is a fine writer with great researching skills. There's a compelling, dreamy atmosphere which is the perfect background for the subject matter. If you love the films of Quentin Tarantino this is the podcast equivalent of his numerous homages to cinematic history, the real deal behind the myths.
"
345,You Must Remember This,5,"I keep listening to this show because it is well researched and tells really interesting stories. But man, I can only listen to one at a time because the narrator's vocal ticks really start grating. Pronouncing T's as D's (""forgodden"" histories, wridden by...), the voices she does when she's speaking in a character's voice (why?), and her Shatner-esque way of introducing the show (which she also slips into when emphasizing a really serious or important point). Also, the repeated ""Join us, won't you?"" is so, so annoying. It makes me cringe every time now.
But the fact that I keep listening in spite of all of this just goes to show how compelling the content is. So worth a listen if you can handle it.
"
346,You Must Remember This,5,"Every time I scroll down through the YMRT archives, I'm confronted with the first review on the list. A joyless reviewer (moniker: ""Bananahead"") describes this podcast's narration (or, rather, its narrator) as ""annoying,"" ""grating,"" something that causes a cringe.
You should disregard Bananahead's point of view. Yeah, there's some camp to the narration. It's not stressing the grave, sober angle at every single moment. Instead, it's lively without being intrusive. Accessible. Ear-catching. The narrator doesn't fall into that sometimes-nauseating, oddly self-aggrandizing ""prestige podcast"" cadence. And, look, if you dislike hearing someone mildly or comically alter their voice to indicate that they're quoting someone else, I have no idea how you have a conversation.
The content of this podcast is well-researched, well-organized, and well-presented. It's enthralling, and easy to get into even if you've never heard of the subjects of a particular episode. If old Hollywood itself, popular culture, gossip, or history interest you at all, I'd highly recommend you give at least one episode a shot.
"
347,You Must Remember This,4,"I love the subject matter and am pleased that more people have gotten interested in classic Hollywood. But Ms. Longworth is a terrible narrator. Her voice grates and her impersonations are painful to listen to. There are also mispronunciations on names and facts that are simply incorrect. Maybe writing, narrating and editing by one person isn't the best plan?
As much as I love the subject matter, I generally cannot get through entire episodes without frustration.
"
348,You Must Remember This,5,"Potentially interesting material, but I can't get past the narrator. My understanding is that she writes her own material? But her reading consistently suggests she's never looked at it--phrasing that doesn't look ahead to the next clause and woodenness, and a weird hyperarticulation that's thoroughly distracting. I tried a few episodes that looked promising but couldn't keep going past a few minutes on any of them.
"
349,You Must Remember This,3,"AS a hardcore Hollywood afficianado, I used to really like this podcast. But as time has gone on, the constant mispronunciations make me facepalm constantly. De-SEE-ko for Thelma Todd's ex-husband? Really? You've never known any Italians to ask for reference? Or Frank YABlans instead of Ya-BLONZ? With all the research that is done for the show, I'm assuming you spend some time at the Margaret Herrick or know other Hollywood fanatics. Any of the older librarians there or hardcore fans can give you tips on important names like these, instead of the massacre that occurs. And I'm with the others on the vocal tics. I'll second the D to T transition (Richard Burden instead of Richard Burton), and the overenunciated T's (instead of the D sound everyone else uses) are really annoying.
"
350,You Must Remember This,2,"The narrator does take some getting used to (other reviews are more specific/critical) but still compelling. If Longworth's topic interests you, you will find it hard to stop listening. Her writing is very good. I especially enjoyed the Charles Manson-Hollywood series and learned a lot about that gruesome case.
"
351,Bannon's War Room,5,"I've always had a rather disdain for political process, yet this podcast provides the education to be informed and prepared in a very insightful, intellectually honest (even while biased), and concise manner. No wasted platitudes, over the top hyperbole, or unnecessary chronic ad hominem. Learning about the process (while still abhoring it)? CHECK. Questioning my opinions and viewpoints? CHECK. Getting information not likely to be covered elsewhere or without a great deal of searching? CHECK. **big plus - Stitcher app on Alexa allows voice command control of podcasts**
"
352,Bannon's War Room,5,"The MSM is totally politicized and cannot be trusted to report truthfully. You have been a voice of reason and you have united the world. Thank God that we have you at this critical moment in human history. Your work is excellent. Pittsburgh is gearing up for the virus. UPMC, largest employer in the region, will pay for sick leave related to the COVID-19, whether or not home bound employees are able to work, and also cover expenses related to testing for COVID-19 for members of the Health Plan. Co-payments for Anywhere Care (telemedicine) waived for 90 days. University of Pittsburgh has been working on a vaccine for weeks.
"
353,Bannon's War Room,5,"Bannon is amazing and Jason Miller and Raheem complement him well. This is like listening to the behind the scenes conversations that are happening on Capitol Hill before it becomes public. I've learned a lot about communication strategy and how all these things that are happening around impeachment are interconnected. I listen everyday and feel prety informed about what is going on. Great job!
"
354,Bannon's War Room,5,"The War Room podcasts about the impeachment have become my daily addiction... always spot on, with critical analysis, up to date information and interesting guests. It doesn't get better than this!
"
355,Bannon's War Room,5,"So grateful for this overview and consolidation to see through what's really going on with this impeachment inquiry. The interviews & background information is riveting and helpful. I don't have time for all the dribble in news media, but THIS I have listened to every day, twice a day since it's inception and I say, RIGHT ON!
"
356,Bannon's War Room,5,"Thanks gentlemen much needed perspective. Especially liked Rudy G. Steve, I am a recovering Democrat. Your podcast compelling and essential. Keep it going.
"
357,Bannon's War Room,5,"guys. he content is the best anywhere.
but PLEASE get your audio levels sorted out.
the volume of the commercial breaks is WAAAY TOO loud compared to the actual show.
to the point i have to ride my volume control when listening.
in general the level of the show is too low. id say about 30% lower than other podcasts i listen to (mark levin, Hannity, Buck sexton) out of all these yours is the lowest.
the volume of the commercial breaks is plenty loud, then it is too quiet for the actual show.
maybe reverse these. or at least use some audio compression to even out the levels.
"
358,Bannon's War Room,5,"I don't live in DC, but this podcast takes me to the inside the body politic for free. Bannon, Miller and Kassam run a tight podcast exposing all the inside swamp details. Sticking mainly to the impeachment saga, but sometimes taking a ride into other issues keeps it fresh. Guests have so far added interesting dynamics. It's worth your time, OK Boomer?
"
359,Recode Decode,5,"I have never heard a host/interviewer interrupt or finish a guest's sentence more than this person. The guest was very interesting and I have heard him interviewed multiple times. I had to turn this interview off after about ten minutes as it was so off putting I lost all ability to concentrate on the guest and topic. I have never heard of Kara Swisher and only listened to this as the interview was linked from the guest's own web site. I decided to check out the Recode Decode web site and was not surprised to read so many similar comments. Ms Swisher, please bite your lip if you need to and let the guest speak.
"
360,Recode Decode,1,"Was excited to tune in to an interview with a guest that I assumed would be very interesting. Instead the host spent most of the podcast re-hashing tired questions the guest had been asked for years and years. Given the focus of the show on guests 'big ideas and how they're changing the world,' I would have expected a much less oppositional approach full of low-grade character assassination. It felt more like a politicized cable TV news interview, which is exactly the opposite of what I'd expect from a content/idea-focused podcast. I honestly almost never write negative reviews but doing so in this case feels warranted.
"
361,Recode Decode,1,"While I don't doubt Swisher's abilities as a journalist, her interviewing skills are abysmal. This is an awkward podcast. Guests' answers are trampled with a constant stream of know-it-all remarks and off-topic opinions. Fascinating stories are left stunted because no one can finish a sentence in the presence of this interviewer.
"
362,Recode Decode,2,"Great guests, some good questions, but no option for guests to actually answer and share their knowledge without being interrupted every. single. time.
"
363,Recode Decode,2,"I love Kara and agree with 99% of what she says about tech and culture but she needs to pay attention to how her feedback queues sound and how much she interrupts. We are listening because we want to hear the guest. Let them speak. As a woman it literally pains me to type this because men are usually the ones talking over women. Slow down and listen to your guests. I promise it won't hurt the repartee.
"
364,Recode Decode,1,"...is the worst interviewer I've ever heard. Way too many interruptions, limited knowledge, clearly trying to create soundbytes instead of achieving real understanding. Will be my last Recode podcast, and probably Elon's, too, if he had the experience I think he had.
"
365,Recode Decode,2,"Many reviews seemed bothered by Kara's strong presence- like she gets in the way? Problem is the interviewees seem to love her engagement, passion, and sincerity. The problem is some guests/businesses are just a little too much about jee wiz commerce or social media tech that is great way to make money and nothing else. I'm not against great tech ideas or making money, but Yuck. I will listen, and she is also better, when she has more to bite into than that. She is good even when the subject isn't, however I pass on such episodes. You rock Kara, and if you like this at all checking out PIVOT is a must.
"
366,Recode Decode,1,"The guests are brilliant, but the interviewer is so biased to her opinions and interrupt the guests way too much. Really wanted to listen to her guests, but unfortunately the interviewer won't allow me to.
"
367,"Today, Explained",4,"I've been listening to this podcast nearly daily for 3 months now. I enjoy that they pick a story and dwell into it. At first I wanted to give it rave reviews but then I stopped to consider how I'm reviewing it. I just looked through the list of the episodes that I listened to and many of them are pretty neutral when it comes to politics. However, when it comes to more politically charged stories, I have to agree that they are a bit biased to one side. If this was a story telling program, it would be less of an issue but since the claim of the podcast is news, I would definitely like it if both sides were presented better.
"
368,"Today, Explained",1,"I think this show is great, and I have listened to every episode, however today's episode, ""What can the president do during a national emergency"" left me feeling a bit off. Intimating that Trump may shut down the internet or send the military to quell peaceful protests seemed irrational and unnecessary. Exchange the word ""Trump"" with ""Obama"", and I could have believed I was listening to a piece on Fox News from five years ago. I appreciate how the show takes a realistic and fact-based look at a news item every day; let's leave the conjecture to lesser pundits. Thank you!
"
369,"Today, Explained",4,"Sean Rameswaram and the team behind Today, Explained have a very difficult job in maintaining the production standards and release schedule that they do, and they do it incredibly well. The topics are relevant and well-chosen, and the level of context provided is super helpful. The show works well at many different levels of gravity, deploying at turns levity and respect for people who have suffered or done heroic things, and the audio production tracks well with the tone and complements it. Definitely the best audio production and music of any Vox podcast.
"
370,"Today, Explained",4,"I really enjoy this show for the most part. Sawn is a very engaging host and gets very knowledgable guests to explain things. I'd highly recommend it.
I prefer when its straight forward explaining a lot more than when its silly with songs or cheese... I didn't make it through the Dial C for Cohen... to cheesy.
Also a very high commercial to podcast ratio.
But I really do enjoy it.
"
371,"Today, Explained",5,"I consider myself an open person when it comes to hearing both sides of a debate/discussion, but it is extremely frustrating to hear topics and headlines being skewed or framed in a misleading way. I do lots of research from sources across the political spectrum to form an opinion and can say with 100% confidence that this podcast takes worldwide issues (many of them very complicated) and puts a left wing spin on it. But if you have many far left wing views, then this is a podcast for you. I will however compliment the host on his openness to conversation, unlike many on the far left.
"
372,"Today, Explained",4,"I'm not from the US but I love Vox and listen to this everyday, it makes news interesting. Although, in saying this, the most recent episodes, particularly ""Thanks, Obama"", seemed a bit off to me with the long pauses after the host's ""dad jokes"".
I feel that the pauses go on for a bit longer than needed in a way that it's obvious they're trying to be funny and so makes it awkward and not funny. I'm not a big fan of the parody music or the music choices neither and often skip these, but the rest of the podcast is awesome, very interesting reporting laid out in an understandable way.
"
373,"Today, Explained",1,"Interesting and fun to listen to while at work. One of my favorites~
"
374,"Today, Explained",4,"I appreciate how Today Explained gives me a short but detailed summary of the most important headlines. I appreciate how the host always brings an expert on the show to weigh in and provide further context. Staying on top of the news can be intimidating sometimes and other daily news podcasts can be overly complex or lean too much into info-tainment. I think Today Explained has a good balance and it certainly has a spot on my morning commute playlist.
"
375,NPR News Now,5,"There is an advantage to a news organization raising all its money from listeners and a small percentage from the government: They are not beholden to shareholders -- or sensationalism. In an age when it's easier to learn who made Kim Kardashian's dress than discover which Senators rejected a VA funding bill, NPR stands above the rest for its reporting. Even 4 minutes of listening to headlines and important events in the U.S. and around the globe tells listeners what really matters without the noise of every other network. They also take pains to dodge the he-said-she-said model of reporting so popular on today's cable networks. Listen in!
"
376,NPR News Now,5,"NPR Hourly News is the most reliable way to keep up with the day's top stories. NPR is one of the last & best unbiased newscasts not beholding to corporate agendas & advertisers. As Walter Cronkite described it was his job to do, NPR & NPR: Hourly does the same by, ""delivering the facts on the news you Need To Know & Not the news based on what They Think you Want To Hear."" Another reason NPR News & NPR: Hourly News is your bes tnews source is that NPR stands for more than, ""National Public Radio.""NPR also means, ""No (political) Party Radio! Go on & try them out! Listen to NPR: Hourly for a week. I'm sure you'll agree.
"
377,NPR News Now,4,"I rank NPR second only to the New York Times (NYT) as a source that helps me track what is on American culture's news agenda. Having said that, I prefer NPR to the NYT. I listen to the hourly newscast one to three times a day to stay informed. International coverage is adequate but not thorough, as one expects from Americans.
"
378,NPR News Now,5,"When I think of fast and relevant news I think of NPR hourly newscast. I don't have time to read for 30 minutes about everything that is happening. But I do have time for a quick summary of all the most important news of the day! Thanks NPR. 
"
379,NPR News Now,5,"Their demeanor, their objective presentation of the context. True professionalism. Even if they present information that may have already been publicized, they font sensationalize. You know it's not a loud parade when they publicize the news but they do it in a way that doesn't neglect the importance or pertinence of an article. When you listen to NPR news, or any other podcasts NPR has (SNAPJUDGEMENT is also incredibly good), you're not being short changed, and you're entering some loud noisey circus act when listening to NPR. It's always sobering hearing NPR. Highly recommend it if you're not already aware of what they offer. (Best of the Left is great too if you like a collection of articles curated to cover a meta theme in liberal news)
"
380,NPR News Now,4,"Love all the different stories, unfortunately without the volume being modulated for the different reports one has to continually adjust the volume on the I phone.  This becomes annoying to take the phone out of the sport holster each time for each report in order to adjust the volume.
"
381,NPR News Now,4,"I have three brief newscasts from difference outlets programmed to play one after the other. The NPR newscasts seem surprisingly well-balanced politically, considering their source. Perhaps they could stand a little more emphasis on domestic news as opposed to international.
"
382,NPR News Now,5,"Great way for me to hear US and National news quickly!
"
383,Unlocking Us with Brené Brown,5,"So happy you have started this long overdue podcast! Thank you for giving FFTs a name and a face. Your examples were awesome and the strategies very useful. BTW, your outro was great.
"
384,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"I love this show and listen to it every week. The people interviewed are so inspiring and interesting. I strongly felt the need to comment on Chris Zarou's comments about trying to find an internship to gain managerial experience. My daughter did a 6 month internship with Sony in college and part of her duties was to scan social media for ""up and coming"" artists. She ""found"" Imagine Dragons and wrote up the proposal to her boss and was laughed out of the room as a little girly without a clue how the big bad men ran things. I don't believe that gentleman is laughing now. So Chris probably did the best possible thing and deserves his success!!
"
385,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"These are riveting stories of people from startlingly diverse backgrounds whose energy, ideas, persistence and... often...humor has vaulted them to extreme success in businesses that matter deeply to them. It's a revelation that the world of business can be entertaining, emotional, and inspirational.
"
386,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"I love this podcast so much. Besides being entertaining and inspirational, each podcast makes me feel energized to believe that I Can Do It, too! Thank you, Guy. I adore you and your show. Maybe one day you'll be interviewing me:)
"
387,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"I listen to every episode and can't wait for the next one!
"
388,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"Guy Raz is such a great probing empathetic interesting Interviewer. Some times I laugh my like crazy sometimes I cry its so motivational and inspirational . Guy keep up the great talks and conversations with your guests. I truly enjoy this podcast. Thanks for the gems. Artie
"
389,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"It is so interesting to know the back story behind these great entrepreneurs and the tipping points and struggles to becoming a great success. I use so many of these products and services and knowing its origins gives me a great perspective and added respect for the Founders. I am hooked on this show and look forward to future broadcasts! Highly recommended! One of the best podcasts around!
"
390,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"Hearing the story of how well-known brands came to exist, in the words of the people who created them, is fascinating and inspiring. This is one of my favorite podcasts!
"
391,How I Built This with Guy Raz,5,"A highly addictive business podcast that gives entrepreneurs the inside track of what it really takes to build the businesses that are changing our world
"
392,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"I grew up on LeVar Burton teaching me to love the written word on Reading Rainbow. Now that he has a podcast reading short fiction for adults to enjoy, I am more than excited to see what else he has in store. LeVar Burton's reading of ""Kin"" by Bruce McAllister was engaging, entertaining, enjoyable, and a wonderful way to spend the night. It's as if LeVar is reading you a bedtime story, bringing a sense of calm and relaxation to anyone listening. It reminds me of when he used to read to us on Reading Rainbow. I loved this first episode and I am more than excited to listen to future installments of his podcast. It's going to be an amazing ride!
"
393,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"Every childhood afternoon of my memories comes back to me in a wholly new and yet familiar way, merging what LeVar brought me with storytelling in Reading Rainbow and this burning passion for stories that mark the world and those that listen to them with their own patterns and magicks, stirring new and exciting worlds to life in our veins--changing us, growing us into what we may yet become. Thank you for giving us a storytime to come to--whether we're old listeners or new, young or old--that continues to expand the horizons of our minds, and bring us to that collective fireplace, that cliffside edge, that ship in the sky. I can't wait to hear all the stories to come!
"
394,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"I grew up with LeVar reading to me on Reading Rainbow and hearing him read amazing short stories is probably the most soothing thing I can think of when I am ready to lose it on my way to work. This podcast is a lifesaver! LeVar suggested I leave story recommendations in one episode and I don't have an Apple login, so I will do it here. Two stories that are classics and I would love to hear read by him are ""The Lottery"" by Shirley Jackson, and ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" by Ambrose Bierce. I love these stories, but they are both more than a little dark, so I understand if they won't be top picks. Thanks a lot LeVar! Looking forward to more!
"
395,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"In the past 2 years, I’ve gotten into podcasts in a big way - I listen to a lot of shows while running, cleaning house, and commuting to work. So when I saw LeVar Burton had a new podcast that is essentially “Reading Rainbow” for adults, I was thrilled, and the result certainly hasn’t disappointed – it’s currently my favorite podcast! It’s absolutely perfect – LeVar’s smooth-as-silk, expressive vocals; fascinating, hand-picked short stories; and personal commentary make for such an enjoyable listening experience. For every grown-up who still wants to be read a good story, your wish has been granted. I hope LeVar keeps making many, many more episodes for all of us to enjoy.
"
396,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"I adore this podcast. Thank you LeVar for sharing these stories and by bringing them to life with your narration. I was a huge fan of Reading Rainbow as a child and I feel great nostalgia while listening to LeVar Burton Reads. I am often backed into a corner with work with not much time to myself; listening to an episode during my commute, during my breaks, or in between classes is a relaxing and worthwhile use of my time. I love that I recognize some of these authors and that I am being exposed to new authors and new works! Thank you to everyone who helped create this podcast project. I can't get enough of it and I am looking forward to more story recommendations. :)
"
397,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"I really value this podcast! LeVar Burton has a wonderful relaxing way of reading these stories. I also appreciate the way he brings these stories to life through the emotion he puts in it and through the voice he gives these characters. The tones and inflections in each story are also artfully handled, which is something so many other story podcasts seem to lack. Want short stories that actually sound interesting to listen to? This is the podcast to go to! I would really love to hear ""Recitatif"" read on the show. An interesting read about race relations that I cannot seem to wrap my brain around! Anywhoo, I hope there are many many more seasons of this podcast to come.
"
398,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"This podcast makes me so happy! I'm always looking for new authors to read and it does not disappoint, and of course Levar Burton's readings are unparalleled. I also appreciate the subtle music scoring and the live interviews with some of the authors as bonus content. I couldn't find a story suggestion option on the podcast website but I'd love to hear ""A Stretch of Highway Two Lanes Wide"" by Sarah Pinsker, or really anything from her collection Sooner or Later Everything Falls Into the Sea, her stories are fantastic and seem right up this podcast's alley. Thank you so much for taking the time to create this!
"
399,LeVar Burton Reads,5,"This was engaging, compelling, and truly enjoyable. Great way to spend my commute this morning. LeVar's reading was as amazing as expected, and this first story was excellent. Highly recommended!
"
400,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"I didn't think I would like it so much, but I think Marc Maron is one of the best interviewers around. He connects with his guests without pretense, and his own honesty and warmth seem to disarm them - which leads to a great conversation about meaningful and interesting aspects of people's lives. Of course my favorite interviews are with people I already know and admire, but I am surprised again and again at how much I enjoy and learn from interviews with people I'd never given much thought to, or maybe never even heard of. I ended up binge-watching the whole first season of Maron, and will no doubt do the same with the second. He is a mensch.
"
401,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"Marc doesn't mince words, he wears his heart uncomfortably on his sleeve, he's the real deal (the Kinison years), his love life mirrors mine. ""wtf is wrong with me??????"" The first podcast I truly heard him when he was on vacation in Hawaii, he was talking about his GF at the time, she eventually became his fiance, but inevitably broke up. My point is, the wriiting was on the wall , he knew it, but he went ahead with the relationship he knew was doomed anyway. This dude is my doppelganger in life. God bless him for letting me know I'm not too effed up, and inspite of idiosyncratic personalities, we can exisist is this world.
"
402,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"A few years have passed since I first got into Marc Maron's WTF podcast. If I remember correctly, I started listening around episode 5. Now almost 400 episodes later, I can attest that it's the same old show I fell in love with. Maron's ability to continuously produce interesting and intriguing content through his personal reflections and the interviews with guests allows for an amazing and feel-good show. I can't stress enough how many times I started a WTF pod episode in a funk and came out of it laughing. Maron is a Pod God. Get into his podcast, read his book, watch his show. 
"
403,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"This show is an incredibly comforting hang out session with this old friend who only ever talks about his personal interior universe, which is comfortable because it never changes, but then seeing how he interacts with each individual guest is amazing, because you see that outside of his Problems Marc is an intelligent, funny guy who is genuinely interested in the interior lives of these famous guests, and he manages to get them to talk about the real, relevant emotional and personal stuff of their lives, perhaps by the very virtue of his being so honest about his own problematic relationship with himself.
"
404,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"I rarely recognize the guests, but every episode is an examination of the self and of empathy. It isn't laugh-every-minute, since it looks at artists' lives and Marc doesn't mock their experiences. The comedy slowly comes out in the irony of life, making the podcast feel like the raw material to Maron's own stand-up. I wouldn't call it ""dark,"" since the guests have had their troubles and Maron recounts his own anxieties from the past and present, but everyone I've heard has kept going and has some nugget of wisdom that makes me feel pretty good by the end of each episode.
"
405,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"My favorite interview podcast out there. At his best, Marc is wide-open, honest, personal, hilarious, and smart. He produces the show well, and I haven't heard a show where he mailed it in or did not connect well with his guest. I would say if you don't like stand up comedy you will get a bit too much ""insider baseball"" about the inner workings of that profession when he interviews a fellow comic, and he'll defer a bit too much to those guests even if they ramble a bit, but if you don't like stand up you probably aren't listening anyway. But there's a lot to love for those who don't like the stand up. Case in point: the Lena Dunham interview. Really entertaining on a number of levels. Always looking forward to the next WTF.
"
406,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"Not only is this the only podcast my boyfriend and I can agree on, but we get more excited than is probably socially acceptable every time a new podcast episode is released.
Marc Maron is angst-y, heartfelt, and brutally honest in the best way possible. He broaches subjects with interviewees that others may shy away from. It's that commitment to interesting and thought-provoking podcasts that we find so absolutely fascinating. He is very funny and captivating and each episode seems too short.
We started listening because we love his stand-up, and are extremely happy with our choice to start listening.
I would definitely recommend this podcast for anyone sick of puff pieces, or uninteresting interviews that ask the same old questions.
"
407,WTF with Marc Maron Podcast,5,"Marc is just a man who has a passion for finding out what makes other people passionate, how they have gotten to where they are and all the experiences in between. He's real, he doesn't hide his own struggles to seem cool - which makes him this lovable, fallable human just talking to another person about ""making it."" Which in the end, we discover, is just an outlook. If we ""made it"" or not is completely dependent on us and our attitudes. Thanks for being human and asking the questions other media people were afraid to ask.
"
408,Criminal,5,"Perhaps it would surprise you if I said I've listened to each episode of Criminal entirely 5 or so times. It shouldn't, though: I expect PRX to have multiple awards for this storytelling masterpiece. Crisp sound, unwinding storylines, probing interviews - Criminal is the cold standards others have been unable to crack and produce themselves. I can relisten to my favorites every few weeks, without boredom, like Racehorse Hanes, Lavendar Scare, The Procedure, In Plain Sight, Perfect Specimen, and Open Case. A new episode aired today, are you as excited as me?
"
409,Criminal,5,"The production quality of this show is flawless, really easy to listen to. They bring in a variety of guests and cover everything remotely related to criminal acts from the traveling electric chair to leaving a giant Buddha statue in the verge.
This show deserves a spot in your playlist.
"
410,Criminal,5,"1/2 podcast I listen to daily. I first heard about this show on 99 Percent Invisible. It is easily one of my favorite podcasts. Every morning Phoebe Judges' voice and questions take me into worlds beyond my own, and a little more paranoid of who is sitting beside me. An all around great quality production. As there are so many insightful topics and explorations of each topic, I really love when there is a two-parter, diving deeper into each nugget of the story.
"
411,Criminal,5,"The stories are really touching, presented with high journalistic standards, and the host is really likable. Awesome!
"
412,Criminal,4,"It's well structured but one thing is that the narrator/speaker sounds like she's almost whispering, I had to turn my sound up quite a bit to hear her more.
"
413,Criminal,5,"I first heard about this show on 99 Percent Invisible. It is now my favorite show to listen to. The host's voice, questions and narrations are lovely. Great production quality in general, with no silly sound effects.
"
414,Criminal,5,"Absolutely love this podcast - my only wish is that there were more than two episodes a month.
"
415,Criminal,4,"I love this show. The production is great and the stories are great. The older episodes are better Imo. I am still absolutely a fan and listen to each episode but lately the show seems to be gravitating more towards ""Victim"" and less toward ""Criminal"" Just seems to be getting more in depth about the victim of a crime than it used to instead of just talking about the crime itself or the ""criminal"" committing the crime.
"
416,The NPR Politics Podcast,4,"NPR politics is a good podcast for keeping up on the political landscape. They don't get lost in the weeds of politics and do a decent job painting the big picture. My only complaint is while the hosts try their best to present a balanced and unbiased description of events, it's evident that the show leans slightly left/center-left on the political spectrum. They handle it well though, and they are certainly engaging in journalism, not punditry, and show the other side pretty fairly so this can be forgiven. It's one of my favorite political podcasts.
"
417,The NPR Politics Podcast,4,"I've always loved the format of NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour, but the content has always disappointed me. Hearing four different opinions on the latest comic book hero movie? Just hearing one is too many. So hearing the NPR Politics podcast ""borrow"" the format in my opinion is a stroke of genius. Finally - a valid format but now with something to say. Well done!
"
418,The NPR Politics Podcast,5,"The podcast is great. I like the input each member has. I get a little frustrated when it feels that the group is becoming biased but it does not last that long. They really seem to present the information. I laugh a lot at their ""Can't let it go"" segment. I hope they stay on beyond the presidential election and they find a niche
"
419,The NPR Politics Podcast,5,"Despite other reviews, NOT 1 sided, held it's tongue in providing blow by blow events that shaped the election. Looking forward to it's focus on policy. Does a great job of contextualizing and spinning forward possibilities. It will miss Asma Khalid's substance, but addition by subtraction with Sam Sanders leaving.
"
420,The NPR Politics Podcast,2,"I generally turn off this podcast about halfway through because they seem to cover only the surface-level material available for the day's news. It never feels like they've done the background reading required to really do analysis.
They have the distinct disadvantage of coming after The More Perfect Union podcast on my player, which is much deeper in spite of being an amateur effort. I'd recommend that podcast as an alternative if NPR Politics Podcast isn't doing it for you.
"
421,The NPR Politics Podcast,5,"I'm also a fan of Slate's Political Gabfest. The NPR Politics podcast is a nice complement. I love the camaraderie between the NPR reporters. You can tell they are really enjoying themselves, and that makes the politics talk more engaging.
"
422,The NPR Politics Podcast,5,"If you're expecting editorialised opinions about everything Trump and Clinton say and do, look elsewhere. But if you're interested in how likely they are to win based on polls, and how the campaign process works, then subscribe and learn.
"
423,The NPR Politics Podcast,5,"I listen to each every NPR politics podcast. The regular weekly Thursday content is always relevant and up-to-date and extra editions are added to cover breaking news. Tamara Keith, Mara Liason, Scott Detrow, Suzanne Davis, and the entire crew of fine journalists are stationed on the front lines and therefore are able to report on the words and actions of primary sources. Tamara for example is about to accompany the president on his overseas trip, Mara has a (tiny?) desk in the Whitehouse, and Suzanne seems to have a phone booth (?) in the Capitol. In addition to delivering outstanding content the process is well-honed and deserving of high praise for its display of active listening, mutual respect, absence of interruptions or grandstanding or getting in the way of the news, and collegiality among the multiple participants in each podcast. This makes for an listener- friendly, listener-centered environment which facilitates the accessibility and comprehension of the content and the learning that ultimately follows. Thank you NPR Politics podcast!
"
424,Invisibilia,5,"What a fantastic, mind boggling, refreshing and crucially important show in these times of so much disinformation!! Simply BRILLIANT! Thank you from Brazil!!
"
425,Invisibilia,3,"I love this show. It's smart, true, thoughtful, honest, willing to go deep -- each story is like one of those lengthy new yorker articles of old that makes you breathe deep and thank goodness for great journalists.
"
426,Invisibilia,5,"I am coming into this podcast as an avid Radiolab listener - I have listened to all the Radiolab podcasts mulitple times over... so I am looking for something new to absorb. Invisibilia is similar in their approach to investigation and impactful story-telling, but stands apart with their overall theme and positivity. The more emotive and empathetic subject matter is also very interesting, and I have ended up researching more about subjects after listening to these podcasts. Give me more!
"
427,Invisibilia,5,"I'm just enthralled with this show. So dimensional. Very multifaceted. Pulls you into the real world with rich and subtle nuances. Nothing mundane about it. I learn something new and interesting in every episode. Such a treat.
"
428,Invisibilia,4,"I have listened to the first two episodes (Batman and Thoughts) and cannot wait to listen to each of them again. How great is that?
"
429,Invisibilia,5,"The show is FANTASTIC. Each episode is different, but all are excellent. The shows are explorations of human experiences and reactions that offer insight into our own lives. Many shows feature extreme stories which can sound exotic at first -- but the stories are extreme because they distill an idea or emotion and that allows us to see it and focus on it. For example, the show ""the new norm"" is about men on Shell's oil rigs finding wonderful results (better efficiency, better safety) from classes on interpersonal relationships and letting go of ""manly"" virtues like not asking for help. Few of us ever will work in such dangerous places or have bosses at work who urge us to share intimate personal details with our co-workers. BUT the story shows the value of breaking down pre-conceived barriers most of us follow without thinking about them. All with high integrity to truth and an intimacy with the hosts who take us through the ideas. i love this show.
"
430,Invisibilia,5,"I really love the content of this show. I want to like it. However, the vocal fry is just so bad. I have a really hard time listening to it. If the one girl would just use more air when she talks without frying her voice, I would absolutely love this show.
"
431,Invisibilia,5,"I'm hooked. Solid reporting. The producers weave threads that surprise you in the end: they make it worth listening to every second. No time wasted with mindless banter (not my thing). Smart interviews and diverse stories that make you wonder what characters are the the true 'villains' and 'heroes' of our lives.

432,Behind the Bastards,5,"I never expected to like this show as much as I do. Not that it doesn’t look interesting, but it’s just not totally in my normal wheelhouse of true crime, fringe religion, and conspiracy theory podcasts (I subscribed after listening to the L. Ron Hubbard episodes). But I will literally stop listening to any of my other shows to switch to this one when there’s a new episode. Even if I don’t know the subject, or never thought the person was that interesting, Robert does a great job telling their stories. I love the banter with the guest hosts as well, which is entertaining, and doesn’t usually derail the topic too much. Overall, one of my favorite podcasts out there right now.
"
433,Behind the Bastards,1,"Have been a fan of Robert Evans since Cracked, and I do really like BtB. Really well researched about lots of interesting people, about whom I have known very little. Robert Evans is very funny, and he backs this up with knowledge about the subject they're discussing, but too often the podcast is let down by the comedians who guests on the show. They're basically given free-reign to derail Robert's monologues for no reason except to jump in with a poor one-liner. This is made worse when the host and the guest aren't recording in the same location and the sound delay makes these interruptions painfully drawn out and awkward. Great podcast, though. Just wish the comedians would either engage with what Robert is talking about, or not interrupt so much.
"
434,Behind the Bastards,5,"This is the only podcast I consistently recommend & I check every day to see if there has been a bonus podcast or if I just somehow missed a recent release. Be warned that if you lean toward the right politically, you might have a bad time as (shocker!) many of the most evil people in history align themselves with conservative politics/rhetoric which is not the fault of the hosts, it's just the truth! However, if you love a good laugh (in the saddest of ways sometimes) give it a listen.
"
435,Behind the Bastards,4,"I like Robert and I've liked a lot of his guest hosts, and the topics are often very enlightening, but it's pretty rare for Robert to stop talking before a guest interrupts him and he's actually pretty bad about butting in on his guests as well. I think it actually used to be better in this regard, but ever since Robert had the little episode of throwing pens around the studio, it seems like he or the producer have lost control of the show. The content is solid, but they really need to tighten up.
"
436,Behind the Bastards,5,"An excellent combination of current events, history, & humor, BtB is the only podcast I recommend. Each episode leaves me laughing in frustration at the evils of humans, but also craving Doritos. Not sure where to start? I recommend the episodes on Gaddafi.
"
437,Behind the Bastards,3,"I find very few podcasts informative and funny simultaneously. This is the only one out there for me so far. I see some people complaining about the hosts' humor, but I personally like them a lot, and I'm really picky. Give it a few episodes, and if you don't like them, then clearly it's not for you. After a few, I was hooked. Robert Evans is clearly a bright dude, and he's able to boil down a lot of information into solid hour-ish episodes.
"
438,Behind the Bastards,5,"I'm so glad that I'm not disappointed after checking out a few episodes today. The production is well done and the host is able to provide some interesting insights into some mainstream figures/personalities. I personally have not run into the audio issues that another reviewer mentioned, but I've also only listened to more recent episodes. Hooked and can't wait for more. Lots of horrible people and maybe we can all aspire to be better in a world full of bs.
"
439,Behind the Bastards,5,"The show is basically some millennials who view history through the spectrum of their political opinions. They've had like 20 different subjects so far and can't find anyone left in history worse than Ted Cruz, Charles Koch and the Reagans. They aren't nearly as funny as they think they are and could probably easily edit out 30-40% of the podcasts. You guys should should check out podcasts like feakanomics or stuff you missed in history class where they can provide great content without being annoyingly political and obviously partisan.
"
440,Global News,5,"I am a Chinese student, I listen to global news as well as BBC everyday. I am updated with latest news of every corner of the world, which is really helpful to my English learning. I think the content of news could be more varied, not always just politics, economy. Generally speaking, I love it very very much.
"
441,Global News,5,"Use it weekly for long road trips through places where I get no cell service. Just download the latest few shows before the trip, plug iphone into USB port in car and off we go. In-car interface is pretty clean and easy to use. 
Some improvements on recognizing that I have no reception could help as it sometime tries to search for a download although I want it to stay offline. 
"
442,Global News,5,"An organisation with a history of unbiased reporting, the BBC World Service is a great source for news and analysis. The quality of reporting is very high. The Global News Podcast marries the best elements of the reports into a listenable chunck. Been listening on my way to work. Great source along with BBC Newshour.
"
443,Global News,5,"My favourite podcast for news - starts with the most serious global news story and gives that a lot of focus, moves on to other important world issues, wraps up with something interesting in culture, science, or human interest. At 25-35min its the perfect news for breakfast without being too brief or too wordy.
"
444,Global News,4,"If you like a quick rundown of important headline news first thing in the morning, then you need Stitcher. If you're a nerd, geek, news junkie, or a seeker of knowledge and entertainment, then you need Stitcher. Stitcher is like my morning coffee, except that I don't drink coffee. 
"
445,Global News,4,"More and more as TV declines, I use my iPhone as a radio, one with increasingly better speakers, and one easily set to turn off after I fall asleep at night. The Stitcher app furnishes the Internet listener with quite intelligent programming, not re-runs of Gilligan's Island.
"
446,Global News,5,"It is great to have access to the BBC via Stitcher!  BBC's presentation on Stitcher allows me to listen to their valuable & informative programming on my schedule, rather than on the schedule of the local public radio network . . . . a schedule which I always seem to miss!
"
447,Global News,5,"Currently living overseas where I barely get news from the next State it is wonderful to have access to the BBC and what is really going on in the world. Global News rounds up the most important stories and keeps me up to date with what is happening in the world.
"
448,TED Radio Hour,5,"I love your show but you seem to have made it impossible to download the podcast this week. I put them on my phone to listen to when commuting. I don't have time to sit at my laptop live streaming or whatever so I will now not be able to listen to your show which is very frustrating. Why have you done this? The listen later thing doesn't work in any of my browsers, doing save as on any of the clickables only gives me html files. Stitcher doesn't work either and I will never use iTunes as a matter of principle. Why break something that didn't need fixing in the first place.
"
449,TED Radio Hour,1,"I never have the time (or much interest) in sitting down and Watching TED talks, but they are still amazing. What this show does is pulls together 3 or 4 or 5 of the talks by theme. There are excerpts of the talks interspersed with wonderful interviews of the talkers. Absolutely outstanding, and, of course, inspiring.
"
450,TED Radio Hour,1,"What an amazing show! I stumbled upon this a few months ago and I am hooked. Amazing topics. Great guests. It helps that they have a different guest as essentially the new 'topic' for that show. More than that, the questions the hosts ask and insights to the topic presented by the guest are spot on! Clearly they have done their homework. Productions are excellent. Variety in the presentation makes it so easy to follow. I am nearly always inspired! MUST add to your playlist!
"
451,TED Radio Hour,5,"I'm a fan of TED Talks and this show is great for helping listeners learn about the vast archives of TED, as well as bringing listeners up to date on what has happened since the speaker has given the talk. I like the combination of replaying parts of the TED Talk plus the fresh interview. Always interesting!
"
452,TED Radio Hour,5,"I just finished listening to ""Gender, Power, and Fairness"". While the topics presented on this podcast are usually balanced and well though out, this particular presentation was abhorrently agenda driven and one-sided. This was not about ""Gender"" nor was it about ""Fairness"". This was a typical, main-stream, man-bashing, feminist presentation. Every talk was essentially man-bad-woman-good and absolute no counter-points were offered. At the least, the pod-cast was poorly titled. Frankly ""Fairness"" should be removed. I was disappointed.
"
453,TED Radio Hour,4,"The audio and production quality on this show (as on any NPR show) is stellar. But after listening to several episodes, I've concluded that there's practically nothing valuable here except for the TED talk content itself, of which there is too little (and that is too scattered to make sense). Please give me the TED talks themselves instead.
"
454,TED Radio Hour,1,"The production did an excellent job in interlocking different TED talks into coherent themes so far. Every show makes me change my perception about the topic in question. This is a 'must-have' podcast for those who like to think 'out-of-the-box' and being inspired by amazing people. I like the way Guy Raz, the host, interviews the speakers. He asks the right questions is the most charming way. In short, very recommended show!
"
455,TED Radio Hour,3,"I don't have time to listen to many TED talks in their entirety, much as I would like. TED Radio Hour provides the solution. The show cleverly condenses a few standout TED talks on relevant topics (""Happiness"" for instance, or ""Why we Cheat""), intersperses them with interviews of the TED speakers and also with insightful commentary, and presents a thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking hour of listening. Excellent show!
"
456,The Generation Why Podcast,4,"I happened upon this podcast while searching for true crime and mystery podcasts. One look at the episode list and I was sure this was the podcast for me. However, the Maura Murray episode was disappointing. First, there was inappropriate host laughter during this story, which made him seem even more clueless about the facts. Second, the story was vague and some of the truly important facts were wrong or omitted. These facts are public knowledge. This makes me think that if the research on a story, that I am very familiar with, was incomplete, how solid are the facts in other stories? Keeping an open mind...
"
457,The Generation Why Podcast,2,"I stumbled on the show a few weeks back and I've been addicted since then. I've finally caught up on episodes, which I'm pretty sad about. I enjoy the delivery,and I enjoy Justin and Aaron's opinions on cases and issues. I even like Justin's nervous laughter, because it's genuine. I like the show isn't perfect or over-produced. It's real, Justin and Aaron are real, and I like the flaws that come with realness. I recommend the show to every friend I have that also enjoys podcasts, and I look forward to future episodes. Please keep up the stellar work, guys! If I drank beer, I'd want to share one with y'all.
"
458,The Generation Why Podcast,2,"I HATE when true crime podcasters decide to do a story that has been covered in depth by every single media outlet for decades, sometimes a bit less than decades. Please tell me, what are you going to add to this story? Don't do a check list of proular cases, don't jump on bandwagons, just to ""keep up with the Jones"" I didn't even listen, there is ZERO that hasn't been said. I LOVE your obscure cases. I am a fan since day ONE though. I am grateful for every podcast you do release, I understand the amount of work and the time it consumes, I appreciate it. I just don't enjoy cases that have become over saturated. I have to rate this choice a 1, most days it would be a solid 5.
"
459,The Generation Why Podcast,5,"They do a great job researching and laying out the story but is it just me or do they seem to often times take the side of the defendant? They regularly accuse the police and DA offices of being lazy or corrupt with zero evidence to back up any of their theories. Their personal opinions really dominate the show which can be hard to listen to. And you can often hear the person who isn't speaking breathing through their nose right into the mic, which I realize is a petty complaint but yeesh its annoying.
"
460,The Generation Why Podcast,1,"I got turned on to this podcast after being infuriated with the junk that is Thinking Sideways. After realizing that TS literally does read from Wikipedia (whether they want to admit it or not), I was skeptical of all crime shows. In my opinion, these guys do their research and present facts objectively (in most cases). I like that they have case experts on regularly. Yes, there is some laughter that others are deeming inappropriate, but I don't feel that they are laughing at the cases/victims or taking it lightly. The laughter is directed at theories that others have had about the case, or just ridiculous nonsense, and there is a difference. Thinking Sideways is the epitome of poor taste and obnoxious and this is a 180 degree turn.
"
461,The Generation Why Podcast,3,"I hear about this podcast from another show and was very interested so I listened to as many episodes that I could stand...3. The content is very interesting but I can not stand the way they leave out facts, assume facts about the cases and cut each other off. One of them will be talking and the other person cuts in and talks over the other person. They say ""they will...and she/he will"" A LOT and it gets very annoying. I just wish they approached it differently. I was ready to love this podcast but was severely disappointed.
"
462,The Generation Why Podcast,5,"If you start with their first episode and then skip to more recent episodes, say the last year, they have improved greatly on their editing, sound and overall quality. If you are looking to dip your toe into true crime, murders etc then this is a great podcast with Justin and Aaron discussing popular and not so popular murders. They discus a new crime every episode so don't expect ground breaking discoveries, maybe new perspectives. I don't think either of them have a law background or anything, like their description says, two friends discuss...
"
463,The Generation Why Podcast,2,"These guys don't know what they are talking about; strictly opinion based, but likeable (very mid west dudes). One of the hosts, Aaron, does his research adding most of the fact based information. The other one, Justin, does not do proper research yet adds an emotional perspective. It's a good dynamic. Both hosts are monotone which is a pro or a con depending on your mood. Though awkward at times they are clearly old friends. Big pro for that.
"
464,Staying In with Emily & Kumail,5,"Perfect balance of funny and thoughtful! Thank you!
"
465,Staying In with Emily & Kumail,5,"To be fair, March 2020 sucked. But this show super doesn't! It's wonderful!
"
466,The Moth,5,"This weekend my family and I attended the memorial service of a high school teacher of 29 years and a member of our family, and it was astounding how much he had done, what funny stories he had, and the kind of remarkable person he was. My mom leaned into me and said, if only he had done a Moth podcast that we could always have to remember him by. The Moth offers something wonderful and unique and should be appreciated for the unique version of oral tradition and storytelling that humanity needs to function!
"
467,The Moth,5,"When I first was introduced to The Moth, it was hard to get into. I think it's because I was used to other podcast formats (like This American Life, Freakonomics, etc.), but I thought each episode was a hit or miss. But now that I've stuck with it, every story is so enjoyable because it's someone's story. It's now my favorite podcast and I wish I could listen to this all day rather than waiting for a new episode each week. For those not interested yet, stay with it and it'll become your favorite thing ever!!!!!
"
468,The Moth,5,"I think that the moth is the most wonderful show in creation- it makes me happy when skies are grey.. I love the moth so much.. I wonder how my life would have had about one thousand less laughs and omg.. if I did not know you existed. Actually, I did not know about the Moth until my ex introduced me to it.. and I can tell you it wasn't worth all his pain.. but, it was almost worth it.. It was funny but my ex saved the story about Mike Rips from Omaha Nebraska.. It was a hoot. My first listen and I could so relate to the story. And, the Moth is great because.....I can look at people on the street and think maybe these strangers are a bit like me, quirky,with a point of view that is priceless... I love the Moth, did i tell you that already?
"
469,The Moth,5,"A peek inside the lives of everyday people. Stories can be funny, cute, touching, and at times even shocking. I only wish the weekly cast was longer. 
"
470,The Moth,5,"Easy to listen to because the podcasts are so brief (just one or two stories) I check ""Like"" for episodes of this podcast more than anything else I listen to!
"
471,The Moth,5,"The emotional content is always so varied. The hosts don't get in the way. The story tellers themselves always composed and fitting of mood, never taken away by any obnoxious atmosphere in the crowd. I also listen to 'Risk' 'Story Worthy' 'Porchlight' and 'Snap Judgement' my favorites are The Moth and Snap Judgement. But I listen to those two for slightly different reasons; whereas Snap Judgement is highly produced and more of variety show feel, the Moth is just straight up RAW story telling. Great time spent.
"
472,The Moth,5,"Love to listen to stories about other people's lives. These a short ones thought usually 10 to 20 mins an episode. If you like longer ones I recommend checking out Risk! 
"
473,The Moth,5,"It doesn't get much better than the Moth. I've laughed, cried, and learned. 
"
474,The Indicator from Planet Money,5,"Short, interesting and almost always fun. If I had to choose only one podcast to listen to for the rest of my life, this would be the one. I can't believe I'm the first person to rate it on Stitcher. Y'all are missing out.
"
475,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"If you love the HBO broadcast of this show every Friday night, you'll love this full audio podcast of the same show. The show combines insightful commentary (by Bill Maher and a panel of guest commentators from the worlds of politics, news, entertainment, and publishing), current events, politics, and humour. Added features allow you to listen to the podcasts of Bill's weekly dress rehearsal of his opening monologue (you'll sometimes hear jokes that didn't make it into the broadcast) and ""Overtime"" (the HBO webcast of the weekly panel's discussion of questions and comments received from the internet and social media). Even without the visuals, this show is highly entertaining, guaranteed to make you laugh, and great to listen to during your workout. The ""New Rules"" alone, are worth the price of admission.
"
476,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"I love this show and could not be happier to see that it's on stitcher. The guests bring humor and new sides to the argument that is interesting. You can catch up on the news and still laugh your socks right off with Bill Maher's quick wit and crude sense of humor that is pleasantly honest and addictive. A deliciously intelligent and hilarious program. Obviously may not be a show you want your three year old to watch, but all I can say is I desperately wish I could be part of the audience at one of his tv shows. Hope you check it out and enjoy! 
"
477,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"Humor that is intellectually stimulating. Unlike this Review which is ridiculous in requiring a certain number of words to complete. Bill Maher should make the author of this requirement the butt of one his jokes. Use some common sense! Fewer words can be much more descriptive than a long litany. If the designer of this format for a Review had written the Bible - the Lions would have won. I hope I have used enough words to qualify for publication.
"
478,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"I would encourage everyone to watch and listen to this show, because it is factual and highlights the present burning issues in the American society there is never a dull moment. It is humorous since Bill has his unique style of presenting the topic to his audience who are experts in the subject matter and with facts enlightens everyone to see the issues discussed as it should be understood.
"
479,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"To be able to listen to Real Time is the only reason I signed up for sticher. It's by far the most common sensed and ""real"" conversation about what's important in today's news outlets. I am better informed for listening and better entertained by Real Time than by any other news outlet.
"
480,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"He sits on a perch few can emulate - he's earned his right to call to task the lesser enlightened and lesser educated among us to suggest evolution is not to be feared. And in my view progressives need to ramp up. He totes his weight by pointing out what should be done for the planet and for a society that can't seem to get out of their own way.
"
481,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"Bill Maher is definitely one of the funniest comics of our time in the tradition of Will Rogers and George Carlin. All his shows are revelent to our current times ... Bill has great depth of wisdom as well ... I thoroughly enjoy all his shows and his remarkable interaction with his guests ... A 5 Star program for sure.
"
482,Real Time with Bill Maher,5,"Bill and most of his guests bring a realistic approach to today's topics. Political ideals and religious agendas are examined, discussed and debated. One would be hard pressed to find a better diversity of views and logical rebuttal. Highly recommended to those not consumed with outdated,  beliefs of yesteryear. 
"
483,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"LOVE PREET'S PODCAST! The insightful discussions & explanations are priceless because they allow us to better understand current events & practice critical thinking for ourselves instead of relying on soundbites and media interpretations. The Bill Browder interview with the Magnitsky Story was absolutely moving as it gave the full back story to Russian Sanctions (& Adoptions). Love the questions and straight talk! Much needed! Thanks Preet!
"
484,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"This is a great show focusing on interesting and often little known facts and experiences. It's no just stories from the US, it is all very relevant to the current general madness affecting the whole world. Mr Preet is a legal expert with solid experience of having served as a US Attorney. He is very good on the radio. Don't know if he realises he has a huge following beyond the US.
"
485,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"Preet Bharara is the perfect guide to investigations into legal issues that really matter right now. Warm, funny, smart, experienced, with access to great guests. After being fired by Trump from his U.S. Attorney post, he provides unparalleled, understandable commentary on the current legal state of affairs - how the Justice Department can function with a meddling president. He offers a prosecutor's insight into the Mueller Russia investigation and much more.
"
486,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"Preet's podcasts are always informative and answers questions that I know I had! Besides presenting interesting content, he's often VERY funny. It's a great combination and I look forward to hearing a new podcast every Thursday!
"
487,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"Want to know what a person with character thinks about the things you think about? Preet interviews smart people talking about things you care about. A former US prosecutor with integrity who knows how the justice system is supposed to work and how it isn't working. Great show !!
"
488,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"Behind the scenes of the goings on in government today from professional, ethical, people. As a self declared news-junkie, this is my new favorite podcast hands-down. Looking forward to the next episodes!!
"
489,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"I must say Special Agent Bharara, I really appreciated your public service and could only wish you were serving now, but in a way you are still providing a much needed public service with your podcast (along with another super hero of mine, Mike Morell!). You provide us, the American people, with insight into the world most of us depend on for our security and protection of our Democracy. The content is not only fascinating but a must listen for those interested in how the free world is protected. Many Thanks! You and MIKE are the DYNAMIC DUO, MIKE alias (VOLUME 1) and PREET alias (VOLUME 2) . For those that are interested in how Mueller created this duo of Super hero's need to listen to the podcast ""Stay Tuned"" w/ Preet and ""Intelligence Matters"" w/ Mike!!
"
490,Stay Tuned with Preet,5,"My wife and I have been listeners since your first show. You've done a wonderful job. Like many people, we wish you would consider running for public office and if a donation of say $25 would grease the skids enough to get you to agree to run, consider it done. Of course, for this kind of money we'd expect you to fix any tickets we got when we visited family in New York. Seriously, if we could give your show 6-stars we would.
"
491,Sword and Scale,5,"I am so glad that I recently discovered 'Sword and Scale'. I loved 'Serial' season one and needed to keep fueling my 'true crime' fix. This podcast has done this and more. I am currently up to episode 21. I don't want to rush through them, as I'll be sad when I catch up and then have to wait a week for each new episode. I can't believe that all these terrible crimes have actually happened and it really makes you think, that this could happen to you. No one is safe! There are some real sickos in world. Who needs television when you have this podcast. For all true crime nerds, you will love this! From cold cases to current trials, it will leave you wanting more.
"
492,Sword and Scale,2,"Mike Boudet says distasteful things that he calls ""jokes."" It is obvious he is trying to be funny but it comes off as idiotic. The content itself is good however Mike tells you the reaction you should have, i.e. ""if these stores don't give you nightmares, you should seek counseling yourself."" Not sure if he is joking here, too, though. If Mike stuck to the content then the podcast would be excellent but when he consistently defends himself from those criticizing him and even dedicates a whole episode to it really took away an enjoyable listening experience. Once I hit that episode, I stopped listening - the cringe hit a 10/10!
"
493,Sword and Scale,5,"I listen to a few different crime podcasts and have quickly added this to one of my favorites! I heard of this podcast in another true crime podcast that I listen to and I am so glad that I looked up Sword and Scale! I think one of my favorite things about listening is the information that is given and how is is laid out throughout the show. There are times where I'll start listening to another show and it's so hard to either keep up or to stay interested, but Sword and Scale as this down pat, very informative and interesting but not overwhelming. So pleasantly surprised and happy that I found this show!
"
494,Sword and Scale,2,"The creator/ narrator has no idea how to edit for a podcast. It almost seems as if he is given himself an arbitrary length for his podcasts and will leave in unnecessary parts of interviews or interject sound clips that don't deal with the topic just achieve this time designation. Interviews and sound clips are supposed to enhance a story and move it forward. With this podcast, it seems like they're put into the edit, at full length, just because they exist, with zero thought put into whether they enhance the topic or progress the story. It a shame too, as the subject matter and research that goes into the show could make for a top-flight podcast.
"
495,Sword and Scale,5,"I just started listening (about 5 shows in now) and am hooked! I'm often turned away by podcasts due to the narrator (either an annoying voice and bad writing)... but I really like this guy. He has a good voice and I find humor in his sinister commentary on society. I like that I have never heard any of these crazy stories (even after years of dateline)... so its nice that the material is fresh. A lot of it is police interrogation recordings which I really like. I have definitely started having bad dreams after listening though, but the same as binge watching dateline. You're listening to stories of the worst side of humanity here, so what do you expect? ;)
"
496,Sword and Scale,2,"I really like this podcast - you can tell there's a lot of research and effort put into the show. I like the style with interview clips added into Mike's narration.
One thing I absolutely cannot stand, though, are the lengthy clips of audio from actual murders. Example: Episode 33 ends with the sounds of a man being stabbed and beaten to death. I couldn't listen to him groan in agony while hearing the squish of his face, so I had to take out my earbuds. Maybe 10 seconds of this clip (that didn't have much to do with the main story btw) would have been okay but the whole clip was bone chilling. It seems gratuitous.
"
497,Sword and Scale,5,"This show is the audible equivalent to the I Survived TV show. I have watched many, MANY true crime shows and documentaries, so many that eventually I felt like I knew of almost all infamous cases. This show has brought a fresh pile of tales of murder, mysteries and head scratchers for me to listen to. Great job. One complaint (why it's not 5 stars) is that there is no easy way to navigate previous episodes. In order to get to earlier episodes from either Stitcher or the actual show's website, I have to click, and click and click the load more episodes button. There should be a drop down box for old episodes, in my opinion. In example: (episodes 1-14) click here (episodes 15-24) click here......something along those lines.
"
498,Sword and Scale,2,"If your idea of a good Friday night is binge watching Investigation Discovery for hours, this is the podcast for you. Best crime podcast I've come across so far. I went back and listened to all the old episodes and you can see how the show has evolved over time. The current format of the show is awesome. Very high sound quality and great editing and use of music. This is NOT one of those podcasts that sounds like it was recorded in a garage on a cell phone. Keep up the good work :)
"
499,Science Vs,5,"Science VS picks the BEST topics whenever a new episode comes out I say to myself I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT HOW DID THEY KNOW and they do such a phenomenal job of getting the facts across in a balanced & unbiased yet entertaining way.
"
500,Science Vs,5,"I love this show! Informative and interesting. Highly recommended.
"
501,Science Vs,5,"This is top-notch science communication. The show always gives a great overview of the issues, while keeping it funny and fun. I wish my university lectures were all as entertaining as Wendy Zukerman!
"
502,Science Vs,5,"Science vs is a great show, they always provide references adn citations for everything they state. It's not about a ""truth"" but about presenting the facts and contrasting different arguments.
"
503,Science Vs,5,"Science vs is my favuorite science podcast because it delves into problems that are relevant to the present times and always gives understandable answers. The explanations and the structure of the show itself are specifically designed not only to engage the audience but to make the information digestible and for you to feel entertained and overall better about understanding the topic after 30 minutes. I love the fact they are not afraid to talk even about problems that are quite controversial for most people, it really helps me get an insight into the problem. And let's not forget the great stories about history of science, I love these episodes, plus they are really helpful when trying to impress someone ;) ... come to think of it the whole show is really helpful in that regard :))) So one big thank you to the entire team for your work and dedication! :) Hope we'll get a lot of new episodes from you in the future!
"
504,Science Vs,2,"Science Vs has in the past done a good job of looking at both sides of an argument, albeit with the time constraint often data must be summarized to fit in the 30 minute episodes. Anyone who has actively researched topics can understand this problem, however as of late it seems they are more interested in pushing topics which are more political and less scientific. The most recent episode about abortion has little science to backup what is said in the episode, and delves primarily into a simple talk about the history of abortion in the states. There was no science involved in the episode. Please, go back to science, get out of the opinion mud. I can find plenty of other podcasts which don't look at fact and just want to push opinions. Might as well listen to garbage on fan-fiction.
"
505,Science Vs,5,"Wendy is a fabulous host and their science is so researched and cuts no corners. I really appreciate being given the full story behind each topic and the show is so much fun!
"
506,Science Vs,5,"When I finish listening to this podcast I feel more informed! She represents different sides of the arguments and identifies the key points of views. This is fantastic!
"
507,The Rewatchables,5,"Bill and his crew of miscreants take deep dives on some of the classic movies of the last 40 years or so. There is much to learn under the microscope of repeated viewing. They will get into the film, the reviews, the culture, the filming process, the casting decisions, and much more. You want ludicrous hypotheticals? They got em. Even when you think you know you might learn something. I particularly enjoyed episodes on the Princess Bride, Tombstone, the Godfather, and Clueless.
"
508,The Rewatchables,5,"You guys are the best, a bunch of funny friends talking about movies with equal parts humor and passion. Bill, Sean, Chris, Russillo, and Mallory are my favorites - they don't take themselves too seriously and have genuinely hilarious commentary.
Potential rewatchable - Panic Room?!
"
509,The Rewatchables,3,"I used to really like this show, but it's gotten mighty repetitive. Fennessy describes 90% of the movies featured as ""weird"" for some reason; Ryan loves to scream a lot; and Simmons seems to think that just by watching a ton of movies he's somehow an expert and his opinions (no matter how off-base) are indisputable.
"
510,The Rewatchables,5,"This show just makes you feel happy. I crack up but also just feel like I am listening to my friends talk about a movie they love. I love hearing all of the hosts opinions. You are all great and I cant wait for more episodes. I especially loved the When Harry Met Sally and Pretty Woman episodes.
"
511,The Rewatchables,5,"I just found this podcast this week and I've already become addicted! So far my favorite episodes have been When Harry Met Sally and Pretty Woman. The commentary and what ifs are very interesting and I've found myself agreeing with the hosts many times.
"
512,The Rewatchables,4,"Enjoyed your review of Inglorious B... - but was annoyed by the fact that you couldn't imagine Dicaprio playing in the movie because it would be a challenge to speak german - fail by your research department - his mother is German and he speaks German.
"
513,The Rewatchables,4,"I love the content, but Mallory Rubin needs to speak in a louder voice. I can't stand the scratchy low voice, had to abandon a few episodes because of this.
"
514,Ground Zero Media,5,"If you are a critical thinker and use your brain then this show is for you. It is NOT a one dimensional show either. Clyde is good at varying the topics yet maintaining updates on current events. I do not agree with 100% of the content that is presented by him and callers but that's the beauty of the show. Information is presented and YOU the listener make an informed decision for yourself. I respect the heck out of Clyde for allowing his listeners to come to their own conclusions about the info presented. I haven't missed a show in about a year. 
"
515,Ground Zero Media,5,"I believe the shows to be very intriguing and entertaining and one of the most informative shows that is on anywhere. I also like the way he stands up for what he believes in and doesn't just pacify every person that wants to challenge what he may be speaking about for that day. At first I was truly upset that they introduced Ground Zero on my local radio station due to the fact that they played it in the spot where the Coast to Coast with George Noorey played their shows previous nights show. This upset me because that was the only chance I got to listen to Coast to Coast, but after listening to Ground Zero for awhile, I really liked it even better. Now Ground Zero is all I ever listen to while driving, thanks to Stitcher.
"
516,Ground Zero Media,4,"I found this show about 2 months ago. I listen almost every night.If its not live I listen to a repeat show. I always learn something new.  I would compare it to the ""Art Bell"" days of Coast to Coast. Very entertaining, informative and it always makes me think about things with a new perspective. It causes me to ""think"" and that's a good thing! 
"
517,Ground Zero Media,5,"I first found out about this show in prison and listened to it on AM 560 in Northern Connecticut and was (and still am) deeply impressed with the truthfulness and diversity of the topics that ""mainstream media"" were not covering. Mr. Lewis is a very well educated, well spoken, and isn't afraid to speak his mind regarding the truth. I thank not only Mr. Lewis, but the entire Ground Zero team for not just putting on a great show, but for being one of the few shows to actually do the research and KNOW what they're talking about. Keep up the fantastic work.
"
518,Ground Zero Media,5,"To say Ground Zero is addictive! Late night radio has a new KING, GZ is never boring. Hold onto your hat when Clyde talks politics...everyone is fair game.
"
519,Ground Zero Media,5,"love the show. keep up the good work! ill keep listing
"
520,Ground Zero Media,5,"This man and his information makes my road-time something to look forward to. I'm a delivery driver, so i'm always looking for something that can keep my interest and reliably deliver entertaining and engaging content. Somehow, Clyde manages to present informed, thoughtful information with humility and curiosity. My other go-to shows for those looking for authentic honest voices on the fringe and paranormal, I recommend Belief Hole Podcast for their research, storytelling and brotherly laughs, and The Freeman Perspective for Freeman's open-hearted esoteric authenticity and warm nature. See you all on the fringes fellow listeners!!
"
521,Ground Zero Media,5,"Finally, a show that stimulates my intellectual mind and doesn't just give me drivel.
"
522,True Crime All The Time,5,"Great Podcast. I listen to many True Crime Podcasts. This one is fantastic. Great information. I know most of the cases, but I learn so many details that I never knew about the cases I thought I knew everything about. You can tell Mike and Gibby really do a thorough investigation of the crimes they talk about. So many other podcasts sound like the hosts are just reading off the computer. This one does not. It is put together really well. I absolutely love the interaction of the hosts. The humor interjected is great. It is hard for me to wait until the next show comes out.
Great podcast guys. Keep up the good work. I would highly recommend this podcast.
"
523,True Crime All The Time,1,"Personally, I think that this is a well done podcast and one of the best from the get-go. (Some of them it takes a few episodes to get into the groove of things...) They do their homework and make it very entertaining to listen to. It makes time at work go by a lot faster! It was a sad day when I got all caught-up on the podcasts and now I have to wait for a new one to come out. It was awesome listening to them everyday! I can't get enough! (Even with their other podcast ""True Crime All The Time: Unsolved!) Thank you guys for all of the hard work that you do to bring us these stories! I, for one, truly appreciate it! :-)
"
524,True Crime All The Time,5,"A perfect mix of real true crime and dark humor.
Hosts will guide you with well-researched material, authentic tapes and recordings that will slowly flow into your mind allowing you to reach the gruesome events that took place, spicing up the stream with some inappropriately appropriate jokes making you feel more comfortable in your morbid curiosity.
Mike and Gibby are extremely outreaching and you can simply get in contact with them at any social media, they are being responsive and interactive bringing the podcast experience to more close and friendly manner than it actually is.
I love it to bits and even signed up on Patreon support, because creators deserve it. Completely recommend, but be aware: it is not for all audiences due to its nature.
"
525,True Crime All The Time,5,"I am pretty critical of podcasts. I want the hosts to sound like they really are talking to each other (and honestly, single host podcasts just always sound wooden and scripted)and I want them to sound like they have some chemistry. These guys just get it. Do they miss things about cases? Sure. If you listed to 5 podcasts about the same case, you will see difference between them. These guys are interesting to listen to, they tend not to go off on boring tangents, and frankly, they are easy to like. I have listened to a few of their past podcasts, and am now subscribed.
"
526,True Crime All The Time,5,"Mike and Gibby have such a great dynamic that has carried through their podcasts since the get-go. Often providing actual recordings from trials and confessions, the team provides real facts and tidbits to think about for each case they look at. The occasional sarcasm or Gibby's inability to pronounce certain words has me muffling my laughter at work so people don't think I've crazy. I appreciate all the work and research they put into each episode, which is A LOT and as the listener, you get immersed in the story. Highly recommended for any true crime fan!
"
527,True Crime All The Time,5,"It's amazing how much information you guys missed for the Pamela Smart case. 6 months of extreme news coverage. Request to move the trial to another country with less press coverage denied. Judge's denial of defense requests about the character of the teenagers. All three teenage boys being held in cells next to each other, with freedom to move around, giving time to corroborate stories.
Whether or not Pamela smart was guilty, you missed an awful lot. Some really important information. Also, guys, some of the joking you do during your episodes, it really makes them feel sloppy.
"
528,True Crime All The Time,5,"Georgia & Karen turned me on to you guys keep up the Great work! I have just started loved the BTK episodes, I listed at work & makes my day go by fast, I am so glad I have many more to listen to! I will def spread the word!
"
529,True Crime All The Time,1,"I downloaded this podcast a few weeks ago but have stopped listening to them. I am sure they are really nice guys but it feels like they are trying to copy True Crime Garage which has been on air since 2015. The banter between them is not especially funny; the continued foreign accents when reading out the names of supporters is a little boring now and it seems to be a one man show with one of the hosts taking precedence over the other.The other hosts ""Gibby"" (or something) does not really contribute that much. Shame really as I was really hoping fore something different.
"
530,How Did This Get Made?,4,"The show makes me laugh at some of the worst movies ever made. It's like trash talking an awful movie with friends (if your friends were sharp witted professional comedians). The hosts are not afraid to get technical and share information about the making of the movie; some technical, some anecdotal. This provides insight to the final product that I wouldn't have otherwise known. My only issue with the show is that Paul Sheer refers dim-witted and awkward characters as ""on the spectrum"". For me, this is really offensive in a show that's so consistently funny without being mean spirited. They lost a star for that only.
"
531,How Did This Get Made?,1,"How Did This Get Made? is absolutely in my top 5 favorite podcasts of any genre and definitely THE gold standard for a movie podcast! The hosts are witty, insightful and hilarious and they always have great guests!! My only complaint is the frequency with which new episodes are released but I know it takes time to produce such a high-quality podcast and I would never want that to be compromised!! Keep up the great work!!
"
532,How Did This Get Made?,4,"One of my all-time favorite podcasts! I love bad movies and Paul, Jason, June, and their hilarious array of guests hit the nail on the head every time. Their Battlefield Earth, Howard The Duck, and Sleepaway Camp episodes are some of my favorites. Keep these episodes coming!
"
533,How Did This Get Made?,5,"So glad they're back on a regular schedule. If you're looking for laughs, you can't really do better than Paul Scheer (joined as always by June Diane Raphael and Jason Mantzoukas). I have seen very few of the movies that they discuss, but that doesn't diminish the hilarity in the least. Personal favorite episodes: ""88 Minutes"", ""Barb Wire"", ""Gymkata"", ""Double Team"" and ""No Holds Barred"".
"
534,How Did This Get Made?,5,"This show mixes it up: regulars, guests, Amazon reviews, different genres (although I haven't heard them take on religious films yet). They try to make sense of the sometimes crazy worlds of films -- it's not just an endless string of slams. My taste in humour is on the extreme side, so Jason M. is my favourite; I'd prefer sharper takes at times, though that might alienate part of their present audience. Although the language is not censored, sometimes the content is PG.
"
535,How Did This Get Made?,5,"Great podcast, but all the old episodes are now behind a paywall.
"
536,How Did This Get Made?,4,"I started listening to the episodes of this show based on which episodes talked about movies I had seen.  Apparently I need to devote more time to watching bad movies, but these podcasts are so funny it doesn't even matter if you've seen the movie or not.  I didn't expect to enjoy this podcast this much.  
"
537,How Did This Get Made?,1,"In a sea of thousands of podcasts it's hard to fine ones that are simultaneously engaging, informative, and hilarious. How Did This Get Made? is one of those podcasts. Lovers of film and comedy will likely enjoy the hosts' irreverent and analytic takes on some really awful (in a good way) movies. Very highly recommended. 
"
538,The APsolute RecAP: Biology Edition,4,"Great way to review and prepare for the AP bio exam.
"
539,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"Finally! A sasquatch podcast that is worth listening to. I had stopped listening to BF shows a while ago as I was sick of hearing stories about hairy peace and love forest hippies. I came across this show and almost skipped past it. I am so glad I gave it a chance, it is such a pleasure to listen to a show that is open to the most plausible bigfoot explanation; if it is out there it is a wild animal and should be treated as such and you should proceed with the same caution you would give a bear, mountain lion or any other potentially dangerous animal.
"
540,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"I stumbled across the chronicles a while ago back. It was the Honobia show. (EPIC) and made a point to not miss another. Wes,Will and Woody are perfect because their personalities don't dominate the show, they illuminate it. Maybe it was just dumb luck they got together or fate. What ever the case we are lucky, This is an almost taboo subject that most folks wouldn't give the time of day so how, or why is Sasquatch Chronicles still rolling? it's the guys ability to convince witnesses to go back to that time or place when life changed for them, and take us along. Perfect way to end the week.
"
541,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"I'm curious about what Mr. Black has to say on the whole cover up situation. Maybe you could have a show talking more about that if you are thinking of subject matter to discuss. I think if a cover up is going on(most likely the case), it's because there is something extremely important that is kept from the public and this subject would blow it wide open. Imagine the questions that would be brought up, questions we don't even know to ask at this point. Those questions are what I think about.. The ones we don't even know to ask, just yet.
"
542,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"Somehow I was lucky enough to stumble across these guys on their 2nd show and I was hooked. After a possible Bigfoot encounter I had several years ago on the Hoh River, I became obsessed with finding out everything I could about Sasquatch. My major in College was Cultural Anthropology so I had a bit of a knowledge base to start from. This show- hands down - has provided more relevant, informational and educational content than ALL the other shows/sites out there combined. If that's not enough - the entertainment factor is off the charts. AWESOME STUFF.
"
543,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"As a child I remember watching Arthur C Clarks t v shows, I was transfixed with the one on Bigfoot, these shows always made me question everything I saw and heard, as I don't live in America( I live in the North East of England) a can only imagine what its like to live in a country with swaives of forest nearly the size of my country, this is a fantastic radio show, I only wish I lived in America, so I could join you lads on your expedition, keep up the good work on this informative and insightful piece of radio.
"
544,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"The show is great...it allows people to tell their experiences exactly as they happened and it is not colored with the poking of fun and disbelief that usually comes with the territory of bigfoot. I remember my mom used to tell me about the boogie (booger) man ( she was from the south) and all this time I thought it was something she made up to scare us...because I had no reference point... now I find out the boogie man is real!!.. Keep up the good work, keep bringing peole to talk about their real experiences.. it can only help
"
545,Sasquatch Chronicles,4,"It appears to me that the Sasquatch Cronicles Crew has stumbled upon some truth some others don't want us to know about. Having a place to explain your own encounter without feeling like your a target for reticule and being able to talk with other that know there IS something out there is an awesome feeling. I see now the trolls and naysayers have started within this site, but that only shows me that the S.C. crew is getting closer to exposing more of the truth. Keep up the good work Guys!
"
546,Sasquatch Chronicles,5,"Another great show guys! You all describe the place very well and paint a great picture of the area. I'm in AB and didn't know much of what that whole area was like. Very interesting insight on the situation with the poor lady, I'm thinking the same thing. There are area's(known for centuries) that people shouldn't be in, especially alone. It would be totally awesome to go out on that neat expedition thing with you guys but I'm scared lol I like this whole subject from a distance. Be safe out there!
"
547,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"I usually tend to be be too busy around 6 when this show is airing, and I always like to play this ""podcast"" as I'm going to bed or when I'm driving to work. Thank you Stitcher for always having this up in a timely fashion. I usually listen every night around midnight or later and this this is always loaded up. Thank-you. Cramer is the best, such a fun and intelligent personality. He might have some of the best catch phrases of all time.. ""HEY! I'M CRAMMMMERR! Welcome to Mad Money... welcome to Cramerica!""
""BUY! BUY! BUY!""
"
548,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,3,"Where are the updates since 8/5/16? Is this podcast no longer available? If so, quite disappointing. I love these.
"
549,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"What happened to Mad Money? Hasn't been available since 2/918. I see it slipped to 18th place. Is Mad Money going to be available this week?
"
550,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"Cramer rocks! But what happened to the last week of episodes? The only thing that appears is 6 days old.
"
551,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,3,"I love Cramer. He helps the small investor with their portfolios, gives good advice, not afraid to comment on what he knows - and he knows A LOT!! This guy is the real deal. If you follow his advice you can't go wrong. He is worth listening to EVERY DAY!! I Love Cramer's show...
"
552,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"Every time I listen to Jim I come away with great information I know I need for myself, and also pass it along to friends that don't listen - but I sure wish they did! I sometimes watch the show, AND listen to the podcast of it on my way to work - If I've missed the show, I listen to the pod cast . . . I NEED CRAMER
"
553,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"Jim Cramer has been on CNBC for many years, and this is the audio of his TV show. I love Jim's delivery as much as his content, although some of the sound effects are a little loud when listening with my headphones. I am a devoted fan, and listen to almost every show. Check it out ... ""MAD MONEY"".
"
554,Mad Money w/ Jim Cramer,5,"This show is not just a show. It is a lecture for who is in the beginning in the investing field. Everyone must listen the show. It is very informative show for families, seniors, and teens who are interested in learning about stocks and investing.
"
555,FiveThirtyEight Politics,5,"'A year of Mueller' starts off with the bogus Spygate drama put forward by Trump. The panel refers to the informant as someone ON the campaign, then corrects that to associated with the campaign-both untrue. Then they fail to mention that the informant was only interested in and had brief contact with two men known to have ties to Russia, men who were already under investigation before the campaign ever started.
There was no embedding, no infiltrating, no inappropriate action by the FBI. This is sloppy reporting, I am very unimpressed by this show. In todays fast paced news atmosphere, you have to make an effort to keep up in order to be taken seriously.
"
556,FiveThirtyEight Politics,2,"Funny, intelligent, grounded in data with a consistent air of mutual respect around the table. Instead of the competitive partisanship and make-everyone-else-wrong approaches of most political commentators, the conversation here is about testing arguments, trotting out supporting data or information, and looking for common ground and synthesis. That they are willing to be persuaded by one another is remarkable. The playful banter reveals the mutual affection of these folks. And in an era when men still tend to marginalize women’s voices, this is a much appreciated breath of fresh air, and Clare Malone’s voice.
"
557,FiveThirtyEight Politics,2,"The 538 crew do an excellent job analyzing US and worldwide elections and politics from a strategic, unbiased, data-driven standpoint. Since the 2016 election I have gotten extremely sick of how biased media sources have become. 538 is one of the few outlets that doesn't look at news from a predisposed viewpoint but instead is grounded in facts.
"
558,FiveThirtyEight Politics,5,"Silver is best when he is explaining data approach and breaking down election issues into testable units (and he's very good at both of those things). He's not so good when he tries to be the contrarian (but he has gotten better st restraining that impulse). Cohen has good grasp of data and issues. Malone has the most common sense (whether moored in data or not) and grounds the discussion with knowledge of issues and persons. The occasional contributions of Bacon, Rakish and others are well researched and thoughtful.
"
559,FiveThirtyEight Politics,5,"I’ve been listening to this podcast for a few months now and am always looking forward to new episodes. They offer their mostly unbiased views on the week’s political happenings and back their comments up with historical context and polling data. There are very few times they drag you deep into the weeds on anything. The banter throughout the show helps to keep the mood light, which helps when talking about dense subjects. This show helps give a broader view on the political environment.
"
560,FiveThirtyEight Politics,4,"If you want to know when to trust polls and how to read them, this is where to go. Also covers other fact-based analyses (vs. just bloviating).
"
561,FiveThirtyEight Politics,5,"538 and Nate revolutionised polling analysis leading up to 2008. This podcast combines savvy political nous with pleasingly nerdy stats and modelling, Bayesian bets, a bit of inexplicable love/hate banter between Jody and Harry, the sanity of Claire and the grounded, grownup caveats of Nate. Keep it up you guys. Are there plans to continue this after November?
"
562,FiveThirtyEight Politics,5,"I've been listening since before the election. I think they are pretty unbiased in their reporting. They have opinions about things but I think they are excellent about keeping things factual. No mindless cheerleading here.
"
563,Lovett or Leave It,5,"I initially liked this show, but I've grown weary of it for 3 reasons-- 1) Lovett relies on panels of d-list comedians armed with nothing but their millennial ""feelings"" and ""opinions;"" why not sprinkle in a few people who actually know what they're talking about? (for this reason, I much prefer Pod Save the World to any of the other CM offerings); 2) Lovett spends so much time trying to be ""sassy"" he rarely adds any insight or value to the conversation; 3) All mentions of Ronan Farrow. This show, much like the disastrous ""Keep It"" are Crooked Media failures that should be jettisoned as soon as possible.
"
564,Lovett or Leave It,1,"In the age of ""both-sideism,"" this show makes me feel like a human being where we're allowed to be straight shooters. Obviously, respected on both sides.
"
565,Lovett or Leave It,1,"Love the ""loose"" nature of this podcast and John Lovett's amazing chemistry with the audience. If you are worn down by politics, I feel like this one keeps it as light and fun as it can be.
"
566,Lovett or Leave It,5,"I wanted to really like this... but... each episode can be a hit or miss. After months and months of repetitive, sometimes quite unfunny, throw anything-at-the-wall bits and a haphazard, loosey-goosey structure, it got old really fast. Needs more structure and substance. I need to know what I am going to get before I tune in. Pod Save America and Crooked Conversations are the gold winners for me.
"
567,Lovett or Leave It,5,"Enjoying this show immensely. Original. Look forward to each episode.
"
568,Lovett or Leave It,2,"Always interesting and funny. Great guests with very interesting views. Love the games, and the commercials.
"
569,Lovett or Leave It,5,"This is seriously my favorite podcast. Always informative and funny. Quick-witted Jon Lovett is a dream.
"
570,Lovett or Leave It,5,"Makes you laugh even when you want to cry and these days, I aways want to cry.
"
571,Crime in Sports,5,"I started out on STM after a friend told me. Then switched to Crime in Sports! Holy Moly!! Way better, in my opinion. Love them both, but the athletes just bring so much humor to the table on their own. I love sports, and many episodes have been about people I followed when I was younger or had interactions with some of my favorites and it's been an eye opening ""he did WHAT?"" Moment every episode! I keep trying to get my husband to listen as he is much older than me and HUGE into sports. Some of his favorite athletes are here. But he's a boring/crochity old man apparently! Love listening to them try explaining Cricket. And Ric Flair's naked airplane robe woo antics! Just can't get enough!
"
572,Crime in Sports,5,"My daughter and I started listening to Small Town Murder when we took a road trip from Wisconsin to Portland to check out a Law School. I have since listened to all of them and can hardly wait for the week to pass to listen to the new one. So, I started listening to Crime in Sports and I agree that I think I may like it better. Love them both but these are just so crazy and funny. James and Jimmie are amazing!! Keep up the good work!
"
573,Crime in Sports,5,"My only criticism is that I can barely listen to this at work because laughing uproariously in an audit room is frowned upon.
"
574,Crime in Sports,5,"James and Jimmie are one of the best comic duos out there. I laugh until I cry listening to this and Small Town Murder at work and on my commute. I'm sure my co-workers think I have lost my mind! It is especially funny when Jimmie loses it and can't stop laughing! You guys are the BEST! Thanks for all the time you devote to these two podcasts.
"
575,Crime in Sports,5,"These stories talk about athletes from all works of life who manage to completely destroy their gifts talents and potential by behaving like maniacs. The stories cover sports from basketball to cricket, and everything in between. Not only have I learned details about sports I knew nothing about but the characters, famous, infamous, and never heard of, are all brought to life in vivid detail.
"
576,Crime in Sports,5,"I ran out of other murder podcasts and stumbled upon this gem the other day. If you like this genre and want to laugh hysterically (literally spit your food out if you're eating hysterically) this is an absolute must. It reminds me of Martini's and Murder, but less ""Snapped/Oxygen"" and more ""C'Mon Man"". I've already recommended this to several friends!
"
577,Crime in Sports,5,"Following Instructions. This show gets me through my commute. Great research presented with awesome comic relief.
"
578,Crime in Sports,5,"I'm from Wisconsin but I still love you guys! Keep up the great work!
"
579,American History Tellers,5,"I started listening to this podcast few weeks ago. Now I find myself addicted to it. I feel a lot more connected to this land after I started this podcast. It makes me dream about native American while I'm driving home in North Georgia, passing chattahoochee River every day, looking at Sawnee mountain in my horizon. Makes me wonder about prohibition and it's hard to believe that this county has gone through all these stories. As a non American I deeply appreciate what people has done in the past. All the challenges they've gone through to make this country what it is now. And I appreciate your hard work making this podcast.
"
580,American History Tellers,1,"I really like this show. It's very well done. The drama effects are enough to keep you engaged and keep your interest, but they don't distract from the narrative. Many history podcasters tend to drone on like a boring highschool teacher; Lindsay Graham (not the senator :p) is very engaging, like a great story teller. I would say this podcast is more akin to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History... Shorter and with sound effects. :) I recommend to anyone who wants an not-boring American history podcast.
"
581,American History Tellers,5,"I have been an avid listener of this podcast but was dismayed at the selective facts that were included in the Reagan Revolution episode. Completely skewed and lacking any balance. You really showed your hand when you ended with a glowing ode to Bill Clinton. I now question everything you present. Too bad. You had a good thing going but I lived through the Reagan Revolution and know exactly what happened. One can present selective facts to portray any historical figure as positive, negative or somewhere in the middle. You chose to let your bias be on full display.
"
582,American History Tellers,5,"I'm a podcast junkie and this is one of my favorites. This is one of the most entertaining and probably the most well produced history podcast on the market. The use of music and sound really enhances the great storytelling. I've enjoyed all of the series; I've learned something from all of them, even topics I'm very familiar with like the American Revolution. The series on the National Parks was fantastic as well and has provided the inspiration for our next family vacation! Keep up the great work.
"
583,American History Tellers,1,"This podcast is honestly just a perfect mix of historical fact and proactive story telling that keeps you intrigued and eager to hear more, and you're learning at the same time! What's not to like?
"
584,American History Tellers,5,"In the early days, people were ""glued"" to the radio. Then they were ""glued"" to the TV. Now, I officially use the first reference I know of: I'm ""glued"" to this podcast. Why? This is not just a comprehensive ""survey"" of American history. This agenda-less podcast captures your attention and fascination as it delves into the sentiments, the feelings of the times by placing you in the perspective of US citizens and leaders of the day. Most importantly, in my opinion, it is fair in it's treatment toward our history, and quite fair in the various viewpoints presented. It's just the right mixture of summary, fact, feeling, and entertainment-- a mind-meld with US history. I enjoyed the Revolution series, but given the pre-revolution colonial history, how can the Enlightment be given credit for Americans' ideals without regard for the strong reformation roots of our country? What influence had the populations that moved originally to the US for religious liberty? That's the only NPR-ish-fear-of-speaking-about-religion moment I've witnessed in this podcast, but that's mostly a my qualm with the author of the episode.
"
585,American History Tellers,5,"A great way to learn history. It's teaching while being entertained. I look forward to the next episode!!!!
"
586,American History Tellers,5,"I've listened to about a dozen American History Tellers podcasts; as a fan of American History, I find some episodes to be great refreshers, while others present information I've never heard before (the episode on Moe Berg was jaw-dropping). The new series on New Amsterdam is fantastic as well -- I'm ashamed to admit I knew almost nothing about the Dutch colony until now! I can see how trying to delve into recent history would be problematic -- perhaps prudent to stick to history up to (and including) the Vietnam War? There's so much fascinating history to cover prior to 1975! Also, for a story idea, I'd love to hear your theatrical take on the U.S. Navy's capture of U-505, which I just had the chance to explore in Chicago this past week. You could do perspectives from the salvage crew and the captured German submariners...SO much amazing and relatively unknown history to cover there!
"
587,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"I'm a relatively new listener but I have listened to more episodes than I'll admit. I almost feel like I am hanging out with these ladies when I listen, because they are so relatable. They -DO- ""banter"" as they call it.... but I really don't mind it because once they get into the story they provide details and feedback in a way that is both entertaining and interesting. Keep up the good work !!! :)
"
588,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,3,"I love everything true-crime and I really appreciate the hosts' presentation of the story. It's very conversational and informative. I literally recommend this podcast to anyone asking for a new podcast to listen to. I listened to them on a solo 6 hour roadtrip and it made the trip fly by.
"
589,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"I just found this show and it has become by far my fave. I listen so much my toddler has started singing mini morbid mini mini morbid! I am so proud :) :) Ash and Elaina make me laugh out loud all the time, and I am pretty sure in real life I would stalk them and make them my best friends. They swear, make punny jokes, and I barely ever notice when they have steered off into a completely unrelated ""one time at band camp story"" because I am having way too much fun. Maybe not for everyone but that's why I love em! Normal is boring, live long, and be a weirdo!
"
590,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"I also have a fascination with True Crime, Serial Killers, and anything spooky or fascinating. I listen to a lot of shows, but I usually start falling asleep halfway through my 1 1/2 hour drive home. This show keeps me entertained and wide awake!! I LOVE IT!!! The ""banter"" is funny, and random which is awesome!!
"
591,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"These ladies are brash, smart and do their work! that chit chat is witty and relevant to the topic. I listened to 40 episodes in a week and look forward to the new ones! keep it up, PLEASE DONT CHANGE.
"
592,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"I wish these true crime podcasters would stop trying to be comedians when they're not all that funny. I dislike having to fast forward 5, 10 or 25 minutes to get to the story too, we don't need a monologue for a true crime podcast, just tell a serious story and leave out the jokes and the teenage girl talk.
"
593,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,5,"i really tried to get into this podcast as it has some interesting names but i cannot stand the hosts. i was hoping for a story based show but this is just two people talking over each other. everytime theres an interesting point in the story,the other host interrupts with the most random comment. i tried but i cant
"
594,Morbid: A True Crime Podcast,3,"Ash and Alania are amazing hosts. They always tell interesting cases and never fail to present their best. Although they might not be for everybody that are definitely in my top 3. My fiance randomly listens in here and there due to being so invested in the stories they are telling and giving life to again. They range from disappearances to murders to personal listeners tales.
"
595,Marketplace,5,"The host is absolutely entertaining and the mix of news is broad; stretching from the immediate and important to the less timely and just plain entertaining. It is news I can use to both educate myself, solve my curiosity and provide me with insight into financial decisions I can make about my own investing strategies. And the show provides an all important economic interpretation of current events that you don't otherwise pick up on from other news sources. I find myself glued to the speaker throughout each show. In a hurry? just zoom ahead 30 seconds to the next, perhaps more entertaining or relevant topic.
"
596,Marketplace,5,"Within their scope, they are very careful and fair, I appreciate their approach to the news even when it's bad news.
I wish wish wish they would avoid talking about 'what moved the market' though. There are too many variables, too many big players making choices for internal reasons. Maybe a hedge fund manager just had a bad hamburger and another one found out her kid is getting all As. Stock markets are so irrational in specifics, even when non-exuberant, that attributing change to a specific cause is annoying and fundamentally misleading.
Still, a show worth listening to.
"
597,Marketplace,5,"as an american living outside the country i enjoy listening to marketplace to get a daily distillation of what's really happening with the economy. marketplace's first hand accounts of the job market and individual stories are great, they keep the bigger corporate story grounded in what's happening with real people.
"
598,Marketplace,4,"I enjoy listening to Marketplace every night. I turn it on as I m going to bed and listen to a review of what is happening in the business world and with the stock market. The weekend show is good too.
"
599,Marketplace,5,"Great Show. Really entertaining. It's one of my favorites.
"
600,Marketplace,5,"My day isn't complete without getting my MarketPlace fix. However, rarely does my drive home coincide with the broadcast by our local stations. I started using Stitcher when MarketPlace said I could podcast the show us that service. Ever since then, I enjoy about 5-10 different NPR shows using Stitcher, some live and some podcast. I know there are a lot of choices for podcasting, but Stitcher and MarketPlace got me started and I want to be loyal!
"
601,Marketplace,5,"I try to never miss an episode--it gives you the backstory and the illuminates the day's business and economic headlines, without an agenda & in an entertaining way. It has given me the ability to make sense out of the economy & to be interested in the economic news of the day, something very useful in understanding better decisions I need to make with regard to my own finances and investments. Bravo Marketplace!
"
602,Marketplace,5,"I look forward to hearing Marketplace on my drive home and if I would miss its usual local time I will wait until its available on podcast so I can listen to it that way. I love to hear all the varied economic news they cover as well as the human interest stories. If I had any any qualm it would be that I want more depth, but given 20 some minutes for the episode I suppose that's more for the weekend versions. 
"
603,Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard,5,"It's kind of amazing. To be honest, the ads are more entertaining than anything you'll hear in any other podcast.
"
604,Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard,5,"I thought it would change after Buce went back to the WWE , But not at all seems very honest , I like to hear stories of wrestling from the past, don't care for what I see today, this podcast is worth listening too, enjoy
this show is much better than grilling JR, this one should be great but all JR wants to do is whine about his age and bells Patsy and losing his wife, thats Life, its gets old, now he should have some good stories but would rather whine about his life darn shame
"
605,Something to Wrestle with Bruce Prichard,5,"As always Bruce towing the company line, we all knew if he did long enough old Vincent Kennedy McMahon would take him back. But along the way we have the incomparable Conrad Thompson, asking questions, as only he can ask, and the responses filled with impressions and insight will make u laugh, cry, and probably sing. Two thumbs up each hosts hind end!
"
606,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"Sam is a deep thinking, logical, tireless advocate for reason and sanity in the world. The cool headed, methodical, evidence based approach he uses to analyze and discuss some very complex and contentious issues is both inspiring and refreshing. This podcast will make you think, expand your vocabulary and leave you wanting more. I wish we had more public figures like Sam, especially in politics.
"
607,Making Sense with Sam Harris,1,"I can see some criticisms here, and I too am wary of getting swept up in the selected guests of one man, and the opinions that he espouses on his podcast. However, the wealth of good guests that he manages to get, many of which come through the recommendations of other guests, range from good to extraordinary. There are some of the most thought-provoking podcasts on here and they are so worth the time to listen too, even the incredibly linguistically science-laden ones about free will. I can recommend them all. I do chuckle a little when he falls into the same trap as us all: falling for anecdote and confirmation bias, he is human after all, albeit a very intelligent one. I can’t recommend this enough.
"
608,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"Sam Harris is one of the sharpest thinkers of our time and does not shy away from difficult topics. His podcast conversations with other intellectuals are nothing less than feasts for the inquiring mind who strives to form an accurate worldview based on reason and naturalism. The Waking Up podcast is a much-needed source of reason in a world of religious and tribal violence and growing division of the - increasingly unreasonable - political extremes in the western world.
"
609,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"This podcast never disappoints, ever. The content is always meaningful, reasoned, insightful and, very often, utterly captivating. The most recent podcast entitled 'Through The Eyes of a Cult' is both hilarious and terrifying. A range of topics are discussed across these podcasts, but they often have a personal element to them which, in my opinion, make them even more engaging. Highly recommended.
"
610,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"Sam Harris is one of the most important (and controversial) intellectuals of the early 21st century. His calm, almost spok-like voice is calming to hear while you listen to him discuss some of the most controversial issues of the time.
"
611,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"I don't think I have disagreed with a point Sam has made yet. Always very succinctly put, always calm and collected when debating. Challenges Preconceptions and almost always wins. Any situation I struggle with morally or ethically, Sam has the answer. I wish I could speak to him directly to pick his brains. Truly a great thinker of our time.
"
612,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"What a treat to be able to listen to one of the great deep thinkers of our time!
"
613,Making Sense with Sam Harris,5,"Waking Up is one of the most thought provoking podcasts out there. Sam Harris does a wonderful job of introducing and relaying important topics. I could only wish for more episodes. I definitely enjoyed the ""Ask me anything"" themed episode.
"
614,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"I am a big fan of Steve's, his lifestyle and conservation efforts are something more people should try to emulate. Anyways, Meateater the TV show, its great, and this podcast is a great compliment to it. I like them best when an episode directly correlates with a TV ep, its like an in-depth behind the scenes. I often listen to the same episode multiple times, its fun to hear Steve, Janis, and whomever is else is on, geek out on hunting/fishing etc... While I wish this was a weekly podcast, but I respect that they have other obligations, rather than sitting in a room around some mics.
Don't forget to pick up a Hunt To Eat T-shirt too.
"
615,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"Steve and his hunting buddies are doing it right. Great hunting adventure. Well told Stories. Fresh and insightful perspectives, these guys tackle the tough issues while keeping it light and fun. Best hunting podcast out there. My Dad first turned me on to the Meateater tv show, which we watched together during the later part of his battle with cancer. He watched anything on the hunting channel, most of which I had no taste for, so when he excitedly said, hey watch this new hunting show, you will like it. Well dad was right as usual. Love the show. Love the podcast. It gives me hope for the future of hunting when the other hunting shows did just the opposite.
"
616,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"Host Steven Rinella mixes humor, powerful insight and genuine curiosity as he deftly leads the listener through hunting/outdoor topics that most folks would not expect to find interesting. This show is so far ""outside the box"" of a typical hunting podcast that it is hard to categorize as merely a hunting podcast. Rinella is arguably the most important voice in the sportsmen community and he uses the podcast to address many of the the current issues and events that are critical for hunters to learn about. Just give the show a listen for a few episodes and you won't regret it.
"
617,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"The format feels a little like sitting around hunting camp with a group of friends--friends who usually know a heck of a lot more about wildlife biology, ecology, anthropology, and history than you do. Steve does a good job at getting his guests to explain the core concepts and terminology in a digestible manner, and he and his hunting buddies add color commentary that make it interesting. It's a hunting podcast that is relevant and appreciable by anyone interested in wildlife and human interaction.
"
618,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"I can’t put into words how excited I was when meat eater became a weekly podcast. Great content, awesome hosts and guests, I look forward to every episode. I love the history and information given out on every topic. Very different from the local “knowledge” I am exposed to. For those looking for more, I have read Bison, Meat Eater, and Scavenger and each is now on my list of favorite books. Just picked up the big game guide (a plethora of pro tips in there) and looking to purchase the small game guide. Thanks again Meat Eater Crew, and I look forward to the next season!
"
619,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"What I enjoy the most about this podcast are all the recommendations. It sounds weird but I never really read any books before I start listening to Steve. Now, I can't believe I lived without knowing ""The Old man and the Sea"" and ""The Big Sky"". I also met the crew once in Bozeman (MT) at this boot store where Steve was having a seminar with free beer, what a great time.
"
620,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"Steve Rinella and the meateater crew provide one of the most entertaining and informing podcasts about the great outdoors, wildlife conservation, and what it means to hunt and live off the land. Each episode provides either a wealth of knowledge and entertaining tails regarding hunting and the great outdoors, or gives insight into the curent threats that face out wildlife and public lands. I would encourage anyone who is interested in obtaining wild meat or anyone who cares about wildlife and wild places to listen to this podcast and experience the inspiration and knowledge that it shares. Hats off to Rinella and the meateater crew for a fantastic show and for giving a voice to those who care about wildlife and wild places.
"
621,The MeatEater Podcast,5,"Steve Rinella has the unique ability to blend eloquent prose on nature with wildlife biology/ecology, current topics in conservation, ethics of hunting, critical insight into the perspectives of hunters as a community, while also having a great sense of humor and creating an all around entertaining podcast. His podcasts reach a broad audience providing valuable insight and entertainment to hunting/fishing newbies and old-timers alike. I can't speak highly enough about the positive influence he and others like him have on the sportsman community as a whole.
"
622,2 Bears 1 Cave with Tom Segura & Bert...,5,"You can tell these guys are great friends. They keeping me laughing and forget about my day.
"
623,2 Bears 1 Cave with Tom Segura & Bert...,5,"These two guys are just so funny together as always!
"
624,Stuff You Missed in History Class,5,"On a recent 15 hour drive my 8 year old daughter and i listened to many Stuff... I was psyched she kept asking for more. In between listening we talked about all the interesting things we learned. Now we play the podcasts at the beach, making dinner, to while away sick days, etc. Thanks for telling these stories with wit, joy, and humanity.They don't shy away from controversy and engage in the many facets of difficult issues. They are honest with their opinions without being overly preachy The hosts' wonder and enthusiasm is contagious. We caught history fever. My daughter has a particular fondness for ghost, pirate, and ""dangerous women"" stories.
"
625,Stuff You Missed in History Class,1,"Pretty good history cast. Not as stuffy as others in the genre. The two female hosts are fun. They sporadically read from a script so information moves along briskly but it needs full attention. Reader mail segment is good. The topics could be more interesting or less obscure, though that's not the intention of the podcast. Often one may have no interest in the little known subject of the week, but the episode should be listened to anyway. It's a hard sell sometimes. After finishing an episode I felt I would really like to hear there take on famous events and people that I did catch in history class.
"
626,Stuff You Missed in History Class,5,"I was a history major and am always interested in the topics chosen and generally pleased with the show.
What I Like: Great topics. Well researched. Interesting angles to topics one might not expect. The hosts are pleasant and courteous.
What I don't: I agree with another review who felt the hosts interject their opinions too often. In particular, they seem to have a constant need to give a modern day “politically correct” opinion for behavior and practices being discussed. Personalizing the delivery is good, but interjecting yourself in the story/content is a little much. This is really picky, but, on occasion the two hosts seem to forget they have an audience and get into a sing-song lilting conversational tone that sometimes gets hard to take.
That being said, I never miss an episode.
"
627,Stuff You Missed in History Class,4,"I love going on ""wiki journey's"" and finding out about interesting and little known history. This show allows me to continue learning even when I am unable to be online out read a book. The hosts are knowledgeable and friendly. And what they talk about is so awesome and interesting! I only detract one star because i would love if more audio editing was done. I find my interest lasts longer during shows like This American Life or Radio Lab because of their use of music, sound bites and interesting effects. Despite this i love this pod cat and look forward to each new one.
"
628,Stuff You Missed in History Class,3,"I'm sure the current hosts are nice people. However, their voices are awful for radio and they have an annoying habit of laughing at their own ""jokes,"" which are not very funny. More importantly, the topics are going downhill rapidly. Vampires in New England? A New Orleans murderer? Elsa Lanchester (a two-parter, no less!) and now we can look forward to a show about Velcro because of a fascination with textiles!!! These topics are somewhat boring anecdotes -- not history.My husband and I have had enough, and we really did try to be patient.
"
629,Stuff You Missed in History Class,4,"The majority of what they talk about is interesting, occasionally there's a boring topic. The length of each episode is shorter than the podcasts I'm used to. Some subjects are broken into separate episodes which would be unnecessary if the show went for an hour or so.
One of the girls has that nerdy nasal voice and accent that I find irritating to listen to. Worth a try if you want to learn something while on the train or out and about.
"
630,Stuff You Missed in History Class,1,"The show does have interesting random topics but I find the presenters have to put their own opinions in and don't take the context of the time into consideration or even the advances in science, medicine etc that have happened since the event happened. Could have a more editing done as well.
"
631,Stuff You Missed in History Class,4,"It seems the hosts read from a script, and have permanent nasal congestion. The always seem to umm and ahh a bit much for a medium reliant on voice prowness. However, the robotic tempo goes away when they bring their modern American PC viewpoint to the topic at hand. That does nothing from a learning point of view and in fact, that type of mentality IS in history class.
"
632,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"For years I have been wearing my jeans low and loose. People would stare and point at me and I had no idea why. One day I stumbled upon this wonderful podcast and learned that my jeans were the culprit! Ever since that day I have been wearing my jeans as high and tight as possible. Women can't seem to get their hands off me and I haven't had to wait for a table at a restaurant in months!
If you were a loser like I was, do yourself a favor and check out Your Mom's House, you might just find a whole new way to live your life and wear your jeans the Mom way!
"
633,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"I listen to a number of podcasts and I'm constantly rotating them in and out to see what I like. I've listened to a few comedians podcasts Joe Rogan, Adam Corolla, Jay Mohr, Bill Burr and more.
Aside from Rogan's which is my favorite this is a close second. The two are completely different things where Rogan's is more learning based this one simply cracks me up every time. Those other comedian podcasts I could care less for but I generally look forward to listening to this on a weekly basis.
"
634,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"If stranded on a desert island, I would eat all the people stranded with me and make a raft of their bones. Just so I wouldn't miss the next episode.
"
635,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"Mothers teach you things. Like, how to wear your jeans properly-high and tight. How to wipe, why you need to take care of your teeth, where to find dudes, and big words. These very important life lessons are discussed twice a week in the Mommydome. Get your life, support the mommies and their baby jeans, Theo Huxtable, and realize that this show is a blessing in the skies.
"
636,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"I could fill this entire space with inside jokes and references that only listeners would understand, but that doesn't help anyone. This is a hilarious podcast that posts twice a week by 2 great comedians who happen to be married to each other. Don't listen in public without headphones. You will laugh hysterically. Deathsquad approved.
"
637,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"Tom and Christina are both excellent comedians and I'm sure wonderful people in general. Listening to this podcast has helped me personally turn my life around. This is by far the best podcast of all time (for me). Highly suggested for those with an open sense of humor and want hours of ridiculous entertainment.
"
638,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"Like any good podcast, I feel like I know them both, and I am glad I do. I don't have time to go down the youtube or reddit rabbit holes to find bits of gold, but these mommies mine it and deliver it right to me! Also, their home page pic makes me laugh EVERY time I see it on it. Keep up the great work.
"
639,Your Mom's House with Christina P. an...,5,"Your moms house never fails to keep me entertained. I listen to a lot of podcasts but this is by far the best. One of the few that I keep current on. Plus they love their listeners and are the nicest people if you ever go to a live podcast. Just listen and enjoy, you won't be disappointed. 
"
640,Political Gabfest,5,"If you like political talk shows then this is the talk show for you! I have been listening to Slate's Political Gabfest for close to a year now and look forward to each weekly broadcast. I am a HUGE fan. Each show generally covers three current political topics in 20 minute long segments. The show ends with ""cocktail chatter"". The format is fantastic for learning about a new issue or understanding a current event from a different perspective. Everyone on the show is interesting and insightful. Not to mention candid and funny! The cocktail chatter is always fun and a great way to end the show. 
"
641,Political Gabfest,2,"This show is brilliant - informative, funny, thought provoking. The way the team discuss the issues is something that politicians could learn from. I can't hold any of them up as an example of leadership for my children, the partisan fighting is shameful. These guys provide an example of how to discuss and debate in a constructive way. While their political views may not be as bipolar as the typical liberal and conservative, they discuss the issues in a wholistic way and provide each other the room to have a different perspective without being 'unamerican' for having that view. Imagine our politicians working this way.
"
642,Political Gabfest,5,"John and David are fine, though John is clearly a much more thoughtful participant.  David, as everyone's boss, tends to run roughshod over the other two sometimes.  Emily, however, may be brilliant, but she's annoying and juvenile.  She makes stupid inside jokes that the listener won't understand, she giggles inappropriately, she makes reference to the personal lives of the others, and she generally sounds like a 15 year old fangirl.  If only there were a way to auto-mute every time she speaks . . . far and away the best episodes are when she's gone.  David Plotz, consider dumping her for good.  There are too much intelligent women who don't blather like tweens to keep this one.
"
643,Political Gabfest,5,"A great way to get a quick download of the week's main events from three incredibly smart people.  Emily, John, and David present different angles of the three topics they discuss, each of them bringing their own distinct specialty to the conversation (i.e. Emily is a lawyer, John is journalist with a high-level understanding of the American political system, and David is a journalist and the acting editor of Slate).  Considering that all three hold similar overall political views, there is a notable amount of disagreement which leads to thought-provoking discussions.
"
644,Political Gabfest,2,"I rarely watch TV news broadcasts, and usually read all my news; however, sometimes when times get busy and I can't keep up with the week's news online, listening to the weekly gabfest is an awesome way to keep abreast of national news and get more of an in depth look at the discussions surrounding those issues. Combined with other more local podcasts, like the Texas Tribune I feel pretty informed. And cocktail chatter is always awesome, although I have a suspicion that John Dickerson spends at least 48 hours finding his bit of chatter; they're always so intricate!
"
645,Political Gabfest,5,"By far my favorite political podcast. Emily, John, and David work so well together, and approach topics in a thoughtful (and well researched) way. A must listen!
"
646,Political Gabfest,5,"A great mix of political views that span the spectrum but always take the time to listen to each other. Partisian views are mostly (but not entirely) set aside and the discussion is always interesting. Matt Miller is the centrist, Bob Scheer is the old lefty and various guests are filling in on the right since the passing of the wonderful Tony Blankley. It's a short show (that still covers a nice range of topics) and a great way to get a quick read on what has happened in politics during the week. I listen from Canada and have for at least 5 years.
"
647,Political Gabfest,5,"Podcasts are my favorite medium for staying current with events, with the Political Gabfest being number one.  So when Thursday comes, I look forward to taking David, Emily and John along with me on one of my afternoon bike rides. Their humorous banter and their chemistry with each other is stimulating.  They bring a smile to my face, and I really feel like they are my ""friends"" and learn something new from them on each episode.  Highly recommend anyone who is interested in politics and wants to stay in the know with new perspectives to tune in.
"
648,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"I understand what they are going for but it just does not work. Nicole is just a lot and you can either tolerate her or not. The hosts don't care about the series and give any real perspective. It devolves into ""this is stupid/boring/dumb, I wasn't paying attention."" Go listen to Binge Mode: Star Wars, they do a better job at give actual substance to the series. Listen to exactly 1 episode of the series, that is all you need to determine if it's your thing. For me nothing worked and I overall think that it fails as a podcast. There is not real insight and it's not worth your time if that 1 episode doesn't capture you.
"
649,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",1,"I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was a kid. It was a bonding experience for me and my parents and it helped shape my interests as an adult. This podcast is so refreshing for me as it allowed me to see how people would react to the movies for the first time. The movies have been so ingrained in me that I never noticed the absurdities of some scenes and how funny they can be.
"
650,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",1,"I love this podcast. I've been listening since the start and continue to keep up with each new episode. I love both Nicole & Lauren so I knew before it even started that this podcast would be hilarious and they don't disappoint. I'd consider myself a casual fan of the Star Wars universe; I've gotten more into it as I had children and they love it. So I'm somewhere in between the super fans and the complete newbies Lauren & Nicole were. I appreciate their criticisms and wonder at each movie. I also absolutely love the openings of each episode with the music and movie clips. Great podcast!
"
651,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"In a culture saturated with Star Wars, what would it be like to watch all of the movies without having absorbed any of that knowledge? I can definitely relate to their predicament: I have managed to become an adult and avoid anything related to Harry Potter. I would be completely lost like they are with Star Wars if I entered that fandom now. Since Star Wars is so near and dear to me, it's hilariously frustrating to hear them express their boredom and misconceptions about the characters. It's also a fresh take. I've read and watched so many reviews of the Phantom Menace, but I've never gotten to hear the opinion of someone who watched it for the first time and barely knew anything about the world. I come back every week curious to hear what they thought about the next movie and to have my own thoughts about the movies challenged by a pair of newcomers.

652,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"I grew up in the 80's and 90's w/Star Wars, I read comics, books, played the games, collected the toys and watched all the movies and shows. But let's be real, sometimes the fanbase gets toxic and loses it's head up it's own butt. These two fantastic comedians tackle experiencing Star Wars for the FIRST TIME and it's hilarious.
If you're the type who can't take things lightly, and are just gonna brood over what you might see as ""wrong opinions"" listen to this, then go reassess your life. Likewise, if you can laugh at Star Wars, yourself, and anything else, listen and enjoy. Lauren and Nicole, with guests, crush it! It will be hard for me not to refer to ""Han"" as ""Hans"" after this.
"
653,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"Nicole and Lauren are both so funny and to hear them discover this bizarre franchise is a delight.
"
654,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"This show goes down a lot of unexpected avenues week to week. They randomly threw in an episode about fan-fiction, which they believed always included erotica, and then discovered a shared appreciation for Kaminoans on the podcast. I look forward to this show every week.
"
655,"Newcomers: Star Wars, with Lauren Lap...",5,"I love Lauren and Nicole both so much, and I also love Star Wars. Watching Star Wars while listening to them watch and not understand or enjoy while I am forced to listen without the ability to mansplain everything is some kind of bizarre nerd cuckolding fantasy that I had no idea I had. I am here for it!

656,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"With his long journalistic career, his background working in Congress and as a writer for The West Wing, Lawrence O’Donnell understands the political process like no other. His calm analysis and presentation style provides a good contrast to his colleague at MSNBC, the enthusiastic Rachel Maddow ( whom I also love). - M from Tasmania, Australia
"
657,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"Love this guy. Fantastic Show! He breaks down the happenings of politics very eloquently
"
658,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"He gives me hope and calms my spirit. Thank you Lawrence Odonnell. Thank you.
"
659,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"I love Mr O' Donnell. Long live the King! I love your energy and I so appreciate you getting the correct news out to all of us. We now have the House. Thank you!!
"
660,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"Go Lawrence! I enjoy learning about Lawrence's experience working in Congress. Informative guests too.
"
661,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"Go Lawrence! I also enjoy Lawrence's input from his time working in Washington under a congress critter.
"
662,The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell,5,"your show is a very culturally important, hopefully you will make a political change within the next 2 years. You just need to stop shaking hands with your guests on camera, its bush league. I learned that from my basketball coach in high school when I did it on the court and he was right.
"
663,Verified,5,"Well-presented, great interviews, not at all lurid (while describing the awful things this man did). So great to hear from the women who went through these experiences and managed to turn it around to bring him to justice. I only wish that the auxiliary media were available by some other means than via text message. Leaving aside the than the fact it's a US-based number, I personally won't send messages to a subscriber service. It's a common exploit in many countries to get people to sign up to a ""premium rate service"" that gets billed to your account. I'm sure that's not the case here, but it's why I have this policy.
"
664,Verified,4,"The podcast is great so far but I agree 100% with the previous reviewer about text messaging as the only way to access additonal media. A cautionary tale like this... but you want me to give you my phone number? Without even an assurance that it's a toll-free number I'm supposed to text? Why should I believe that you, dear podcaster, can be trusted with my personal information? Are you ""verified""?
Hmmm... I think I'll skip the additional media, thanks.
"
665,Verified,3,"I find it very unsettling to be asked, by a podcast, to give them my phone number to access story components. Especially in today's scam-caller culture. The decision to ask for texts makes me question the podcasts purpose. It is jarring in what would otherwise be an interesting (albiet short) story.
"
666,Verified,5,"Enthralling story of how women unite with reporters to stop a predator in the 21st century. Excellent delivery of information and exciting to hear how individuals are obtaining justice in the age of information.
"
667,Verified,5,"Verified is an important Podcast that reveals the dangers of trusting people you don't know that you connect with over the internet. A new era for our global society.
"
668,Verified,5,"As a young female, I really appreciated this story. Really will make me question my travel habits and be much more cautious. Excellent reporting and storytelling overall.
"
669,Verified,5,"Really well-presented and deeply compelling. I also love the music. For those reviewers who mentioned not wanting to text in, I sent them a DM on Instagram and got all of the photos, bonus material, etc. I look forward to hearing the next episode, keep up the great work!!
"
670,Verified,5,"Informative, great narration and a story that absolutely needs to be out there!! Cautionary tale for sure!
"
671,The Daily Show With Trevor Noah: Ears...,5,"Now I can finally follow the Daily Show without having to wait for my cable provider in the Netherlands to catch up. Thank you!
This show keeps me sane and smiling. Trevor, you are amazing and your team is the best. Thank you!!
"
672,Jim Cornette’s Drive-Thru,5,"Being a frequent and highly loved question asker, 3 of those stars are for me and my many fine and thought provoking questions that I have asked. The other two stars can be split between Jim and Brian any way they see fit.
"
673,Jim Cornette’s Drive-Thru,5,"Jim Cornette has a great sense of humor and a wealth of knowledge about professional wrestling. Jim's sidekick, Mr. Co-Host, The Great Brian Last has been a fine addition to the show since he joined. Great job, gentlemen!
"
674,Jim Cornette’s Drive-Thru,5,"This is truly the greatest podcast for historians and someone who wants an honest blunt view of WRESTLING! Mr. Cornette will make you laugh to give you insight to things you may have never known about the business or wrestlers. Thank you Mr. Cornette for all you have done for the business and for entertaining me all these years.
"
675,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,4,"I am such a Juice Scoop fan and look forward to listening to Heather twice a week on my commute into work. I was pumped when she went to two days a week since it made my long commute twice as good! She keeps me laughing and her impressions are pretty spot on, especially of Shannon Bedour and Jennifer Anniston it cracks me up. As a Real Housewives fan myself, after I watch it, I can’t wait to hear Heather’s recap on her next show. She’s such a delight to listen to and I tell all my friends that they must subscribe to the Juicy Scoop! Plus I love Jenny Poulos’ opening song, it’s a riot and I find myself singing along with it!
"
676,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,3,"I enjoy your podcasts, but Heather, please know that you in general ""talk over"" yours guests & it's very annoying. I realize that you want to insert as much as you can from your point of view, but take this time to listen & then formulate your ? It seems as though you hav something to insert before they even finish speaking. Just let the conversation flow. I feel the best podcast was the one with The peoples couch as they took every opportunity to interject as much information as they could which revealed a lot more than usual on your podcast
"
677,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,5,"Heather, you are hilarious! I absolutely love your show. You keep me sane while I am typing away in my work cubicle. We both have great love for delicious, buttery Chardonnay and the Real Housewives. Your impressions of the Real Housewives are awesome and your serial stories are great too. I hope that you will do a show in Kentucky! xoxo, Helene
"
678,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,3,"I do like her show and it IS juicy. She has great guests. OMG though does she interrupt. The Adrienne Maloof interview was hard to listen to because she kept interrupting and talking over her guest.
"
679,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,5,"I’ve been listening to this show for a while cause I like the Hollywood gossip but in the last year it seems that good stuff like serial sister has disappeared and there’s been too much emphasis on painful re-enactments of the Housewives franchises and too much time taken up with advertising Heather’s tours and show dates which I would have thought would be better placed on her website. Listening to guests is frustrating as Heather constantly interrupts and forces her views into the conversation which frequently stops guests in their tracks and I also think the swearing and incessant references to ‘boning’ make the show quite raunchy but not necessarily funny or extra juicy. The live shows are horrible, the audiences make too much background noise and the whole live thing is a hot mess. I think my association with this show will end soon.
"
680,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,4,"Seriously loving the pod! Especially now that you are two days a week! Saved by the Bell and Hannah Hart were a little boring (well...a lot boring but I always forgive) they picked right back up again! I am a devout Housewives fan and thoroughly enjoy when you discuss the episodes. Peter... yeah, Pete is Amaze! Love his Monotone...never truly excited voice!
What was up with all the advertisements at the end of the pod though! It was horrible! Other than that... I continue to obsess every Tuesday and Thursday! So...Thank you for that! :)
"
681,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,2,"Juicy Scoop has been my fav since day one, not sure however if you have changed producers or format because ep-128 was filled with sooo many sudden breaks to air an add, I get it that you count on sponsors to support your show, but the lead in needs to be better edited, instead of cutting into you saying something to you talking about your wonderful headphones, just saying, that episode was filled with may badly timed plugs.
"
682,Juicy Scoop with Heather McDonald,5,"I have various podcasts I listen to off and on, but Heather's is my go-to favorite. I listen every week while working out of shuttling my son to and from sports practice. Heather's podcast is always fun and entertaining. Thank you Heather for never disappointing!
"
683,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"This show is really really funny. Really very funny. Sometimes they talk about horses 
"
684,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"I don't even have the right words to describe how happy this show makes me. I have laughed so much and so hard listening to each episode. (Yes, I'm doing some serious backtracking.) I've even ""rewinded"" sections because it was so freaking funny, I had to listen to it more than once. Please listen to completely distract you from real life.
"
685,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"If I could write a limerick or a sonnet to commemorate your hilarity I would. I lack that talent. I only have the gift of mime. In your honor I created a new mime act that has inspired dozens of passersby at the Rialto Mall. Love You Brothers
"
686,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"My wife and I listen to this show every week without fail. It has us both laughing out loud throughout, it is especially good for 25-35 year-olds who get pop-culture references. My cheeks literally hurt when the hour is up. Suggested listening activities: folding laundry, road trip, or sitting around drinking beers.
"
687,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"If you'd put me in a ""you can only listen to one show for the rest of your life"" scenario, this would be my pick. There's no other show that consistently makes me laugh so much it brings me to tears like this one. The guys just nail my humour so exactly, it's kinda creepy. I 100% recommend this to everyone, as i do with my friends and family haha
"
688,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"Mondays are super special for me now because of this podcast - it is absolutely hilarious. The first time my husband was listening to the show, he was laughing so hard he was convulsing, so we unplugged the headset and I was hooked immediately. Even the back catalog is worth a visit. Enjoy!
"
689,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"The Brothers never fail to make me laugh. I look forward to every new episode. After I kept going on about it, my husband finally listened and told me it was my ""spirit podcast,"" so I don't know if everyone would be as susceptible to its charms, but you should give it a shot.
"
690,"My Brother, My Brother And Me",5,"Three brothers answering questions has never been this funny. I swear to God, this podcast was the only good thing about Mondays at my last job. They're also pretty active with thanking people who talk about them, which shows they pay attention to their fans.
"
691,Jim Cornette Experience,5,"I can do without the politics (they're the realm of idiots and the mentally unstable), but that is what it is. Jim and Brain knock it out of the park every time when it comes to wrestling. Jim is an encyclopedia of knowledge, as is his partner.
"
692,Jim Cornette Experience,1,"This podcast is terrible. It is nothing but Jim taking the Lord's name in vain and spewing Uniparty politics from the liberal side. If you are in to listening to the end result of what the Hegelian Dialectic does to people, check it out.
